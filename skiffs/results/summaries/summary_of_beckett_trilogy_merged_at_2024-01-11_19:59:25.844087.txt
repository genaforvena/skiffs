SAMUEL BECKETT and another person stopped, face to face, on a deserted road on an evening and observed each other for a good fifteen paces before turning towards the sea which was far in the east, beyond the fields, and loomed high in the waning sky.
They exchanged a few words before each went on their separate ways back towards the town.

The blowing of a rubber horn has given me only a mild pain in the balls.
I used to ride a bicycle and every hundred yards or so I would stop to rest.
When riding a bicycle, MOLLO Y 17, I didn't properly get off the machine and remained astride it until I felt comfortable.
After stopping to rest, I took off the horn from my bicycle and kept it about me.
The horn is still with me and I often use it to blow a motor-car horn when I see a lowered window of a stationary car.
My journey began in the second

I communicate with my mother by knocking on her skull and communicating using four knocks, one of which means yes, two no, three I don't know, four money, and five goodbye.
When communicating with her, I stick a banknote under her nose or in her mouth at the same time as I administer the four knocks.
The old woman is under the influence of ammonia and her shrunken, hairy old face lights up when she smells me.
Due to her intoxication, the old woman jabbered with a

A MOLLOY 27 was walking along a tow-path when she noticed a team of grey donkeys on the far bank and heard angry cries and dull blows from them.
The team was carrying a cargo of nails and timber, which was on its way to a car-penter on a barge.
A boatman of the barge was a man with a long white beard and a pipe who spat into the water.
She was walking to see her mother at the beginning of an ending day and had forgotten the reasons for her journey.

He believes he will meet the sergeant and his merry men again and has an impression that his mother thinks she is alive.
A certain night where he was alone, with nothing but silence and the little lights

A shepherd and his dog were walking ahead of MOLLOY and were not leaving the path.
MOLLOY identified them from the bleating of a sheep and the dog's anxious bleating.
She asked the shepherd and dog where they were going, asking if they were heading to the fields or to the shambles.

SAMUEL BECKETT and the long sonata of the dead is a character in a poem by Samuel Beckett.
Samuel has a strong sense of knowing what the words know and the dead things.
He once resolved to stop by the kerb and ask a passer-by for the name of his town.
This resolution was aborted when his bicycle ran over a dog and he fell to the ground.
The dog that was run over by the bicycle was not out on the road but in on the pavement, docile and docile at its mistress's heels.


The character MOLLOY 33 was caught by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and ages who were preparing to tear him to pieces.
A lady accused him of killing Teddy, a man whom she loves like her own child.
Teddy is an elderly, blind, deaf, crippled, crippled with rheumatism, and perpetually incontinent, spending his days indoors and outdoors, indoors and out of dtfors.

During the conversation,

Samuels BECKETT is a character who frequently betrays his emotions and often does not fully understand what is being expressed.
Samuel has a strong emotional attachment to his mother who has killed her dog.
SAMUEL feels compelled to help his mother get rid of her dog because he feels morally obligated to do so.

Sophie poked a dog with a malacca, presumably a yellow mongrel or pedigree dog, who was fatally injured.
The dog was buried in a house where Samuel BECKETT, a dog, was buried under a tree.
Samuel Beckett's wife was able to dig the hole without using a trowel or a spade and had her leg amputated at the groin due to a sick leg due to her condition.
Lousse, the house where Sophie lived, is not nearby but is not far away.


Loussc and the dog were buried without any box or wrapping, just with the dog's collar and lead and a shovel.
The dog was heavy, cold, and smelly, but not worse than an old dog, and Loussc was unable to dig the hole due to a leg injury.
They have been accused of false witness, which has led to a lifelong charge against them.
There are decaying circus clowns who got in the way of Louissc's attempts to walk, sit down, and ride his bicycle.

My mother is far away from me, but I was a little closer to her the previous night.
If I were in the right town, my mother would have been absent, whereas if I was in the wrong town, she would be present.
There was a huge moon framed in the window, moving slower than the room or the room itself.
The moon is divided into three segments, one of which remained constant, while the other two segments gained what the left side lost.
I once took an interest in astronomy, geology, anthropology, and other disciplines connected with it, including psychiatry.


MOLLOY 41 has seen a world at an end and believes that the world's end brought it forth and began the beginning of its end.
The narrator describes the place described as a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky, with no light and no wind, and no loads.
A voice speaks of a world where all wilts and yields, the ground is unfit for loads, and there is no light towards an end.

SAMUEL BECKETT has seen the moon which sailed gallant and full past his window the previous night.
The new moon has appeared before the previous one, leading south, indicating that the moon has waited for the new moon before launching forth on unknown ways.
Samuel was frightened when he saw a young and slender, possibly young-and-slim moon with a young woman on her back possibly with a shaving.
There was a period of nearly 14 days between SAMUEL seeing A and seeing her mother, indicating a significant delay in their meeting.
After seeing A, SAMU

The moon seen from Lousse's house was seen two nights before and was not on the eve of being full.
The two moons seen from the house were so alike in outline that the nalced eye could not distinguish them.
I concluded that there were two moons, as far from the new as from the full moon, entering their first quarter of their respective phases.
My nights were moonless and the moon foreign, so I had never seen the moon drifting past the window.
In the conversation, MOLLY 43 has crutches and uses them to strike pieces of furniture without damaging them, indicating

A valet helped the character to straighten the tables and chairs he had overturned and put them back into place.

The world around MOLLY 45 seems to shift, as if it has an orbital velocity.
The door in the big frosted window has shifted slightly creating a panel of white wall within its frame.
There are natural causes to these changes and nature has infinite resources.
Despite her natural appreciation for order and niceties, MOLLOY 45 is used to seeing the sun rise in the south and not knowing where she was going, what she was leaving, or what was going with her.
A missing piece of lace to fasten the hat to the buttonhole was an old piece of old lace.

SamuEL BECKETT often throws away all he has about him in a burst of irritation.
A knife, a noble knife, so-called stainless steel with a safety catch, was taken from him at the police-station without his knowledge.
After throwing away the knife, SamuEL Beckett found a very fine vegetable knife stained with rust, stained but stained but didn't take long to stain.
This knife had a dangerous safety catch which led to dangerous cuts on his fingers when he got caught between the handle of an Irish horn and the safety catch.
Despite his lack of understanding

Lousse was in the garden tending a grave and sowing grass in the evening.
MOLLO Y 47 saw Lousse through a window lit by a wild tawny light from the staircase.
Lousse gave food and drink to MOLLY Y 47 who was looking for his bicycle.
The bicycle was found half buried in a soft bush.
Despite not being able to conceive and having never tried, Lousse has a strong desire to have a child.

Lousse is suspected to have poisoned my beer with something intended to mollify me and Molloy.
Lousse made several propositions to me, which I listened to absent-mindedly.
According to Lousse's propositions, Samuel BECKT is not in the town where Lousse is currently located.
In her propositions, Lousse suggested that Samuel BERTTT would live in her home and live there as though it were her own.
She has a strong sense of smell and the smell of spike-lavender, a strongly scented flower, brings to mind Lousse’s grief

MollY 49 is a character who uses lavender to perfume her handkerchiefs, underclothing, and house-linen.
She has a lavender-bag that she made from lavender that she put in her cupboards.
During a night of listening and listening to MOLLY 49, she spent time with her, squatting or kneeling beside her while she was stretched out on the grass, lying on her back, on her stomach, and on one side.
The night was dark with no moon and no other light, giving way to the faint soughing of the

I was once in a jar which knew neither seasons nor gardens.
I was in a place where I could ask questions to keep myself from losing the thread of a dream.
The jar was threadbare and a little threadbare, but I was glad to have it.

SAMUEL BECKETT has a sensitive ear and perceives sounds as pure sounds devoid of any meaning.
 SAMUEL has a hard-of

My eye was ill-connected with the spider and I saw the world in a formal and inordinately formal manner.
I reacted in my own way to nature and to the works of men without seeking enlightenment and was not an aesthete or an artist.
After leaving the image of old Geulincx, who left me free on the black boat of Ulysses, I stayed with Lousse for a few months or a year.
Lousse is described as a person who has not the pioneering spirit and is not a pioneering spirit.
The weather in my part of the world where the

 SAMUEL BECKETT has been under the weather for a long time and has been able to distinguish between different types of weathers.
Samuel has stayed in several different rooms possibly one after the other in the parading universe.
In his head, there are several windows that open variously on the Parading universe and the house and garden are fixed by some unknown mechanism of com- pensation.
When he stayed still, Samuel was not aware of what was going on in the house or the garden and preferred the garden.
SAMUEL heard dull sounds, sharp ones and sharp ones

I am in a high wall-like garden surrounded by a high, high wall with broken glass-like fins.
The garden is protected by a wicket-gate that allows free access to the road.
I can open and close the wicket gate by day and by night.
Lousse is described as a woman who lives in a house with a garden and a house and rarely shows herself to me.
My character prefers to behave in the presence of wishes, active and contemplative, and finds the latter preferred due to my temperament.
During the day, I observe the garden, observing it

I used to sleep in a large garden but now I sleep in an extremely spacious house.
I was given a slow poison by a woman who gave me food and drink.
The woman accused me of drugged my food and drinks with noxious and insipid powders and potions.
Even if I had been drugged, I would have swallowed the poison with the same whole-heartedness as if I hadn't been given the poison.
 SAMUEL BECKETT devours with a voracity usually associated with heavy eaters.
SAMUEL ELIZABETT consumes

I have the ability to levitate in the air and collapse like a puppet when its strings are dropped, causing me to fall and lay long where I fall.
I prepare for this phenomenon much like an epileptic doctor, laying down or wedging myself where he can't be dislodged.
The meal delivered to me was made of a single dish and one slab of bread, served in a small, round, low-r rimless dish coated with red lacquer, and served on a small tray with a low rim and low rim.
During this meal, I ate the meal with my hands and drank

 SAMUEL BECKETT's health did not improve during his stay at Lousse due to existing illnesses.
SAMUEL believes that during his time in Lousse, no new symptoms of a pathological nature appeared and there was nothing unusual or unusual during his stays there.
Samu ELIZABETT experienced a sudden loss of half his half-poesucking stone, which caused him to regret it.
Lousse is described as a woman of extraor-dimensional flatness, physically speaking, with a somewhat hairy face, deep, deep voice, and a hairy face and deep voice.

"I have rubbed up against a few men in my time, but I have not rubbed against a woman before."
A woman named Ruth, possibly named Edith, has a hole between her legs which has a slit.
Ruth has a flat, eminently flat face, short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick, and has a yellow nape.
She has voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and undergar- ments whose names I forget.
I have toiled and moiled until I either gave up trying or was begged to stop, which is how

Samuel Beckett and Edith met in a dainty flat in a rubbish dump.
Samuel liked the delicate furniture in the apartment, including a couch that moved forward on its castors.
During their encounter, Samuel cut his toe-nails and rubbed Edith's rump with winter cream.
After the session, Edith died in a warm tub, which was her custom before she met Samuel.
The death of Edith caused Samuel to lose a source of revenue.

The experience of finding a man when one should have found a woman was initially repressed and forgotten by those unfortunate enough to know about it.
Only myself knew about the experience and spoke about it, with the exception of myself.
Despite having met Lousse and having fre- quented her, Lousse showed no interest in the experience.
My memory confuses the roles of my mother and Ruth, thinking of them as one and the same old hag, widowed and withered, both old and wizened.
Ruth used to speak of her defunct husband's inability to satisfy her cravings for

The character 60 SAMUEL BECKETT has left her dog's grave and has sown a garden with many many-coloured flowers and herbaceous plants.
Samuel Beckett left behind her bicycle, which she suspects to be a vehicle of some malignant agency.
A small voice told Samuel Beckett to take her crutches and get out of the shelter.
Despite the presence of a nightwatchman employed to watch over public works, Samuel BeckETT managed to escape from the shelter and found herself on a flight of stairs in a mean lodging-house which was empty before dawn.

I have been in a town for a long time and have been there all the time.
The town was waking, doors were opening and shutting and the noise was deafening.
I found myself in a narrow alley between two high buildings with little windows on every floor facing each other.
This alley is a blind alley with two recesses opposite each other, littered with miscellaneous rubbish and excrements including dog and MOLLO V 61 masters.
In one of the alcoves, I chose to sit instead of lie down, leaning against a wall and using only the tips of my crut

I have a history of backsliding and believe that life is made up of this kind of "backsliding".
 SAMUEL BECKETT advised me to use a knife if necessary.
I had a vegetable knife in my pocket which I used to open my wrist, but the pain caused me to put it back in the pocket and set off towards the least gloomy quarter of the heaven where a vast cloud was shrouding the sky from the zenith to the skylines and rain was falling with no wind.
This quarter was chosen by me because it was the one part of the

The scene takes place in a narrow, narrow doorway where a young old man is alone and shivering in the rain.
The young man approached the old man and stood beside him in an attempt to emulate the example of one jvho who made a speech.
A previous encounter with Lousse and her dog was prevented due to previous encounters with her.
MOLLOY 63 decided to go out into the rain before making the speech to avoid getting wet due to the weather.
In the past, MOLLOY has stolen small objects from Lousse, including a sawing-horse-like cross,

SamUEL BECKBTT considers a strange object that stands with equal stability and stability on any one of its four possible bases, a sawing-horse.
He fond memories of gazing upon the object affectionately and admiring it fondly and believes it has a specific function and is always hidden from him.
According to SamUEL, to him, to know nothing is nothing, not to want to know anything, and to be beyond knowledge is peace.
Upon leaving the shelter of the doorway, Samuel leveraged himself forward using crutches and began swinging slowly through the sullen air

I lost interest in knowing what town I was in and decided to leave the town.
I had been trying to find my mother and settle the matter between them for a lifetime and felt time was running out to settle the issue.
In the country, there is another justice, other judges, at first.
The sky was clearing prior to the winding in the other shroud revealing a pale and dying sky and the sun, already down, with livid tongues of fire darting towards the zenith.
This phenomenon is characteristic of my region and I have never escaped from it.
My region is unknown

I have travelled in a vast region described by Molloy as vast and vast and have never left it.
I have left this vast region many times, thinking I was still within it, but according to a feeling, this region has never left and will never leave.
Whenever I wander within the distant 66 SAMUEL BECKETT limits, I believe that things will always be the same, day after day and vigrit after night.
If regions merge into one another, it would suggest that my movements are due to a buckled wheel that carries me, causing jerks from fatigue.


The story takes place in a place where the shadows lengthen, the walls multiply, and you hug the walls to hide from terror.
The characters in the story are described as less rat-like than toads, less dangerous than rats, and less dangerous to those who know them.
MOLLY 67 was riding a bicycle low in the dark over the earth and along empty country roads.
Despite her fear, MOllOY 67 didn't miss her bicycle.
In the story, the morning is a time for hiding and for order, beauty, and justice for those who wake up, hale and hearty

"There is no mercy for the monster on the move or on the watch, lurking in his lair or in his sleep."
"The monster can benefit from milder feelings, such as gentleness and gentleness, which deflect the barrel of a lethal weapon."
The hunter is weak at heart and senti- mental, overflowing with repressed treasures of gentility and passion.
"Many a foul beast, worthy of extermination, can live on in zoological gar dens, broken only by the innocent laughter and knowiife laughter of children and 68 SAMUEL BECKETT their elders, on Sundays."

I have always believed that my land ends at the coast and not at the sea.
I once went to the sea in an oarless skiff, paddling with an old bit of driftwood.
While at the seaside, I took advantage of having a store of sucking-stones, pebbles, and stones to solve a problem.
In this scenario, I have a greatcoat and a pocket in which I can store stones, each containing four stones.
When I suck, I replace a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat with one from the left pocket of the trousers

 SAMUEL BECKETT's initial method of transferring the stones was to take three remaining stones from the right jJocket of his greatcoat and replace them with the four remaining in the right pocket of his trousers.
Samuel discovered that if he is certain of finding four different stones in the same pocket, he will always end up with the same four within each group of four.
If Samuel had eight pockets instead of the four he currently has, he could have sucked at least eight of the sixteen stones, increasing his chances of enjoying his stones until their number is exhausted.

T has the capacity to double the number of her pockets, but it is not possible without the help of safety-pins.
T's good leg began to stiffen and she needed a prop under the ham and even under the whole length of the leg to support her.
The story takes place in a world where stones are revolving interminable martingales, crushing Handfuls of sand, and sand runs through fingers and falls back on the strand of earth.
In the story, T is sitting on MOLLOY and has difficulty in sitting on the ground because of her stiffening leg.


The game involves sucking a stone from the right pocket of a greatcoat and putting it in the left pocket.
The player transfers the six stones she sucked to the left side pocket of her greatcoat.
Once the two pockets are empty, the player replaces them with the stones in the right pockets of her trousers.
I have found a solution to a problem that I believe is sound and elegant.
My solution was to put six stones in my great-72 SAMUEL BECKETT coat, five in his left pocket, and five each in his trousers.

In the MOLLOY 73 series, I sucked five stones and transferred them to the left pocket of my greatcoat.
When the right pocket of the greatcoat was empty, I transferred the remaining five stones to the redistribution pocket.
In the redistribution, I replaced the five stones in the right pockets of my trousers with the five in the left pockets.
After the redistribution of the stones, I replace the six stones in my left pocket with the six in my trousers.
I sucked stones in an order similar to the first time, which means that the first, seventh, twelfth, and twelfth res

Samuel Beckett's solution to the puzzle is imperfect but he considers his solution to be the only perfect solution.
Samuel believes that his solution would have freed him from anxiety within each cycle and for the sum of all the cycles.
He finds the uneven distribution of the stones in the puzzle to be painful and inelegant.
There was a kind of equilibrium in the early stages of the puzzle, after the third suck and before the fourth suck, but it did not last long and Samuel felt the weight of the stone dragging him around, dragging him to one side or the other.
Despite being dragged
