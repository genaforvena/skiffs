riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s, from swerve of shore to bend 
of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to 
Howth Castle and Environs.Sir Tristram, violer d’amores, fr’over the short sea, had passen- 
core rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy 
isthmus of Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor 
had topsawyer’s rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse 
to Laurens County’s gorgios while they went doublin their mumper 
all the time: nor avoice from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to 
tauftauf thuartpeatrick: not yet, though venissoon after, had a 
kidscad buttended a bland old isaac: not yet, though all’s fair in 
vanessy, were sosie sesthers wroth with twone nathandjoe.Rot a 
peck of pa’s malt had Jhem or Shen brewed by arclight and rory 
end to the regginbrow was to be seen ringsome on the aquaface.The fall (bababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonner- 
ronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthur- 
nukl) of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and later 
on life down through all Christian minstrelsy.The great fall of the 
offwall entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of Finnegan, 
erse solid man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly sends 
an unquiring one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes: 
and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park 
where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since dev- 
linsfirst loved livvy.What clashes here of wills gen wonts, oystrygods gaggin fishy- 
gods!Brekkek Kekkek Kekkek Kekkek!Koax Koax Koax!Ualu 
Ualu Ualu!Quaouauh!Where the Baddelaries partisans are still 
out to mathmaster Malachus Micgranes and the Verdons cata- 
pelting the camibalistics out of the Whoyteboyce of Hoodie 
Head.Assiegates and boomeringstroms.Sod’s brood, be me fear!Sanglorians, save!Arms apeal with larms, appalling.Killykill- 
killy: a toll, a toll.What chance cuddleys, what cashels aired 
and ventilated!What bidimetoloves sinduced by what tegotetab- 
solvers!What true feeling for their’s hayair with what strawng 
voice of false jiccup!O here here how hoth sprowled met the 
duskt the father of fomicationists but, (O my shining stars and 
body!)how hath fanespanned most high heaven the skysign of 
soft advertisement!But waz iz?Iseut.^ Ere were sewers.^ The oaks 
of aid now they lie in peat yet elms leap where askes lay.Phall if 
you but will, rise you must: and none so soon either shall the 
pharce for the nunce come to a setdown secular phoenish.
