 Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka is published by David Wyllie and published by Franz Franz Kafka .
 However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was . “How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do .
 He felt a slight itch up on his belly and tried to feel it with one of his legs . As soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder . He slid back into his former position . Found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots .
 It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven . The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad . The collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not feel particularly fresh and fresh .
 Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before . The office assistant was the boss’s man, spineless, and with no understanding . What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of service Gregor had never
 Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door .
 Gregor had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night . He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold .
 Gregor tried to get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but it turned out to be too hard to move . If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out .
 He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could . But when he had at last got his head out of the bed it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if .
 “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.” “By then somebody will have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me” Gregor lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things
 The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon . Two strong people would have been more than enough to pull him from the bed and carry him over onto the floor .
 Gregor swang himself out of the bed with all his force . There was a loud thump, but it wasn't really a loud noise . Gregor wondered why did he have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became suspicious at the slightest shortcoming?
 Gregor Samsa was told by his father that the chief clerk had come to ask him why he had missed the early train . His sister whispered to him: "Gregor, the chief clerks is here.” The chief clerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa’. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the
 Gregor Samsa's idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw . He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables . He said this morning that he is, but he isn't well, he told his father .
 Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family . Chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa’s barricade himself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer,” he called to him .
 "I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims" "Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late. There simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa"
 ‘I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already . But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home
 Gregor wanted to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk . He was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him . If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest . If, however, they took everything calmly
 The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better . He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements .
 Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair and pushed himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs . He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth .
 Gregor bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself . As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth .
 Gregor heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud ‘Oh!’ which sounded like the soughing of the wind . His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room . Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still
 Gregor’s father would stretch out his breakfast for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers . On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand .
 It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past . Please don’t make things any harder for me than they .
 Chief clerk turned away as soon as Gregor started to speak, and only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders . He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him .
 Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger . The chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him . Gregor's sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job .
 Gregor let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing . Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs .
 Gregor made a run for the chief clerk, who had already reached the stairs . His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for pity’s sake, Help!”
 The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well . His appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood . Gregor's father seized the stick in his right hand and used it to drive Gregor back into his room .
 If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient . Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in
 Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen . One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured .
 Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep . The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar . He limped badly on his two rows of legs . One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning .
 Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room . His father would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was no sound to be heard .
 Gregor felt pride that he was able to provide a life like that for his sister and parents . But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much .
 The gaslight in the living room was put out late at night . It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’s room any more until morning . For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy .
 Gregor passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger . Some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm . Gregor's sister opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in .
 Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring . In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, spread out on an old newspaper .
 Gregor's injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving . This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife . “Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?”, he thought .
 Gregor watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs . She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out . She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched .
 There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret . For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now .
 Gregor’s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking . Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough’
 Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted . Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for .
 Gregor only remained close to his sister now . Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist . It was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense .
 Despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days . It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated . Besides that, they hadn't been using up all the money Gregor had been bringing home every month .
 Gregor's father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence . During the five years that he had not been working, he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy . His elderly mother suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home .
 Gregor used to push a chair to the window and lean on it to stare out of it . He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day .
 His sister tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it . The longer it went on, the better she was able to do so . Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better . It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room .
 Gregor hid himself under the couch and waited for his sister to come back . She did not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her . He spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back .
 For the first 14 days, Gregor’s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him . He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing . Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time .
 Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, so he avoided being seen by his parents . To entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling .
 Gregor’s sister noticed his new way of entertaining himself . She decided to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way, especially the desk and chest of drawers .
 The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about . Gregor refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet .
 Gregor's mother told him to leave his room exactly the way it was before . She was convinced that he did not understand her words . The lack of any direct human communication must have made him confused, she said .
 Grete had become used to the idea that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him . She noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture was of no use to him at all .
 Gregor’s mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped his sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had . The writing desk was something that Gregor could do without, but the writing desk had to stay .
 Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all . But he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed
 Gregor's attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall of the lady dressed in copious fur . He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass . This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one .
 Grete ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint . Gregor wanted to help too—he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force .
 Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death . He crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell into the middle of the dinner table .
 Gregor fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions . His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that .
 Gregor used to be the same tired man who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings . He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons . Under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert .
 Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots . Gregor knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him .
 Gregor froze in shock when an apple flew down and rolled in front of him . There was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him . Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising pain by changing his position .
 No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor’s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury . Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility .
 Gregor had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room . But this deterioration in his condition was made up for by the door being left open every evening . He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened .
 Gregor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at home . The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier .
 Gregor's mother and sister would try to persuade him to get up but he would just sink deeper into his chair . Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes and say: "What a life!"
 Several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations . But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it .
 Gregor’s father brought bank employees breakfast, his mother washed clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers . They carried out everything that the world expects from poor people, but they just did not have the strength to do any more .
 Gregor’s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work . Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown .
 Gregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it . But his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change .
 Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her . Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life,
 Gregor was taken by surprise by the charwoman who opened the door slightly every evening and morning and looked briefly in on him . She would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as “come on then, you old dung-beetle!”
 One of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen . Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty .
 The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn’t use for the time being she would just chuck in there . The dustbins from the kitchen found their way into Gregor’s room .
 Gregor's father and mother used to eat with him in the living room, but now they ate in the kitchen . The gentlemen bent over the dishes as if they wanted to test the food before eating it .
 The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others . When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other .
 Gregor’s parents had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen . His father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat . His mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat out of the way in a corner .
 Gregor crawled onto the immaculate floor of the living room . No-one noticed him, though. The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing .
 Gregor was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin . He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway .
 The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor . His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three men before driving Gregor out .
 Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants . He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot . “I declare here and now”,
 Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it . It looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all .
 Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead . Her words seemed to give Gregor’s father some more definite ideas . He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen .
 Gregor’s sister abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair . She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of her sister as if to protect her .
 Gregor had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister . All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room . His pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort .
 Gregor's sister stood up and said loudly to her parents “At last!” as she turned the key in the lock . Gregor soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all .
 Gregor could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust . He thought back of his family with emotion and love . If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister .
 Mr. and Mrs. Samsa had to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying . Grete was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep .
 Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: ‘Just look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so long’
 Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other . Grete now and then pressed her face against her father’s arm . “Leave my home. Now!”, said Mr.Samsa, indicating the door .
 Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing . As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later . The further down they went the more the Samsa family lost interest in them .
 Mr. Samsa and Grete Samsa were writing a letter to a cleaner in the early hours of the morning . The cleaner stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report . The ostrich feather on her hat swayed gently in all directions .
 Mr. Samsa and his wife and daughter left the flat together and took the tram out to the open country . They discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad . All three had jobs which held particularly good promise for the future .
 Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady . They agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for Grete .
