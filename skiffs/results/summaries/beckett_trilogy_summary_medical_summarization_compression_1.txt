otjicr days are remarkably bare , but they pass too , hard to distinguish from themselves . it is remarkably clear that they pass remarkably slowly towards each other , unconscious of what they were doing . they chew, swallow , then after a short pause effortlessly bring up the next mouthful . the town was not far , it was two men , unmistakably , one small and one tall , who had left the town , first one, then the other and then the trough is a tavern ,

the most difficult times in the world . here , we describe a moment when together they went down into the same afar and finally met . they did not pass each other by , but halted, face to face , as in the country , of an evening , on a dry road . we report a case of a man solitary after so many years , so many days and nights unthinkingly given to that rumour rising at birth and even earlier . the stout stick was a stick , he used it to thrust

constipation is a sign of good health in pomeranians . a little dog followed him wretchedly , after the fashion of pomerians , stopping, turning in slow circles , giving up and then a bit further on , beginning all over again . the gentleman turned back , took the little creature in his arms and drew the cigar from his lips and buried his face in the orange fleece , for it was a gentleman , that was obvious . it was in thij sense , and yet no, for I did want to

the eminence of the mud and the scum is common , and it is a little of everything , apparently in nature, and freaks are common . the arc things we must not take seriously are things that we must try and discover . here we present a few dif- ferent occasions , deep down, and deep down is my dwelling , oh not deepest down , somewhere between the cows , the sky, the sea, the mountains . in my life without end I toolc my doze in the daytime and, what

this is the second last but one of a form fading among fading forms , and which I here declare without further ado to have begun in the second or third week of June , at the moment that is to say most painful of all when over what is called our hemisphere the sun is at its pitilessmost and the arctic radiance comes pissing on the midnights of our midnight . the question of whether to call her Ma , Mag or the Countess Caca , she having for countless years been as deaf as

a good rule and I observe it religiously , in spite of the difficulty I have in advancing on my crutches pushing my bicycle at the same time . so we cleared these difficult straits , my bicycle and I together . a little grey wizened pear . the reason for this regula- tion is that the ways into and out of this town are narrow and darkened by enormous vaults , without excep-tion .

the sergeant , content to threaten me with a cylindrical ruler , was little by little rewarded for his pains by the discovery that my surname escaped me for the moment and that I was on my way to my mother whose charity kept me dying . as to her address , I was in the dark , but knew how to get there , even in the darkness . he had heard , stilling her chatter , the bellowing of the cattle , that violent raucous tremulous bellowing not of cattle .

we report a case of a swoon- ing , a small pile of tottering disparates , in which the hard, the liquid and the soft were joined , without understanding how the transfer had been effected . social workers offer you free, gratis and for nothing , something to hinder you from swiping , which with them is an obsessioiv it is useless to recoil , they will pursue you to the ends of the earth , the vomitory in their hands . f did not let it

this is the first case of a man who was beaten by the storm . he had a pity on me , but he did not understand it . when I try and think riding I lose my balance and fall , it is so easy to speak in the present tense , when speaking of the past . it is the mythological present , don’t mind it , because it is already settling in my raglimp stasis when I remembered it wasn’t done . this is a very difficult time to think riding , for me 

if it had been I would have known that night , on the canal-bank , I find nothing, no night properly speaking , nothing but Molloy in the ditch , and behind closed lids the little night and a sheep entangled in the brambles and was waiting for an order from his master to drag me out . it is then too that the meaning of words is least obscure to me , so that I said , with tranquil assur- ance , Where arc you taking*thcm , to the fields or to the shamble

we report a case of a drenched earth adolescence , which was found to be a rare occurrence in the world . it was found that the earth was awoken by the sun , and the earth had a wake , for good , in April . despite the gloom , it was hid by the earth . in winter , under my greatcoat , I wrapped myself in swathes of newspaper . even farts made no impression on it , gas escapes from my fundament

we report a case of a woman who had been living so far from words so the name of my town is a small town in which a dog , duly leashed , was not out on the road , but in on on the other side . for the word once let fall I would know if it was the right word , the one I was seeking , in my memory or another , and so where I stood . this resolution was never to be carried out , an absurd mishap prevented it . here , we report the case of an old man ,

the lady , a Mrs. Loy , might as well say it now and be done with it , or Lousse , in possession of certain ideas or points of view which could only have come to me from her namely that having killed her dog I was morally obliged to help her carry it home and bury it . she had told me , for that was an insinuation I could not decently pass over in silence as I had the rest , and I made no bones about telling her I needed neither her nor anyone else , which was perhaps a this is 

it was because I knew that I was there that I had my stomachful , a mile more to %o and I would only have my stomach an hour later . if they accused me of having made a balls of it , of me , they thanked me for it too , from the depths of their rotten bag , the right lower than the left , or inversely, I forget, decaying circus clowns . for the terror of a joke which still goes on we buried the dog as he was , no box or wrapping of any kind

the moon is a huge moon framed in the window . the moon was moving from left to right , or the room is moving from right to left, or both together perhaps , perhaps, or either both together or both . but can one speak of right and left in such circum- stances? it seems certain , and yet what a simple thing it seemed , that *vast yellow light sailing slowly behind my bars and which little by little the dense wall devoured, and finally eclipsed . now its tranquil course was written on the walls , a radiance scored with

a new moon is often in good faith* excellent faith . if there then elapsed between that night on the mountain and between that evening when 42 SAMUEL BECKETT I saw A and C and then made up up that evening . the moon then filled me suddenly with amaze , with surprise . that moon then, all things considered , filled me sudden with amaze and surprise anew moon is usually in good - faith*excellent faith* .

despite the pranks of nature , it was at all events with the aid of these considerations that I grew calm again and was restored to my old ataraxy , for what it was worth . it came back also to my mind that my nights were moonless and the moon foreign , to my nights , so that I had never seen, drifting past the window , carrying 1 me back to other nights, other moons , this moon I had just seen , I had forgotten who I was (excusably) and spoken of myself as I would have of another

in the present state of our knowledge , it is difficult to go to one’s mother with things in such a state , more difficult than to the Lousses of this world , or to its police-stations . but the valet having brought my clothes , in a paper which he unwrapped in front of me, I saw that my hat was not among them , so that I said . a com- pletely unsuckable stone was found in the valets , and it was discovered that it had been taken from me at the police-

we report a case of a young woman who had a weakness for me . she was a victim of the dew , but she was not alone . despite her weakness , she squatted down beside me and began to make me propositions , to which she enun-ciated slowly and distinctly , repeating each clause several times , and finally elicited the following , or gist . the right to contemplate from time to time this extraordinary body both at rest and in motion .

we report a case of a woman who was squatting or kneeling beside me , whereas she was stretched out at my ease on the grass , now on my back . all the time she never stopped talking and only opened my mouth to ask , at long intervals , more and more feebly , what town we were in . and sure of her victory at last , or simply feeling she had done all she could and that further insistence was useless , she got up and went away , for they might understand their foolishness . this is the first case of

despite my attempts at taste and smell were scarcely more fortunate , I smelt and tasted without knowing exactly what, nor whether it was good or bad , and seldom twice running the same thing . but now as to tell you why I stayed a good while with Lousse , no, I cannot . for that is to say if I took the trouble , why should I? it was warm again the day I left , but that meant nothing in my part of the world where it seemed to be warm or cold or merely mild at any moment of the year and where the

this is the par- ciple of advertising . this period of my life is a grave charge to bring and I do not bring it lightly . the little I did eat I devoured with a voracity 54 SAMUEL BECKETT usually attributed to heavy eaters as a rule eat ponderously and with method , that follows from the very notion of heavy eating . whereas I flung myself at the mess , gulped down the half or the quarter of it in two despite the fact that she insinuated thus into the

it seems to me I ate it as , when and where it bestsuited me . it was brought to me wherever I happened to be , on a tray . for the little i ate I crammed into my mouth with my hands , and the bottles I drank from the bottle were brought separately , in a basket . but this basket made no impression on me, good or bad, and I could not tell you what it was like . then I searched high and low , often with success , being fairly familiar with the places where it was likely to have

a woman of extraor- dinary flatness , physically speaking of course to such a point that I am still wondering this evening if she was not a the name was Edith . she had a hole between her legs , oh not the bunghole I had always imagined, but a slit , and in this I put , or rather she put, my so-called virile member , not without difficulty and I toiled and moiled until I discharged or gave up trying or was begged by her to stop . it was the only position

massage , having nothing to do with the instant of bliss strictly speaking , then I feel no further doubt is justified , in this connection?a chambermaid is a sex - based , self -abuse , which is the most common - to - end - of - life affair . it is very possible that everybody knew about it and spoke about it , with the sole exception of myself . but there is one thing that tor- ments me , when I delve into all this , and that is to know whether all my life

a young man of wretched aspect , shivering all alone in a narrow doorway , suddenly remembered the project conceived the day of my en- counter with Lousse and her dog and which this encounter had prevented me from carrying out . a few minutes later I crossed the alley into the other chapel , that’s the word . at first I did actually seem to feel a little better , and settled myself in the same hypotenusal posture .

this is the first time that we have been able to affirm anything on this subject . here we report a brief review of the literature on this topic . despite the fact that my mind was still taken up with my mother , and with the desire to know if she was near her , it was gradually less so , perhaps because of the silver in my pockets , but then too because these were ancient cares and the mind cannot always brood on the same cares, but needs fresh cares from time to time , so as to revert with renewed vigour , when

the time comes , to Ancient cares . it would be hard for me to prove it . this phenomenon , if I remember rightly, was characteristic of my region . if my region had ended no further than my feet could carry me , surely i would have felt it changing slowly if it had ended . for regions do not suddenly end , as far as my feet can carry me, surely I would have had felt it shifting slowly . when regions gradually merge into one another , and this remains to be proved , then I may well have left mine many times, thinking I

we present a case of a seaside shivering expanse , to the sound of the waves in storm and calm , and the claws of the surf . a prob- lem was solved in the following way : a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat and putting it in my mouth , I replaced it in the right pockets of my trousers , which I replaced by the stone which was in the mouth . the stones were a keel grating on the shore , but they were not quite the same stones . here we report 

a few years later , the stones circulating thus might always be the same four . in this paper , we describe a case of sucking the stones in the right pocket of my greatcoat , and then transferring them in the hope of obtaining a more general circulation . the circulation of the stones four by four came to exactly the same thing as their circulation one by one .

this is to say with other it is true that the next time I could scarcely hope to suck my stones in the same order as the first time and that the sixth, eleventh and sixteenth respec- tively of the second might very well be the sixth and eleventh , if the worst* came to the worst . if in the cycles taken together utter confusion was bound to reign , at least within each cycle taken separately I could be easy avoid . in order for each cycle to be identical as to the succession of stones in my mouth , and God knows I had set

the seaside is one of the advantages and disadvantages of a seaside . for those who came towards me I saw coming from afar most of the time , that is a one of their advantages . to be taken unawares was so to speak impossible , for I turned often towards the land too . ranging far and wide over these vast flats , where nothing lay , nothing stood , my life . the only perfect solution would have been the sixteen pockets it is true that a kind of equilibrium was reached , at a given moment , in the early stages of

we report a case of my mother whose image was blunted inland , for my town was not strictly speaking on the sea , whatever may have been said to the contrary . for between my town and the sea there wal a kind of swamp which . it is true they actually began to work and that work is still going on in certain areas in the teeth of adversity, setbacks, epidemics and the apathy of the public Works Department , far from me to deny it . but from this to pro- claiming that the sea came lapping at

to all intent and purposes, I’m lost, no matter what . if I could even have bent it at the knee, or even at the hip for how could I bend it, when it was stiff?sometimes to be sure, when I was lucky enough to chance on a road conveniently cambered, or by taking advantage of a not too deep ditch or any other breach of surface, I managed to lengthen my short leg, for a short time that it did not know how to go about it . my progress suffered, from this state of affairs , and from the slow and painful progress it

this is covered by the business of my legs uremia will never be the death of me . how I eliminate urethra , is a dribble . this list of my weak points I shall never draw up , for fear of its finishing me , and perhaps one day when the time come for the inventory of my goods and chattels . if it ever dawns , I shall be less afraid of being finished than I am today . so that I would have hesitated to exclaim , with my finger up my arsehole for example , Jesus-

a char- coal-burner was born in the forest probably and had spent his whole life there . his reply was ex- ceedingly confused . he grew eloquently confused and he did not understand a word . when he turned and went back to where he lay , to examine him , I contented myself with giving him warm kicks in the ribs , with my heels .

it is doubtless in order to revive interest in this possibility , too often forgotten , that I have delayed over an incident of no interest in itself , like all that has a moral . 86 - ''as not so bad being in the forest , I could imagine worse and l could have stayed there till I died , unrepining , yes , without pining for the light and the plain and the other amenities of my region . it is not natural I should think highly of it , not because of what it was , but because it was not

we report a case of a woman whose mother was a sex slave , who was born in the middle of the 20th century . she was the first woman to be a slave to the oratio recta . he was the second woman to have been killed , and he had been killed in a carcinogen . the long halt is a long march , but it does not necessarily follow from that of the short march .

forest with all possible speed as i would very soon be powerless to go out of anything whatsoever , were it but a bower . the gloom , if it seemed less blue than before , was as thick as ever . but it is less blue because there is less green . and it is no less thick thanks to the leaden winter sky , and the black dripping from the black boughs a horn goes well with the forest if to nothing else . it was mortify-ing , to have been looking forward to the celebrated murmurs 

in my region all MOLLOY 91 were familiar . in any case , it was a plain , the plain . it was in the horizon and the towers and steeples of the adipose . if the plain was in a ditch that opened my eyes v/as the fall into the ditch , I did not see it from a we report a case of a man in an moored moor , in which the urchins fumbled in vain.he stooped down to the

we agents often amused ourselves with grumbling among our- selves and giving ourselves the airs of free men . in that case it’s hard for me to refuse , but we agents frequently amuse ourselves with gumbling among ourselves with our selves . for this kind of nonsense , he added . he wiped the lining of his bowler , peering inside as if in search of something .

son at twelve o’clock mass was inconceivable , he had escaped from mass . he was reprimanded , and he has gone to mass alone . for it was imperative my son should not imagine that he could not lie to me with impunity . and if Father Ambrose could not enlighten me . the verger had a list of the faithful and that, from his place beside the font he ticked us off when it came to the absolution . it is only fair to say that Father ambrose knew

we report a case of my son , who was diagnosed with deceit . he was able to speak from experience , but he did not know if he might go out . this is a very otiose decision but for my son, who burst in wanting to know whether he may go out.he was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand , a thing I do not like to see . but there are nastier gestures , I speak from experiences .

bicarbonate of soda is a good alternative to bicarbonates of soda , but it is not . it can be used as a substitute for bicarbonated soda . he cried , flushing with pleasure , have her swallow a few dessertspoonfuls , several times a day , for a couple months . this interview with Father Ambrose left me with a painful impression .

we are not going into the wilderness , but he’s a very good dentist , he said . my son had a way of saying papa , when he wanted to hurt me , that was very special . he was born with bad teeth , said Py , and all his life he will have bad teeth. Naturally I shall do what I can . Meaning , I was bom with the disposition to do all I can, all my life i shall do all my can, necessarily.

lucidity is one of the most important aspects of a vast organisation . we have heard Gaber speak of his childhood and of his family in extremely plausible terms . to be undecipherable to all but one-self , dead without knowing it to the meaning of one’s instructions and incapable of remembering them for more than a few seconds , these are capacities rarely united in the same individual . when I speak of agents and of messengers in the plural , it is with no guarantee of truth . for the feeling that we were the only ones of our kind would have been more than

lager is one of the most valuable and valuable lagers in the world . it is a very rare and valuable collection , which he was in the habit of gloating over daily and could not bring himself to leave , even for a few days . this is the first case of lager . he had been lacking in respect , but this was not the moment to have his adolescence .

we report a case of a young man , who was compelled to admit that he should have said Molloy and that in saying he had a weakness for this ending , whereas the others left it cold . if someone else had spoken to me , 1 would have requested him to stop and I myself would not have confided his existence to a living soul for anything in the world . the acoustics are so bad , they are a syllable . in my rare conversations with men , my reasons for doing so were

despite this he advanced 114 SAMUEL BECKETT but slowly . although he did not so much walk as charge , he swayed , to and fro , like a bear . this was how he came to me , at long intervals . but then he stopped and glared furiously about him . to conceive what had brought him to such a pass he was no better able to imagine how , left to his own resources , could put an end to it .

we report a case of a man who had a tempera- ture . savour at the time , and they must have been many , he could reflect on at his leisure or seek in company with his little friends to interpret as best he might . but at the same time I inclined his young mind towards that most fruitful of dispositions , horror of the body and its functions .

the iodex is a rare , inflammatory , and inflammatory process . it is characterized by a wide range of fibrou and fibrous , which are a major cause of inflammation . this is the first case of an acute pain shot through my knee . a few cases of acute pain have been reported .

a man like me cannot forget , in his evasions , what it is he evades . he had forgotten the bear (Baby Jack) and he would forbid him forbid the bear to hug . when he forgot the bear , he forbids him to forbid his bear . this is the first time he has escaped from the garden . in the night , interrupting my prowl , I like to go up to a window , lit or unlit , and look into the room , to see

weary of rocking herself she had gone in and lain down on her bed , leav- ing the door of her room open so as to miss none of the sounds in the house . perhaps she had disappeared to sleep . for my son slept noisily , with open mouth . the unheard a cloak is a serviceable garment and it leaves great freedom of movement to the arms and at the same time conceals them . it is essential to call forth feelings of pity and indulgence , to be the butt of jeers and h

a few years ago , my son was seen capering in the streets like the little hooligans he frequented on the sly . he walked like his father , with rapid steps , his head up , breathing even and economical, his arms swinging , looking neither to left nor right , apparently oblivious to everything and in reality in reality . when he began to shake him and help him out of bed , pulling him first by the arms , then by the hair , he turned away from me in fury , to

a scout-knife is a great tool for a young man . he had no equal for the dates of battles, revolutions , restorations and other exploits of the human race , in its slow slow and slow slow slow . here , we cried for on hearing me say we were to go to the left , as if his dearest wish was to infuri this knife com- prised , apart from the five or six indispensable blades . we were called elsewhere by the image of my son no longer behind me ,

the rage which distorted his features and made him tremble would never leave him till the day he could vent it as it deserved . but not even then . he must have felt his soul the soul of a pocket Monte Cristo , with whose antics as adumbrated in the Schoolboys’ Classics he was needless to say familiar . then with a good clap on that impotent back I said . it is within me and exhorts me to continue to the end the faithful servant I have always been , of 

this region was situated in the north of the molloy country in relation to mine , less bleak , and comprised a settlement , dignified by some with the name of market-town , by others re- garded as no more than- a village . this region represented , with its dependent lands , a surface area of five or six square square . the region was represented by a lands of 5 or 6 square and represented by its depending lands, an ad- ministrative limits he had never crossed and presumably never

the Yerk affair , which took me nearly three months to conclude successfully , was over on the day I suc- ceeded in possessing myself of his tiepin and destroying it . a most delicate affair for the person concerned was not a woman . the hour was the important thing , not the date . in some secluded place , it was only natural I should withdraw , out of delicacy .

unable to get up is a difficult task . it is easy to talk about being unable , whereas in reality nothing is more difficult . because of the will I suppose , which the least opposition seems to lash into a fury . this explains no doubt how it was I despaired at first ever bending my leg again and then, a little later , through sheer determination , did succeed in bending it, slightly . if you can neither stand nor sit with comfort , you take refuge in the horizontal , like a child in its mother’s lap

if the great classical paralysis were to offer analogous and perhaps even still more unspeakable satisfactions , that must be something . unless it is the earth that lifts itself up , to be approved , before it sets out , I shall not expound my reasoning . its conclusion made possible the composition of the follow- ing passage . it was the only way of knowing if he understood .

a new bicycle is a good idea to buy a bicycle . here , two distinct operations were involved , the first consist- ing in foreseeing the difficulty (before my son woke ) and the second in overcoming it (at the news that Hole was the nearest locality ) . there was no problem with people asking him how he came by so 144 SAMUEL BECKETT much money and he so young . in the end he had we report a case of a young boy who had a com- plexity 

agais , a man who wore a coat much too heavy for the time of the year and was leaning on a stick so massive , and so much thicker at the bottom than at the top , that it seemed more like a club . a little later , having left the shelter for some reason or other , I saw him a few paces off , standing motionless . his accent was that of a foreigner or of one who had lost the habit of speech .

the fire spit was out and a ember was out in the middle of a desert , under the midday sun , to look after him . heaviness in my leg disappeared even more quickly than when I stood supported only by my muscles and the tree life . for at the same time as I listened to my 148 SAMUEL BECKETT knee , and then submitted it to various tests , I was on my guard against the effects of this habit and tried to discount them . it was not so much Moran as another , in the secret of Moran

a dim man , dim of face and dim of body , because of the dark . here , he said , you unexpected pleasure , and moving aside from the fire which was now burning merrily , so that its light fell full on the intruder , I could see he MOLLOY 151 was precisely the kind of pest he had thought he was , without being sure . he ha*d a narrow-brimmed dark blue felt hat on his head , with a fish-hook and an artificial fly stuck in the

owls are not eagle-owl species , but they are a cry like a whistle of a locomotive . they were not oagles , it was a crying and sing at night . it was not breaking when I got up and went to the shelter . his legs too were on the stiff side, but there was still some play in the hip joints , fortunately . when looking in this way for my keys I found an ear which I threw into the copse , and they reached by rolling over and over , like

hav- ing had such a father , and offers of help and expressions of esteem will pour in upon him from every side . this third day wore away . and about five o’clock my son arrived . he was already between me and the camp , making for the latter when I saw him .

phlebotomy is one of the most common diseases in the world . it is a rare disease , but it is not a cure . here we present a solution to this problem , which was solved by a de- pairing effort . my son was tangled up and my stocking was torn and my leg bleeding . he had a sick leg . the bicycle was all right apparently, the back wheel slightly buckled perhaps.

the nis pipe of men is a sigh of joy , but it has not been known how to depart without self-loathing or sadness , or with as little as possible , if a kind of immense resemblance all round me announced it was not I who was departing, but the flock . the shepherd silent and the dog unheeded , the little flock departed . so no doubt they would plod on , until they came to the stable or the fold . he counts them as they go by the dog stops at the

we report a case of a young boy who had abandoned me , eating his last pro- visions (which he might easily have taken too ) . he had no illusions that all was about to end , or to begin again , it little mattered how , I had only to wait . for fun , and the better to scatter them to the winds, I dallied with the hopes that spring eternal, childish hopes , as for example that my son, his anger spent, would have pity on me and come back to me . in the evening

morphine is a rare form of morphogenesis . it is characterized by a variety of factors , such as the nature of nature , the woods and the waters , and the way of edibles . in this article , we describe a case of a man who conceived a dog , a woman who was a child . he conceived the dog a few years ago . the disease , whatever it was , was dormant! But to return to the flies , I like to think of those that hatch

the dance was best to be observed among the bees re- turning to the hive , laden more or less with nectar , and it involved a great variety of figures and rhythms . this phenomenon was interpreted as a system of signals by means of which the incoming bee , satisfied or dissatisfied with their plunder , informed the out- going bee in what direction to go . here their watchword seemed to be . the purpose of the hum ' is not to emphasise the dance , but on the contrary to vary it

despite its deep lesions and the wounds with which it was covered , this is the first time that I have spoken of a voice giving me orders , or rather advice . physically speaking it seemed to me I was now becoming rapidly unrecognisable . when I passed my hands over my face , in a characteristic and now more than ever pardonable gesture , the face my hands felt was not my face any more , and the hands my face felt were my hands no longer . the gist of the sensation was the a flimsiest analogy

we report a case of a cattle breeder who lost his infant boy , Ninette , and kept his mamma . she was a pity , no matter if he was known . he had never been able to invent a satisfactory reply . this incident gives but a feeble idea of my ability , even at this late period .

to grant a favor of people who are on the point of knocking your brains out sometimes produces good results . to grant such a small favour to a pilgrim on the rocks was frankly a temptation difficult to resist . it is a great thing to own a plot in perpetuity , a very great thing indeed . if only that were the only perpetuity. I came to the wicket. It was locked. Very properly. But I could not open it. The key went into the hole, but would not turn. Long disuse? A new lock? I burst it open

the rejoicings of the transfiguration will take place in my absence , this year . it is the kind of bait that I do not rise to any more , my need for prettiness is gone . in what does it differ from those that have abused me ever since I was born? I have that feeling , I have had it now for some days , but it is just as well to let myself die to-day if I wished, merely by making little effort . we report a case of a man who was repaid for his life .

man and woman in the same story, there is so little difference between a man and a woman , between mine I mean. Perhaps I shall not have time to finish. There I am back at my old aporctics. all my life long I have dreamt of the moment when, edified at last , in so far as one can be before all is lost , I might draw the line and make the tot . this moment seems now at hand. if after all that I am still alive I shall take the necessary steps to ensure my not having made a mistake .

the moon is a new city , and the moon has become familiar . she is well known now with the changes of aspects and aspect of the moon . if it is possible to get as far as London , it can be difficult to find my way about among them . this is how it is done for me every day , at the same time probably . when I want to eat I hook the table with my stick and draw it to me . it is soup. they must know I am toothless. I eat it one time out of two , out of three , on an

a precocious boy , he was not good at his lessons , neither could he see the use of them . he attended his classes with his mind elsewhere , or blank . his classes were taught . all calculation seemed to him idle in which the nature of the unit was not specified . the figures than marshalling in his mind thronged it with colours and with forms .

we report a case of a man who was confined to a school in a classroom . he was a plump rosy boy . his wrists and ankles were thick , which made his mother say that one day he would be even bigger than his father . it was thanks to Sapo’s skull that he hazarded this opinion and , in deflance of the facts and against his better judgment , was enabled to haze this opinion .

a gull’s phlegm , his silent ways , were not of a nature to please . in the midst of tumult , at school and at home , he remained motionless in his place , often standing , and gazed straight before him with eyes as pale and unwavering as he could brood on thus, hour after hour . the signs were rather those of besottedness pure and simple . he dropped his jaw and breathed through his mouth . we arc getting on , getting

a syphilitic wild beast was padded down , motionless , often standing , spellbound groaning , and threw myself on the playthings , if there were any , the excellent youth had not escaped the exchange between rural and urban areas . while within me the wild beast of earnestness padded up aqd down, roaring, ravening, rending . despite that , it isn’t the word . it was the season when the labours of the peasants reach their par

the father was known as Big Lambert , and big he was indeed . he had other children here and there , grown men and women imbedded deep in life , hoping for nothing more , from themselves or from others . they helped him , each one according to his means or the humour of 200 SAMUEL BECKETT the moment , out of gratitude towards him but for whom they had never seen the light of day , or saying, with indulgence , for they feared him . here we go none the less , to begin to understand how such creatures

pigs are alike , when you get to know their little ways, struggle, squeal , bleed, , struggle and faint away , in more or less the same way exactly, a way that is all their own and could never be imitated by a lamb , for example , or a kid . but once March was out Big Lambert recovered his calm and became his silent self again . in the old days I used to count , up to three hundred, four hundred , and with other things too, the showers, bells and the chatter of

we report a case of a grey hen in a kitchen in which he waited to be on his feet again , and in motion . he had not understood , in time to profit by it , the importance that those hours were one day to assume , for him , those long hours in that old kitchen where, neither quite indoors nor quite out of doors, she waited again . the day when it was urgent for Sapo to have this point cleared up and his mind set at rest , it was too late . for it was quite possible there was only one grey

the sound of the stone-cutters was not noble , but it was the barking of the dogs , at night , in the clusters of hovels up in the hills , where the stones lived , like genera- tions of stone - cutters before them . it came down to me where I MALONE DIES 207 lay , and he was still young . he had a long - term relationship with the earth , whose tefld him to pore upon his dream . the noises of the world , so

cxcrcise-book is a thick exercise-book . it is ruled in squares . the first pages are covered with ciphers and other symbols and diagrams , with here and there a brief phrase . they seem to stop suddenly prematurely prematurely 210 SAMUEL BECKETT at all events . this is the only way to keep an eye on him , but as far as I myself am concerned the same necessity does not arise , or does it?

the summer holidays were drawing to a close . when this first ordeal was surmounted there was no sign of any , inside me or outside me . it seemed to me, for a second, that I was going to have a visit . the c lirst which was to give them, or deny them the right to say, He is doing his medicine . for they felt that a more or less normal if unintelligent youth, once admitted to the study of these pro- fessions , was almost sure to be certified apt to M

the slaughter- MALONE DIES 213 house loomed larger and larger . thus the site of the transaction shifted gradually from the road that led to the slaughterhouse to the gates of a slaughter-house and thence to the yard itself . the look in his eye, he said, was like a jrayer to me to take him . he was able to plough and harrow the place where it lay , in which it had plodded its life away , would see it no more , toiling before the plough or the 

we report a case of a rabbit rabbit in a woman with a solitary rabbit . he sat watch- ing her , and she was crouched before the range , in an attitude of dejection . she went out with his daughter Lambert , who had no desire to sleep with anybody , saw it coming with indiffer- ence . but it is hard to look steadily for any length of time at a fellow-creature , even when you are resolved to .

r.«e now is a cult of access . it is based on the knowledge of my impotence that emboldens me to that thought . if I had the use of my body I would throw it out of the window . perhaps after all I am in a kind of vault and this space which I take to be the street in reality no more than a wide trench or ditch with other vaults opening upon it . the noises that rise up from below , the steps that come climbing towards me? perhaps there arc other basements even deeper than mine 

we describe a kind of night and day , admittedly , often it is even pitch dark , but in rather a different way from the dawn is a very short time to be the dusk , and the sun , instead of rising higher and higher in the sky as I confidently expected , calmly set, and night , the passing of which I had just celebrated after my fashion . now the reverse , as you might say , I mean day closing in the twilight of dawn , i must confess to never having exper- MALONB D

it is a misfortune , the pencil must have slipped from my fingers , for I have only just succeeded in recovering it after forty- eight hours of intermittent efforts . this is the case of a pen made in France , a long cylinder hardly broached , in the bed with me somewhere I think . it is not without some trepidation that I inspected the other great planes , above and the blKxl recedes in the long run , but it is still a gloom . the pen is whitening 

squirks that give me a no-where are well - thought , but they are perhaps better left unsaid . here again naturally 1 MALONE DIES 225 was utterly deceived squirms that get me no- where are well-meaning , well-thought , and they are maybe better left unaid , otherwise . this is a case of a squarm that has always been my dream at bottom , all the things that have always been her dream at top , so many strings and never a

it is a stratum , strata , with- out debris or vestiges . but before I am done I shall find traces of what was . how did I know it was he? The eyes perhaps. No matter , he is mine now , living flesh and needless to say male , who is like a great man for apples , to be had almost for the whinginging if you knew your way about , and a little sunshine and shelter for those who direly needed them . most remarkable of all is his greatcoat , in the sense

despite the fact that this for the moment is delicate ground , it is not much better but there is no time to lose , for all anyone would be any the wiser . it appears to him in the dreadful cries of the gulls that evening assembles , in paroxysms of hunger , round the outflow of the sewer the shambles of the horse are characterized by a series of etiologies including ecstasy , ephemera , and adolescence

the euphoria of the horses is a rare occurrence , especially in the october of april , when it is re- covered . here we report a case of the drowsiness , the little memorandum book with its little special pencil . the yawned the cabman is seated facing the way he is going or, what is perhaps even more restful , with his back to it , then it rears its head , stiffens its houghs and looks

this is the month of May , which is a month that is characterized by charnels . here , we report a case of my feet in the middle of the chrysanthemums , in which my feet are leagues away from me . a mere local phenomenon is something I would not have had to have to have .

this is the first case of a rafher 's death , and it has been reported that he was a victim of his death . he died in april 2012 , but he did not know me , or for fear of hurting his fingers . this is a rare case of the death of an aristocrat , who died a few years ago .

a window is what I have to do , such extraordinary things , fid often coloured . it strikes me to begin with is how much rounder it is than it was , so that it looks like a 238 SAMUEL BECKETT bull’s-eye , or a porthole . we have here two distinct and separate bodies , each enclosed within its own frontiers , nd having no need of each other to come and go and sustain the flame of life , for each is well able to do so independently of the other . if one may

it is not oold they are , standing so lighty clad by the open window . they must be loving each other , that must be how it is done . this is the 240 SAMUEL BECKETT kind of story he has been telling himself all his life , saying . it was sometime in the after- noon , impossible to say more , for hours and hours past it had been the same leaden light , so it was very probably the afternoon , very . TKe still air , though not cold as in winter , seemed without

we report a case of a man who had re- mained his head in a wild and practically illimitable part of the country . he tried to look at the dark streaming mass which was all that remained*of sky and air , but the rain hurt his eyes and shut them . his mouth opened and lay for a long time thus , his mouth open and his hands also and as far apart as possible from each other . for it is a curidtis thing , for the first time since his walks bare- headed in the smiling haunts of

as he could cease to suffer without the rain’s ceases on that account . a good half of his existence must have been spent in a motionlessness akin to that of stone , not to mention that he was not mistaken in holding it responsible for his sufferings and if in reality his discomfort was not the effect of quite a different cause or set of causes . for people are never content to suffer, but they must have heat and cold, rain and its contrary which is fine weather , and with that love, friendship , black skin and sexual and peptic defic

despite his lack of experience , it would be wonderful to wish Macmann , since he was incapable of picking in theory his hat should have followed him , seeing it was tied to his coat , and the string twisted itself about his neck , but MALONE DIES 247 not at all , for theory is one thing and reality another . perhaps one day a high wind would come and send it , dry and light again , bowling and bounding over the plain until it came to the town , or the ocean . it was not the first time that Macmann

we report a case of a woman who had a sex with ant' , a young woman , who was a child . she was able to walk without a stick and a fortiori without crutches , and she threw them into the sea , with all my strength as far as possible from the sea and buried them , or thrown them into sea . he was buried in the sea with all his strength , so that they would be at peace forever .

rare haz a receptacle , a bowl , and a little cap for it , out of tin , is a good idea for a hurry , but it is not de rigueur after all . in this way i disposed of things that I loved but could no longer keep , because of new loves . and often I missed them so well that even I could never find them again . a club in any case , I can not help it, I must state the facts , without trying to understand , to the end 

it is impossible for me to know , from one moment to the next , what is the change of my posses- sions . there is no guarantee things will ever be ever thus if I had a penny I would let it make up my mind . if at dawn I am still there I shall take a decision.but I dare not sleep. Rectifi- cations in extremis , in extremeissimis , are always possible after all . perhaps I should call in all my possessions such as they are and take them into bed with me

the fear of falling is the source of many a folly . it is thus that man distinguishes himself from the ape and rises from discovery to discover' , ever higher , towards the light . now that I have lost my stick I realize what it is and all it meant to me . so that that I half discern , in the veritable catastrophe that has befallen me , a blessing in disguise . to know you can do better next time , unrecognizably better , and that there is no next time and that it is not a

a more intelligent use of my stick I might have extracted myself from my bed and perhaps even got myself back into it , when tired of rolling and dragging myself about the floor or on the stairs if they wish to help me would it not be more intelligent to give me poisoned soup , large quantities . they fear an autopsy . it is obvious they see a long way ahead . to turn to them for calm and merely obtain a diarrhoea , my , that would be annoying . despite this torrent of civility , for he had

a little old woman is ill-favoured of both face and body . she seems called on to play a certain part in the remarkable events which, hopefully, will enable me to make an end . the thin yellow arms contorted by some kind of bone deformation , the lips so broad and thick that they seemed to devour half the face , were at first sight her most revolting features . in the early stages , before he had grown used to this new tide in his fortune, she assuredly left him alone as little as possible and even watched over him part of the night

we shall soon die , you and I , that is obvious . here we have the key of the medicine cupboard . stags and hinds have their needs and we have ours . it is even astonishing that you manage so well , I can hardly get over it , what a chaste and sober life you must have led . the flesh is not the end-all and the be-all , especially at our age , and name me .

the lovers who can do with their eyes what we can do mit- gations which will soon have seen all there is for them to see and have often great difficulty in remaining open and with their tenderness , without the help of passion , tetty-beshy is the season of love , let us make the most of it , there are pears that only ripen in December . let us think of the hours when, spent , we lie twined together in the dark , our hearts laboring as one ; and listen to the wind saying what it is to be

a saffron is a rare phenomenon characterized by a lack of squeamishness excusable in the faint-hearted , but which true love disdains . despite the fact that she has never smelt sweet and giving off the smell she was giving off , she was also subject to fits of vomiting . she vomited at length on the floor , and these dejections remained sometimes for hours where they fell , until such time as she had the strength to go and fetch what was needed to clean up the mess .

a market-gardener , he had*’ only one eye and wore side-whiskers . it is certainly the first time I have heard it here , to my knowledge . we were on our way to the crooked moles of the harbour . the sea , the islands, the headlands , and the isthmuses were seen pinned on the board .

if you simply must speak of people who simply must put yourself in their place , it is not difficult . the only thing you must never speak of is your happiness , that would probably havccsaed him time and trouble . this humiliation has been denied to me thanks to my aphony . my voice has gone dead , the rest will follow .

ne'er-do-well , and the lack of a sense of humour , malone wore a black umbrella and a consummate genius . he had a saline - shaped umbrella . this is the first time he has been sent by if he is looking for something in particular, it would be so nice to know .

a great striped cloak reaching down to* his ankles Macmann took the air in all weathers , from morning to night . more than once they had been obliged to go out looking for him with lanterns and to bring him back to his cell , for he had remained deaf to the call of the bell and to the shouts and threats first of Lemuel , then of the fugitive was a keeper , a thorough brute though puny in appearance , and he remained in the same place . despite

a streaih at long intervals bestrid — but to hell with all this fucking scenery . the right to be abroad in all weathers morning, noon and night , trees and bushes with outstretched branches to wrap him round and hide him , food and lodging such as they were free of all charge , superb quality of accommodation . here a fine view was to be obtained of the plain, the sea, the mountains , the smoke of the town and the buildings of the institution , bulking large in spite of their remoteness and all 

a daguerreotype of a lodge in the hflgd is a rare occurrence , but it is not known if it has ever happened or would ever happen again . here we report a case of the lodges in which the lodge lodges were surrounded by a tree that hid him and turned back up the hill . the sun was dragging itself up and dispatching on its way what perhaps would be, thanks to it , a glorious May or April day , it is doubtless the Easter week-end spent by Jesus in hell .

a young man , dead young seated in an old rocking-chair , his shirt rolleo up and his hands on his thighs , would have seemed asleep had not his eyes been wide open . he never went out unless commanded to do so , and then someone had to accompany him in order to make him move forward . when he had not txen able to determine how best , that is to say with the minimum of fatigue and annoyance , to visit them in turn .

the shite , a young man with the Messiah beard , was enlightened in tones without anger . his resistance had been the most lively , and he refused to assemble , single-handed , Pat . he retaliated with petulant taps on his hands and arms and hung there , his legs limp . in spite of this Macmann continued peevish and agitated , trying to free his arm and clung to the box , her bust flung back.

aporia is not about me . it is about me. these few general remarks to begin with . what am I to do, what shall I do , what should I do, in my situation , how proceed? I don’t know . can one be etiology without knowing what it means . if a thing turns up , for some reason or another, take it into consideration . where there are people , it is said , there are things . does this mean that when you admit the former you must also admit the latter .

this is the first time that we have been here in the past . it is not that their meaning escapes me , my own escapes us just as much . here all things have proceeded , all this time , in the utmost calm , the most perfect order , apart from one or two manifestations the meaning of which escapes my . this is not in a spirit of curiosity . if we are not able to accom - plish other natural functions it is unaware .

we report a case of a pseudocouple Mercier- Camier , who entered into collision before me . this is the first time that a person has been involved in a collision . in this article , we describe the case of an incident that has only occurred once , so far . it has only been reported once .

despite this erratic interval , my two visitors may some day meet before my eyes , collide and perhaps even knock each other down . for the interval may vary considerably , and indeed it seems to me it does , without ever being abolished . however , the interval never varies . if I were never to see the two of them at once , then it would follow , or should follow, that between their respective appearances . the only encounter I ever wit- nessed has never yet been re-enacted .

the en- closure wall of my eyes is a grey , dimly transparent , and beyond that charmed circle deepens and spreads its fine impenetrable veils . this grey, first murky, then frankly opaque , is luminous none the less . to elucidate this point I would need a stick or pole , the latter being of little avail without the latter, and vise versa . then I would dart it , like a javelin straight before me and know, by the sound if all grow black or all

it is the first time that a rat has been gnawed to death in the Caucasus , before being torn again . but it seems impossible to speak and yet say nothing , you think you have succeeded , but you always orlook something , a little yes . yet i do not despair , this time , while saying who I am, where I am , of not losing me and not going from here, of ending here the fact that Prometheus was delivered twenty-nine thou- sand nine hundred and seventy years

diseases , such as cancer , apoptosis , and cancer . we report a case of a man who died in april 2012 , in which he died . he was diagnosed with a sex - related disease , but he had not been diagnosed with cancer ; however , it is not clear if he is unable to speak .

a murmur is a plethora of formulae , which I promised myself to turn to good account at the first opportunity , that is to say as soon as I had finished with my troop of lunatics . here , we report a case of a woman who had a voice that is not mine . it is difficult to speak , even any old rubbish , and at the same time focus one’s attention on another point where one's true interest lies , as'fitfully defined by a feeble murmur seeming to apologise for

long time , it is all very fine to keep silence , but one has also to consider the kind of silence one keeps . it is my voice which has often , always , mingled with mine, and sometimes drowned it completely . he continues to testify for me , as though woven in mine , blocking me from telling me who he was . but his voice continued to testified for me, as although woven into mine . however , his voice continues to show me . in order that to happen mahood 's story is a story

a task to be performed before one can be at rest consists in speaking of oneself . it may seem natural , once the idea of obligation has been swallowed , that I should interpret it as an obligation to say something . but is it possible? Bereft of hands , perhaps it is my duty to clap or, striking the palms together , to call the waiter , and of feet, to dance the Carmagnole . thence to infer that the something required is something about me suddenly strikes me as unwar- ranted . if

the 316 SAMUEL BECKETT fact of my continuing , while they are thus engaged , to be what I have always been is naturally preferable to a lame resolution , voted perhaps by a majority of one , or drawn from an old hat . they too are unhappy , all this time , each one to the best of his capacity , because all is not well with me . if that doesn’t mollify them so much the worse for me, I can still conceive of such a thing , even that I suffer all wrong too

we report a case of an instant in which he was an instant , hobbling through a nature which , it is only fair to say , was on the barren side and tolerably deserted to begin with . if by dint of winding myself up , if I may venture that ellipse , the space in which I was marooned being globular , or is it the earth , no matter , I know what I mean . here we are launched again on the same old hopeless business , there we are

mahood is a family of children who have been a fine baby . he was always a mite , always stopping , wasn't he . since my arrival they had a subject of conversation , and even of discussion , the same as of old , at the moment of my setting forth , perhaps even an interest in life hung less heavy on their hands . the last laps* won’t take him long the narrators themselves , torn from their melan- choly thoughts , could scarce forbear to smile .

in a yard , a creature that was unable to receive the least information either from its instinct or from its observation as to whether it is moving towards the stable or away from it , and not greatly caring either way . the question of how such things are possible had long sinceceased to preoccupy me . this touching picture of my situation I found by no means un- attractive and as I recall it I find myself wondering again if I was not in fact the creature , as Mahood assured me that remarked the habitation a man with only one leg has a tendency to sink to earth

bacillus botulinus should have exterminated my entire kith and kin , but my good-will at certain moments is such , and my longing to have floundered how- ever briefly , however feebly , in the great life torrent the bacilus botularinus ought have exacerbated my whole kith . why should he have lied to me , he so anxious to obtain my adhesion , to what now that I come to think of it . to tell the truth , let us be honest at least

the tfame old gang , an.cng themselves , no matter , to hell with silence , has nothing to be done with him , let’s leave it at that , he’s not dangerous . they have nothing to fear , I am walled round with their vociferations , none will ever know what I am . he was found to have a thou-beef , which was found on the ground floor of the arena , and there completed my rounds , stamping under foot the unrec

the island is a boglands , a parabolic sweep that embraces entire boglandes , now be- tween the two , somewhere or other , and invariably unpredictable in direction , that is to say determined by the panic of the moment . here , we describe the life of which I have best assimilated and retained . if I turn, I shall not say my head, but my eyes , free to roll as they list , I can see the statue of the apostle of the shambles .

de nobis ipsis silemus decidedly that should have been my motto . it is perhaps worjjh noting that snow alone , provided of course it is heavy , entitles me this is one of their favourite devices to stop suddenly at the least sign of adhesion from me , leaving me high and dry , with nothing for my renewal but the life they gave me . this duty fell to the pro- prietress of the chop-house across the street and she performed it punctually and without complaint , beyond an occasional good- natured reflection to

we report a case of a woman blinded by the jar a few inches away . the woman , dis- pleased at seeing me sink lower and lower , has raised me up by filling the bottom of my jar with sawdust which she changes every week , when she makes my toilet . it is softer than the stone , but less hygienic* And it saps one’s energy . if we can still open and close my eyes , as in the good old days , we can no longer move my head in arjd out

asphyxia is a rare thorax , but it is still a tumefaction of the penis . this is the first case of scrota in a Suffolk stallion . it is one of the most common causes of death . here we report a case of an opportunistic occlusion , which is characterized by a lack of a cure . they have put you on the right road , led by the ha id to the very britfk of the precipice ,

in dther circumstances , I shall start asking myself it is a question of voices to keep going , in the right manner , when they stop , on the right way . here at last , it seems to me , is food for delirium What a shame if I should pitch on something and never notice i‘. another candle throw its little light and I be none the wiser . no matter, rest is one of their words , think is another . a parrot , that’s what they have to say , they who stuffed me

mammalian mammal is a higher mammmal . it has been a fatal effect on my development , my lack of memory , no doubt about it . here , we report a case of a mamal , in which a man - agerie was born . he was a suppliant , and he alone or they a many , all solicit me in the same tongue , the only one they taught me .

a gjjive is the fruit of my observations accumulated over a long period of years and constantly subjected to a process of in-duction . this is a refinement of feeling which can hardly be attributed to the dogs that come jessing against my abode , apparently never being there . it brings us up to four gathered together . perhaps it's by trying to be Worm that I’ll finally succeed in being Mahood , 1 hadn’t thought of that . theli all I'll have to do is be Jones

we have here a principle of change pregnant with possibilities , but say T succeed in dying , to adopt the most comfortable* hypothesis , without hav- ing been able to believe I ever lived , J know to my cost it is not that they wish for me . for it has happened to me many times already, without their having granted me as much as a brief sick- leave among the worms , before resurrecting me , at the precise moment when my last is favouring a doctor who held that scientifically speaking the latest breath could only issue from the fund

it is easier to raise a shrine than bring the deity down to haunt it . it is not sur- prising then she should have visions . there was a time I thought she was perhaps a near relation , mother if I say anything to the contrary again I shall be mistaken again unless I am mistaken now . the moment is at hand when my only believer must deny me. Nothing has happened.the lanterns have not been lit.not because I see no stars . not often I sec the tarpaulin weighing on my 4iea

we discuss a case of a man who was conceived as a famished man , and who , having nothing human , has nothing else , is nothing . he was born unborn , abiding there unliving , with no hope of death , epicentre of joys, of griefs , of calm . the one outside of life we always were in toe end , all ojr long vain life long . it is a question of voices , no other image is appropriate .

if they ever succeed in getting me to give a voice to Worm , in a moment of euphory , perhaps perhaps perhaps maybe perhaps I’ll succeed in making it mine . there we have the stake . they won’t. Did they ever get Mahood to speak? I think Murphy spoke now and then , the others too perhaps, I don’t remember , but it was clumsily done , you could sec the ventriloquist . now we have a sleight of hand accomplished , and we must speak

we report a case of a young man who was a child whose name they call me by , and no other . he was born a few years ago , but he died a year after his death . this is the first time he had been born . it has been reported that he did not have a life - threatening illness . but it seems to me to remember what I was like when I was Worm , which is even more deplorable , that I could become Worm again , if I were left in peace 

this is the first case of a woman born in a tain . he was born a few years ago , but he had not been conceived . the first time he died , and the second day was restored , the same as in the past . this is a case of an unthinkable ancestor of whom nothing can be said . in this case report , we discuss the ancestry of this woman , who is on my way .

a head has grown out of his ear , the better to enrage him , that must be it . the circumvolutionisation will be seen too later , when they get him out . it is difficult not to suppose them sustained by some form of remark . but what is the nature of the change they are on the !oo‘: out for , gluing one eye tef the hole and closing the other . they have no pedagogic purpose in view . there is no question of imparting to him any instruction whatso- ever

the purpose of this study was to examine the etiology of the sex of a young man , who was born in the neoplasm . he was born and raised in the middle of the 20th century , and he died in the early 70s . in the present study , he had a history of euphoria , which he inherited from his father , but he did not have a life -warrant . it is strange they do not go and fetch him in his den , since the>

blather is a neoplasm of the etiology , which is characterized by a series of symbiosis . it is based on the adolescence of the brain , and the resemblance of a human body . the saline - based , affluent - and bftkering , is the first - line - of - mind - to - body , in which he is unable to be able to

we report a case of a man who died in a hospital in sydney , california , in january 2012 . he was a young man , and he had a heart that is on its waltz in his ear . in this case report , we describe a woman with a history of tetralay pom . we must stick to the facts , for what else is there , to stick to cling to , when all founders, but the facts are there 

to take me in hand again , or I’d stop, stop listening , is it possible that one day I shall stop listening with- out having to fear the worst namely , I don’t know , whs| can be worse than this , a woman’s voice perhaps, they might engage a soprano . let us leave these dreams and try again . if only I knew what they want, they want me to be Worm , but I was commanded to say whether yes or no they filled up the holes , have you filled up them yes or

this is the first time he has been suffering as much as the second day , as he is at the centre , and drive him back there , after forty or fifty vain excursions? do a uniform suffering preferable to one which , by its ups and downs , is liable at certain moments to encourage the view that perhaps after all it is not eternal? a little fit of impatience , on the part of the patient , will be given lessons in keeping quiet .

to listen for the moan that never comes, that’s not a lift? worth living either . this is my punish- ment , my crime is my punishment , that's what they judge me for , I expiate vilely , like a pig , dumb, uncomprehending possessed of no utterance but theirs . ifc no more talk about anything , it’s the only sound , as if I were speaking to myself , out lojr.d , in the end you don’t know

this meaningless voice which prevents you from being nothing but to get to the end, or fly from it , or wait for it, trembling or not , resigned or not, the nuisance of doing over , and of being , same thing , for one who could never do, never be . it should never have been lit , nor it shouldn't have been fed ; or it should have been put out , put out, it should had been let go out . if one can call that respite , it’s high time to offer it some

mahood too is a great weeper , in case it hasn’t been mentioned , his beard is soaking with the muck , it’s quite ridiculous , especially as it doesn’t relieve him in the slightest , what could it possibly relieve him of , the poor brute is as cold as a fish , incapable even of cursing his creator . the time they waste re- peating the same thing , when they must know pertinentfy it is not the right one . if they chose to take the trouble , and had

this is the first case of mahood being abandoned . it is a case of a mantle smear , a hairless and naked man . if ever there was one , they are beginning to come round to my opinion , after all it is possible they have one . they make me say , If only this , but the ide? is theirs , no, the idea is not theirs either . this is all a bubble , we’ve been told a lot of lies , who he, the master , by whom
