Molloy is living in her mother's room now. Molloy doesn't know how she got there, possibly in an ambulance or a vehicle, but she was helped by a man who gives her money and takes away the pages every week. The man who comes every week to take away pages and gives money to the pages is always the same one and he always gives the pages back with the previous week's pages, which are marked with signs that I can't read. Despite the money and the pages being taken away by the man every week, she doesn't work for money and doesn't have any money left. She doesn't sleep in her room and she has her room to herself. She has no idea how to work any more and doesn’t know how to do it. She wants to say her good-byes and finish dying, but they don't want her to.
I am a chambermaid who has taken the place of a little chambermaid. I piss and shit in her pot and I have taken her place, trying to resemble her more and more. I need a son, but I don't believe I have one. I have forgotten how to spell and half the words, but it doesn't matter as I can't spell any more. The chambermaid was not true love and her true love was in another place. I know that I have a son who is nearly as old as myself. He comes to see me every Sunday and some other days he comes only when he's thirsty. I believe that I've begun all wrong and that I should have begun differently.
The narrator has a premonition of the end of a world and a future where all grows dim and sounds fade, leading to blindness. The narrator believes that the head is responsible for this dimness and that it doesn't work any more. The head suggests that the world is about to end and suggests that there will be a last time or two or three more instances of dimness before it stops working.The narrator tries to pay attention to the dim things and considers with attention all those dim things, questioning if it's her fault for the dimness, but finds it hard to formulate the thought of goodbye.
The scene takes place on a country road with no hedges or ditches or any kind of edge, in a country where cows are chewing in enormous fields, lying and stand- ing in the evening silence. The road is hard and white and rises and falls at the whim of hills and hollows, leading to a town not far away. Two men, one small and one tall, have left the town and retraced their steps, one of them weary or remembering a duty. They both wear greatcoats and are unmistakably alike, but they look alike no more than others do. The air was sharp and they couldn't have seen each other due to the wide space between them and the undulating land. Eventually, they went down into the same trough and in this trough they met.
They did not pass each other by, but stopped, face to face, as in the country, on a deserted road, on an evening, and observed each other for a good fifteen paces before stopping. They turned towards the sea which, far in the east, beyond the fields, loomed high in the waning sky. They exchanged a few words before each went on his way back towards the town. SAMUEL BECKETT went with uncertain steps and often stopped to look about him, like someone trying to fix landmarks in his mind, as if he might have to retrace his steps in the future.
He has seen many places, including the plain, the sea, and the selfsame hills that some call mountains, indigo in places in the evening light, with serried ranges, cloven with hidden valleys, and marked by signs that can be divined from sudden shifts of colour and signs for which there are no words or thoughts. He has seen these hills from afar before, but now he knows them better, and if he ever sees them from afar again, he will see them with other eyes. He knows the inner space, the brain, heart, and other caverns where thought and feeling dance their sabbath. He looks old and has been solitary for many years due to that rumour rising at birth and even earlier.
A man was carrying a stout stick which he used as a weapon against dogs and marauders. The man was innocent, greatly innocent, and had nothing to fear. He carried the stick to propel himself onward or as a defence against these creatures. He wore a cocked hat and I remember being struck by it, as I wouldn't have been for example by a cap or a bowler. I watched him recede, overtaken by his anxiety, which I believe was caused by my own anxiety over-taking him. I was perched higher than the road’s highest point and flattened against a rock the same colour as myself, grey, which he probably saw.
A landmark is a place where a man would look for something after a long lapse of time, such as a lost thing, or to look for lost things or to destroy something. However, a landmark is not necessarily a landmark, because a man's eyes would search out the rock, not the haphazard shadow of an un-stable fugitive thing. The man I saw didn't see me because he was in no humour for that evening and was not in any humour for all that doesn't stir, or stirs so slowly that a child would scorn it, let alone an old man. I watched him recede and felt the temptation to get up and follow him, to catch up with him one day, to know him better and be less lonely. I saw him only darkly, because of the dark and because of terrain, in which he disappeared from time to
A wayfarer, A or C, who I don't remember, is returning to the town he had just left. He was bare-headed, wore sand-12 SAMUEL BECKETT shoes, and smoked a cigar. He moved with a kind of loitering indolence and a pomeranian dog following him.
An orange pomeranian dog followed a gentleman who was carrying an orange fleece. Constipation is a sign of good health in pomeranians. The gentleman turned back and took the little creature in his arms, drew a cigar from his lips, and buried his face in the fleece, indicating that he was a gentleman. The dog followed the gentleman's path, stopping, turning in slow circles, giving up and starting all over again, indicating the dog's distress. It was obvious that the gentleman was carrying a cigar and not the dog.
The character MOLLOY 13 is a man who has lost his arms and is without arms. He has a smoking object in his hand. He disappeared, his head resting on his chest, with the object he was holding. The character has the ability to turn away from things about to disappear and to watch them disappear out of sight. MOLLY 13 has a crutches and is lame, but he has the strength to chase after the mangy cur he has met. The mangy dog, a dog named ^nan, is frightened and feels sorry for him, he is a little frightened of him and disgusted by him. The dog hears the man's cries and waits for him on the road and is scared of him.
The character believes everything he is told and swallows everything he's told because he's disbelieved too much in his long life. He believes the stories he's been told and appreciates them greedily. The character has a deep desire to know more about the person he's talking to and is open to learning more about him through stories. He has a strong interest in learning about his profession and is inter- ested in it. In a moment, the character will talk about the cows, about the sky, if he can.
I was once again alone, which is unusual for me. I felt restored to myself, as if I never left myself. I believe in the laws of the mind, such as water rising in proportion as it drowns and blacken margins, and that one would do better to obliterate texts than to blacken them, to fill in the holes of words, rather than to fill them with blank and flat text. I had a weakness to return in spipt to the man with the stick, but instead of doing so, I returned to the observation post, where murmurs began again. To restore silence is the 14 SAMUEL BBCKBTT role
The hat is an old-fashioned town hat, fastened to the buttonhole of a buttonhole, always the same buttonhole at all seasons, by a long lace. The hat is fastened by a string or clastic. The hand that holds the hat moves in an arc, to and fro, and the lapel of the greatcoat opens and closes. The buttonhole in the hat is set aside for the hat, which is the reason why I never wore a flower in my buttonhole. Neither the hat nor the crutches are currently in the inventory of my possessions.
I believe that I was on an eminence, or top or on the slopes of some considerable eminence. I must have been far away, near at hand, and beneath many things fixed and moving. I believe I was dwelling deep down, somewhere between the mud and the scum, and deep down is my dwelling. I am confused about several different occasions and different times, and I am not sure which one of these occasions was the origin of my confusion. I can't believe that the man with the stick did not pass by again that night, because I would have heard him.
I sleep little and that little by day and little by night. I have tried various types of sleep and have dabbled with every kind of sleep in my life without end. I sleep in the daytime and in the morning. I do not hear anything of the moon and in my night there is no moon, and if I speak of the stars, it is by mistake. C. is a character I know from my first impressions of him. I know that of all the noises that night, not one of them was of those heavy uncertain steps, or of that club with which he sometimes smote the earth until it quaked. I believe that C. might have gone back to the town by another way too far away for me to hear its sounds.
I woke up in a distant night, divided between the murmurs of my little world, its dutiful confusions, and the sounds of the distant night. I never heard a human voice. I saw cows, but not peasants, who I never saw again. A and C I saw but never again, and I wonder if I will ever see them again. 16 SAMUEL BECKETT has a craving for a fellow, and he knows how to summon rags to cover his shame when he craves a fellow.
I needed to resolve to go and see my mother for urgent reasons. I found my bicycle, which I didn't know I had, in the same place I left it. I was crippled, but I was no mean cyclist at that period. I fastened my crutches to the cross-bar of the bicycle and pedaled with one foot on the projecting front axle. My bicycle was a chainless bicycle with a free-wheel, and it had a little red horn instead of the bell fashionable in the olden days.
The blowing of a rubber horn is among the activities which have given me only a mild pain in the balls. When I had to part from my bicycle, I took off the horn and kept it about me. I believe I have it still somewhere and I often stop and blow it when I see a motor-car horn through the lowered window of a stationary car. I used to ride a bicycle and every hundred yards or so I stopped to rest my legs, the good as well as the bad, and not MOLLO Y 17 only my legs. I didn't properly get off the machine and remained astride it, my feet on the grottnd, my arms on the handle-bars, and waited until I felt
I live in an earthly paradise, suspended between the mountains and the sea, sheltered from certain winds and exposed to all that Auster vents, in the way of scents and langours, on an accursed country. Before leaving, I am aware of the corncrakes that run in the corn, in meadows, and in the short summer nights all around meadows. I know that the journey began in the second or third week of June, when the sun is at its pitilessmost and the arctic radiance is shining on our midnights. My mother never refused to see me and she had not seen anything for many a long day since she had seen anything at all. She and I were like old cronies, sexless, unrelated, with the same memories, the same rancours, and the same expectations, but she never called me son.
Dan was my father’s name. I took her for my mother and she took me for my father. I saved a swallow and buried a ring. I remembered the day I saved the swallow. I knew more or less what she was talking about, and if I hadn't always taken part personally in the scenes she evoked, it would have been as if I had. I called her Mag when I needed to call her something. The letter g abolished the syllable Ma, which satisfied a deep and unacknowledged need to have a Ma, that is a mother, and to proclaim it audibly.
I got into communication with her by knocking on her skull. She knew me by my smell and was happy to smell me. She jabbered away with a rattle of dentures and most of the time didn't realize what she was saying due to her being under the influence of ammonia. The room smelt of ammonia, not merely ammonia, but ammonia, ammonia and her shrunken, hairy old face lit up when she smelled me. I communicated with her using four knocks, one of which meant yes, two no, three I don't know, four money, and five goodbye. I was hard put to ram this code into her brain, but I managed to do it. I stuck a banknote under her nose or in her mouth at the same time as I administered the four knocks
The distance from one to four is too great for MOLLOY, and by the time she comes to the fourth knock, the first two knocks have been erased from her memory completely, as if they had never been felt. MOLLY 19 In any case, she didn't come for money, but rather to put the idea of money into her head by replac- ing the four knocks of her index knuckle by one or more thumps of her fist, according to her needs, and she understood this method of putting money in her head.MOLLOY believes that her mother did all she could to get her unstuck, but if she never succeeded, it was because fate had earmarked her for less compassionate sewers. Nevertheless, she gives her credit for what she tried to do for her.
I forgive her for having jostled me a little in the first months and spoiled the only enjoyable period of my history. I also give her credit for not doing it again and for stopping in time when she did. If ever I am reduced to looking for a meaning to my life, I will stick my nose in the mess created by that poor old uniparous whore and find it in that old mess. I didn't come for money, but I think there was a woman who came each week.
Samuel Beckett touched a grey wizened pear. Once she touched with her lips, but she didn't seem to pleased it. Samuel Beckett was disturbed by a terrible smell that she believes to have come from the bowels of Araby, an odour associated with antiquity. SAMUEL BECKETT was distraught and felt as if she had been poisoned by the sun, which she believes may have weakened her and poisoned her while she was sleeping. SamUel BecketT was confused about the direction of her journey and found herself under a deep ditch, which is why she mentions it.
I am a cyclist who has a disability and uses crutches and a bicycle to get around. I observe the rules requiring cyclists to dismount and cars and horse-drawn vehicles to slow down to a walk. The roads into and out of a town are narrow and darkened by enormous vaults, and I observe this rule religiously. I have a bicycle and a crutch, and despite the difficulty, I have managed to get through the town using them. However, I was hailed by a police-man, who asked me what I was doing there. I understood the police's question immediately, but I didn't know what it was.
The conversation started with meanderings about a violation of public order and public decency. I was resting astride my bicycle with my arms on the handlebars and my head resting on my arms. I am disabled and rely on crutches for assistance. I understood that there are not two laws, one for the healthy and another for the sick, but only one to which all must bow, rich and poor, young and old, happy and sad. I carried only bits of newspaper with me to wipe myself when I have a stool, and I like to be in a position to do so if I have to. I took a piece of paper from my pocket and thrust it under his nose. The weather was fine and we took the little side streets, I springing along between my crut
I was in a place where the sun was hot and the heat was scorching, but I didn't feel unhappy. I felt the faces turning to look after us, calm faces and joyful faces, faces of men, women, and children. I seemed to hear a distant music and decided to listen to it. I was stopped by a man who told me to stop listening to the music. He gave me a shove and I felt a man's hard fist through the coverings of my hat. I had been touched, not by my skin, but by his hard fist. I gave myself up to that golden moment, as if she had been someone else. I wondered if there was someone among the people present who could put himself in my place and feel how removed I was from him.
At the police station, I was questioned by SAMUEL BBCKETT, who was dressed in plain-clothes, in his shirt-sleeves, sitting in an arm-chair, with a straw hat on his head and a thin flexible object protruding from his mouth, which he could not identify. Samuel BBCKetT listened to his subordinate’s report and then interrogated me in a tone which left a lot to be desired from the point of view of civility. The intervals between his questions and my answers were more or less long and turbulent. I am not used to being asked anything and I'm not accustomed to being questioned, which makes it difficult for me to answer blindly.
I have lived in fear all my life, living in fear of blows. Insults, abuse, and spits still hurt me, but I can cope with them. I have no papers, no occupation, nor any domicile, and I am on my way to my mother, whose charity kept me from dying. I know how to get to her address, which is by the shambles and cattle-markets. I had heard from my mother's room, through the closed windows, the bellowing of the cattle and the towns around her, indicating that she lived near the cattle- markets.
Molloy is a character who has a short, stiff leg and has been standing for a long time. Molloy has learned that sitting is not for her MOLLOY 23 any more due to her short stiff leg, and that there are only two postures for her any more, the vertical, drooping between her crutches, sleeping on her feet, and the horizontal, down on the ground. She feels the desire to sit down from time to time, as if she has returned from a vanished world. She has a great big Adam's apple and a big, Adam’s apple-shaped face, and her name is MollOY. She was allowed to keep her hat on, hoping to please.
Molloy's name is Molloy and her mother’s name is also Mollsoy. She was taken away to a guardroom where she was told to sit down and to remain standing, propped against the wall. The room was dark and full of people, malefactors, policemen, lawyers, priests, and journalists, with dark, dark forms crowding in a dark place. She managed to get permission to lie down on a bench and to repay a compliment to the guards who paid no attention to her. A woman dressed in black, a big fat woman, appeared before her, who was the one who gave the compliment.
The social worker gave SAMUEL BECKETT a mug full of green tea with saccharine and powdered milk, a thick slab of dry bread, and a mug containing a liquid and a cup of something to prevent him from swooning. The social worker was holding out to Samuel a mug with a greyish concoction and a saucer containing green tea, saccharines, powdered milk and a thick, precariously lodged slab of bread. SamuEL Beckett was left with a mixture of hard, liquid, and soft elements in the mug, which he found difficult to understand how the transfer had been effected. Samuel Beckett believes that when social workers offer free, gratis and for nothing, something to hinder his swoon- ing, it is useless to resist and he believes they will pursue him to the ends of the earth. The Salvation Army
I was arrested in the late afternoon and was advised to behave better by the police. I was surprised to find myself at freedom in the middle of the day after being told I could go. I am weary of this place and want to leave. I had a friend at court who helped me at court and had impressed the sergeant, but I did not know it. I have no papers and I had no money to get them, which is why the police did not insist on my getting them. My bicycle was stolen from me, but the police probably did not take it due to lack of money.
I once rested in a deplorable position, with my feet resting on the earth, my arms resting on handlebars, and my head hanging over the handlebars and I was rocking and abandoned. I consider this to be a disgraceful sight for the people who need to be encouraged and encouraged for their strength, courage, courage and joy. I have only to be told what good behaviour is and I am well-behaved within the limits of my physical capabilities. I used to be intelligent and quick, intelligent and intelligent, quick, and had the good-will of the over-anxious. My ability to improve has never ceased to grow, from my first steps until my last, executed
I have always behaved like a pig, but the fault lies not with me but with my superiors who corrected me only on points of detail instead of showing me the essence of the system and guiding principles of good manners. I had only negative and empirical notions on this subject and was in the dark, most of the time, due to a lifetime of observations which left me doubting the possibility of systematic decorum within a limited area. Since I have ceased to live, I remember the long confused emotion which was my life and judge it, as it is said that God will judge me, and with no less impertinence.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT has a past life where he thought he was merely existing and that passion had devoured him down to the rotting flesh itself. He has always cried out, more or less piercingly and openly, and has always believed it is said to be good for you to cry out. He is currently in a barracks and has a bicycle and a pebble in his pocket. The declining sun fell full on the white wall of the barracks, casting a shadow on it like being in China. The policeman on guard at the door told him to go away, but he was calm and asked for pity. He thought of the food he had refused and sucked on the stone from his pocket, which was smooth from having been sucked by him and beaten by the
A man came towards me, angered by my slow- ness, and others were watching through the windows. A pebble in one's mouth, round and smooth, appeases, soothes, and makes one forget their hunger and thirst. Inside me, someone was laughing. I took my sick leg in my hands and passed it over the frame. I had forgotten where I was going and was on the canal-bank when I remembered. I spoke in the present tense when speaking of the past, which is the mythological present tense. I was already settling in my raglimp stasis when she remembered it wasn’t done and went on her way, that way of which she knew nothing. The canal goes through the town, I know I know, there are two
I was walking along a tow-path when I saw a team of grey donkeys on the far bank and heard angry cries and dull blows. Then I noticed a MOLLOY 27 approaching a barge carrying a cargo of nails and timber on its way to a car-penter. The boatman was a man with a long white beard and a pipe, and he spat into the water. The horizon was burning with sulphur and phosphorus and I could smell the earth and the smell of the earth in the air. I hobbled down to a ditch and lay down beside my bicycle beside the ditch, beside a hawthorn-studded ditch.
I had set out to see my mother at the beginning of this ending day. I had forgotten the reasons for this journey, but I knew them and was determined to find them again. It was a simple matter of magic, a matter of knowing what saint to implore, and it was easy to know what saint one should ask. I heard a howl from the grass, indicating the howl resolving all, even if it was not mine. Meanwhile, the world around me is turning into a place of death, with the dead and the living, and all the famous flies.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is in a ditch, sinking deeper and deeper under the rains. He believes he will come back some day to a similar slough or a similar place, where he will meet again the sergeant and his merry men. He has an impression that his mother thinks she is alive, which is his impression. The character believes that he will have to get himself out of the ditch. He is trying to create a being, a place, and a situation, but he is unsure how to do it without hurting anyone's feelings.
Molloy and I were on the canal-bank and Molloy was in the ditch. I remember a certain night, a night where I was alone, with nothing but silence and the little lights of the little night and its little lights, which were faint at first, then flaming and extinguished, feeding on filth and martyrs. I find the morning, a morning, with the sun already high, and a shepherd watching me sleep and a panting dog, who was less closely watched than his master. The shepherd stopped watching me to gnaw at his flesh, furiously, and I wonder if he was waiting for an order from his master to drag me out. I don't smell like a sheep, but I wish I smelt like a buck-goat.
A shepherd and his dog were walking ahead of me, not leaving the path. MOLLOY 29 I identified them from the bleating of the sheep and the dog's anxious bleating, indicating that they had not left the path yet. I asked the shepherd and dog where they were going, asking if they were heading to the fields or to the shambles, indicating a sense of direction and uncertainty about their intentions.MOLLOY noticed that the shepherd was not going to the town but to new pastures, suggesting he was on his way to a slaughter-house, which is not confined to towns, as slaughter-houses are everywhere in the country and every butcher has a right to slaughter, according to his lights. MOllOY was surprised when the shepherd didn't reply to her question and went on his own without saying a word, instead speaking to his dog who listened attentively and listening to him attentively.
The second day began with a shepherd whistle and a dog bustling about a herd of sheep. I heard the shepherd whistle, saw him flourishing his crook, and saw him bustling about the herd, which would have fallen into the canal if not for him. I saw the shepherd and the dog through a glittering dust and through a mist which rises in me every day and veils the world from me and me from myself. The bleating of the sheep became faint, suggesting that they were less anxious. My hearing is still very good, scarcely blunted coming up to dawn, and if I sometimes hear nothing for hours on end, it is due to reasons I don't know.
The protagonist, SAMUEL BECKETT, is in a land of breeders where quadrupeds are everywhere and horses and goats are still present. Samuel is trying to get to his mother as quickly as possible. Samuel has a strong desire to reach his mother without delay and has good reasons for going there. Samus believes that the Aegean is thirsting for heat and light and has lost his sense of taste and humour early in his life due to this need. He finds the pale gloom of rainy days better suited to his taste and sense of humour.
Molloy is depicted as a chameleon, a character with a certain angle. Molloy has a habit of covering himself in newspaper during winter and not shedding it until April, when the earth wakes up. The Times Literary Supplement was an important part of his daily routine, providing him with a sense of toughness and impermeability, and it was adapted to this purpose. He has a problem with gas escaping from his fundament on the least pretext, causing him to fart frequently. One day he counted over three hundred and fifteen farts in nine-teen hours, which is an average of over sixteen farts an hour, which he finds unbelievable. He finds the frequency of his farts to be not excessive, as he hardly farts every
The character MOLLOY 31 is on a journey to find her mother. She is unsure if the MOLLY 31 road is the right one. She has read accounts of other towns as beautiful as her native town, which is the only one she knows, having never set foot in any other. She passes beyond the familiar ramparts and into a district she does not know.
X is the name of the only town in my memory that I know. I have been living far away from words for a long time. And now it was a name that was given to me by a clue. I remember finding this name and intending to stop and ask a passer-by if it is X, which is the town I live in. However, I am unable to remember the beginning of this name, and I feel sure that it begins with a B or with a P, but the other letters continue to escape me. My sense of identity is wrapped in a namelessness often hard to penetrate, as we have just seen.
I know what the words know, and the dead things, and that makes a handsome little sum. 32 SAMUEL BECKETT and the long sonata of the dead. named. I resolved to stop by the kerb and ask a passer-by for the name of my town, hoping to know if it was the right word, the one I was seeking, in my memory, or another. Unfortunately, this resolution formed as I was riding along, but an absurd mishap prevented it from being carried out.
I have never been particularly resolute, preferring to plunge headlong into the shit without knowing who was shitting against whom or on which side 1 had the better chance of success. I once had a plan to kill a dog, but it was aborted when my bicycle ran over a dog and I fell to the ground. The dog was not out on the road but in on the pavement, docile at its mistress’s heels. Precautions are like resolutions, to be taken with precaution, and the lady who ran over the dog was setting the system of nature at naught by leaving the safety of her dog at risk.
The character MOLLOY 33 was caught by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and all ages, who were preparing to tear him to pieces when a lady intervened. The lady told him that he had killed Teddy, a man whom she loved like her own child. She was taking Teddy to the veterinary sur- geon to have him put out of his misery. Teddy was old, blind, deaf, crippled, crippled with rheumatism, and perpetually incontinent, spending his days indoors and outdoors, indoors and out of dtfors. He had fallen in defence of a country that called itself his and never derived any benefit from his service.
The police constable has brought down heavily on my handle-bars and brought his big red hairy paw, causing me to notice and overhear a conversation with a lady about a man who ran over her dog. The man is identified by the lady as a police sergeant. But it's clear that the constable is under the influence of unknown reasons for reasons of which we do not know and which might put those we know to shame. The conversation is so tedious that I can't record it. Eventually, the police sergeant disperses and the dog is removed from the conversation. The lady, a Mrs. Loy, who goes by the name Mrs.
SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who frequently betrays his emotions and often does not fully understand what is being expressed. 34 SAMUEL has a strong emotional attachment to his mother, who has killed her dog. Samuel feels compelled to help his mother get rid of her dog because he feels morally obligated to do so. 34 Samuels believes that his mother understood his actions and offered him certain points of view, including that he was morally obliged to help her carry her dog home and bury it, that she did not wish to prose- cute him for what he had done, and that she found him likeable enough despite his hideous appearance. 34 Samuel has a deep-seated need to communicate with his mother and feels that he needs her, which is one of the reasons he avoids speaking as much as possible.
I often say too much or too little, which is a terrible thing for a man with a passion for truth. I often think I have said too much and too little. However, on reflection, I realize that my verbal profusion often turns out to be penury in the long run. Therefore, whatever I said was never enough and always too much for me. I was never silent. I believe in a Divine analysis that leads to knowledge of yourself and of your fellow-men, if you happen to have any. For me, to say I needed no one was to say an infinitesimal part of what I should have said, could not have said and should never have said. I needed my mother, but there were no words to express my need for her.
Sophie was poking a dog with a malacca, presumably a yellow mongrel or pedigree dog, who was fatally injured. MOLLOY 35 and believes that if she took the trouble to find them, she might find them again, but she prefers to have her bellyful some other time. Lousse, the house where Sophie lived, was not nearby, but it was not far away, and she had a bellyful by the time she got there.
Lousse lived in a house where Lousse lived. Lousse is described as having a dog named Samuel BECKETT, who was buried under a tree. The dog was buried by Lousse's wife, who dug the hole. The wife was able to dig the hole because she couldn't use a trowel or a spade, because of her sick leg. She was unable to use her rigid leg to support her because it would have collapsed and she would have preferred to have her leg amputated at the groin due to her condition.
"I longed to see them gone from the old stand where they have been accused of false witness, for and against, in a lifelong charge against me. If they accused me of having made a balls of it, they thanked me for it. They are decaying circus clowns who got in my way when I tried to walk, sit down, and ride my bicycle. I would have seen to them myself with a knife or secateurs, but for my terror of physical pain and festered wounds, which made me shake. I have gone through a life of terror and pain due to these wounds, but I have never festered.
Loussc dug the hole while I held the dog in my arms. The dog was heavy, cold, and smelly, but not as bad as an old dog. Loussc and the dog were buried without any box or wrapping, just with the dog's collar and lead. I was unable to dig the hole due to my leg injury.
The scene takes place under a larch tree, which is the only tree I can identify with certainty. MOLLOY 37 is a spectator and contributes her presence to the burial, as if it were her own burial. The tree has sea-green needles that are silk and speckled with little red specks and ticks in his ears. The dog, a Teddy, was also buried beneath the tree and when she finished her grave, she handed a spade and a hanghgan to MOLLY 37, indicating that she had made up her mind to bury the dog at home and had not asked the vet to call and destroy the brute on the premises, which makes me wonder if she was on her way to the vet when she crossed my path.
She was expensive and provided me with food and drink, but I didn't much care for good things to eat and enjoyed getting drunk. She had a parrot, very pretty, all the most approved colours, and I understood him better than his mistress. The parrot had belonged to an American sailor before he belonged to Lousse. Lousse tried to make the parrot a French sailor, but the bird said he belonged 38 SAMUEL BECKETT to a French and American sailor.
"Pretty Polly" is a character who has fallen asleep and woke up in a bed, in her skin, in a place where she believes they had carried their impertinence to the point of washing her. "If I had the address of Pretty Polly, I would write to her and ask her to come and bury me." "I went to the door and the window but was locked and barred. I looked for my clothes and found a light switch and switched on the light switch, but found no result. I found my crutches against an easy chair and a chamber pot with a roll of toilet-paper in it. "I find it strange that I was able to go through the motions without their help.
I am in a room filled with pouffes and easy chairs, tables, footstools, tallboys, and occasional tables and chairs. I set a pouffe against the easy chair and laid my stiff leg on it. There was a strange feeling of congestion in the room and a chandelier that lit the room. My beard was missing and I felt for it with anguished hand. They had shaved me and had shorn me of my beard, which made me feel uneasy. I thought I was naked, but I was wearing a flimsy nightdress. I was told I was to MOLLOY 39 to be sacrificed at sunrise. I felt perfumed, lavender perhaps. I am no enemy of the
My mother was far away from me, but I was a little closer to her the previous night. If I was in the right town, I would have made progress, but if I were in the wrong town, she would have been absent. I must have fallen asleep, for all of a sudden there was a huge moon framed in the window. The moon was moving from left to right, not so fast as the room or the room itself, but slower than the room. The middle of the moon was divided into three segments, of which the middle remained constant, while the right gained what the left lost.
I once took an interest in astronomy, geology, anthropology, and other disciplines connected with it, including psychiatry. I liked anthropology because of its inexhaustible faculty of negation, its relentless definition of man, and its concept of man as a "higher being" in terms of what he is not. However, my ideas on this subject were always horribly confused and my knowledge of men was scant and the meaning of being beyond me. Eventually, I discovered that magic had the honour of my ruins, and still to this day, when I walk there, I find vestiges of them. 40 SAMUEL BECKETT describes ruins as a place devoid of any plan or bounds, devoid of mystery and devoid of magic.
The place described is described as a place where you find yourself without knowing how to leave and where you can't leave at will. The place is described by the narrator as full of mystery and full of familiar mysteries. The narrator describes the place as a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky, with no light and no wind, no loads, and no loads at all. The voice speaks of a world where all wilts and yields, the ground is unfit for loads and there is no light towards an end.
The character has seen a world at an end and believes that the world's end brought it forth and began the beginning of its end. She also believes that she is at the end of her own suffering and withers as the living can't. She hears a far whisper, a sound which has been silent long since and she still hears it. She does not like it and fears it, but she decides not to listen to it for the time being. The far whisper is not like other sounds that you can listen to when you choose and can sometimes silence by going away or stopping your ears. It is a sound that begins to rustle in your head and stops itself when MOLLOY 41 chooses. Despite listening to the far whisper and fearing it, she will continue to hear it always.
The moon which sailed gallant and full past my window had appeared to me the night before, possibly the previous night. I was considering seeing it again when a great fright came suddenly upon me and I decided to look into it. The moon was young and slender, possibly young-and-slim, with a young woman on her back, possibly with a shaving. The new moon had appeared before the previous one, leading south, and I now see that he has waited for the new moon before launching forth on unknown ways. I am considering going to my mother for help.
In 42 SAMUEL BECKETT I saw A and C and then made up my mind to go and see my mother, which took more time than I had thought. In the time between that night on the mountain and the other night, there was a period of 14 full days, or nearly 14 days, which I believe to have elapsed.
The moon seen from Lousse’s house was seen two nights before and was not on the eve of being full, suggesting that it was entering its first quarter. The two moons seen from the house were so alike in outline that the nalced eye could not distinguish them. I concluded that there were two moons, as far from the new as from the full, and that they were merely entering the first quarter of their respective phases. It was with the aid of these considerations that I grew calm and restored to my old ataraxy. As sleep stole over me again, I remembered that my nights were moonless and the moon foreign, so that I had never seen it drifting past the window.
The conversation takes place in a room with a perfect cube and a high window. The room is described as a place where the sky and the earth take on false colours and there is an alien light which seems to have once been mine. The chandelier is burning and the clothes in the room are burnt. The valet informs MOLLOY 43 that her clothes have been sent to the dyers to have the shine taken off. MOLLY 43 has crutches and she uses them to strike the pieces of furniture without breaking them without damaging them.
The valet came back with the news that my clothes had been sent for and I would have them soon. The valet helped to straighten the tables and chairs I had overturned and put them back into place, dusting them with a feather duster as he did so. Despite being unable to do much due to a stiff leg, the valet did his best to restore the objects he had overturned, demonstrating that he has no grudge.
The character is an oriental, a vague oriental who wears white trousers, a white shirt, a yellow waistcoat, a 44 SAMUEL BECKETT chamois, and brass buttons and sandals with brass buttons, and a brass-strapped sandal strap. The character has a bicycle, which she refers to as her bicycle. She has a nightdress that is pink and transparent and adorned with ribands, frills, and lape, and she flicked them one by one with the tail of her nightdress. She takes cognisance of the clothes that people wear and is happy to give them the benefit of her knowledge of them. The conversation all morning had been about clothes and she had been saying words to this effect.
The world around me seems to shift, as if it has an orbital velocity of its own. The door in the big frosted window has shifted slightly, creating a panel of white wall within its frame. I am willing to concede that there are natural causes to all these changes, and that nature has infinite resources. I was not natural enough to appreciate the order of things and appreciate its niceties, but I was used to seeing the sun rise in the south and not knowing where I was going, what I was leaving, or what was going with me. It is difficult to go to one's mother with things in such a state, more difficult than to the Lousses of this world or to its police-stations or other places that are waiting for one. My hat was not among the clothes that the valet brought for me, so I asked for it.
The missing piece of lace to fasten the hat to the buttonhole of MOLLOY 45's hat was an old piece of old lace. The bicycle was expected to be hidden somewhere below stairs or before the front door, but MOLLY 45 decided not to ask for it again, as she did not want to submit him and herself to a fresh ordeal. In the pockets of her clothes, she discovered that certain things were missing, including her sucking-stone, which was no longer there. She chose not to say anything about the missing items, thinking it would have been wiser to let him fetch her from the garden an unsuckable stone.
The missing knife was a noble knife, a vegetable knife, so-called stainless, and a safety catch, highly dangerous and potentially dangerous. It was taken from me at the police-station without my knowledge. I often throw away all I had about me in a burst of irritation. I resolved to declare loudly that the knife was missing, which resulted in me receiving a very fine vegetable knife that was stained but didn't take long to stain. The knife was stained with rust and had a dangerous safety catch which led to dangerous cuts on my fingers when I got caught between the handle of an Irish horn and the blade of a genuine Irish horn. I have the knife somewhere in my possession and intend to use it to draw up the list of my pos- sessions.
It is natural for SamuEL BECKETT to focus more on what he has lost than what he could have gained. Samuel Beckett admits that he does not always observe a principle and that it vanishes from time to time. He no longer understands what he is doing or why he does it. Nevertheless, he doesn't deny it and continues to engage in it, even though he no longer knows what he's doing and doesn't understand it. Samuel Beckett finds doing fills him with such a strong emotion that he doesn’t stop to enquire what principle he's observing. Samuel Beckett believes that whatever he does and whatever he says will always be the same thing.
The things that you don't bother with, you let go and let be, for the same reason or wisely, knowing that they don't have any value or worth to you. You don't know what you're doing or why, and you have to go on not knowing what to do. I have never been able to conceive and have never tried, which doesn't surprise me as I never tried. If I had tried, I would have known no peace until I got what I have, which is enough for me. As far as my dear little sweet little future is concerned, I have no qualms, and I have a good time coming.
Lousse was in the garden, tending a grave and sowing grass in the evening. MOLLO Y 47 saw Lousse through a window which was lit by a wild tawny light from the staircase. Lousse was taking advantage of the cool evening and gave food and drink to MOLLY Y 47 who was looking for his bicycle. MO LLO Y47 found his bicycle half buried in a soft bush and tried to get on it, but the wheels wouldn't turn, indicating that his bicycle had broken down. Eventually, he threw the bicycle back in the bush and lay down on the ground, careless of the dew, feeling most alive.
Lousse, taking advantage of my weakness, is suspected to have poisoned my beer with something intended to mollify me and Molloy. Lousse made propositions to me, which I listened to absent-mindedly, as I had nothing else to do. Eventually, from these propositions, which she enun- ciated slowly and distinctly, repeating each clause several times, she elicited the following gist: I would live in Lousse's home and live there as though it were my own. I would have plenty to eat, drink, and smoke, if I smoked, and my remaining days would glide away without a care. If I did not choose to be clean, to wear nice clones, to wash, and to
Lousse has asked Samuel BECKETT to be near her, allowing her the right to contemplate her extraordinary body both at rest and in motion. SAMUEL BECKT is not in the town where Lousse is currently located. Lousse has a strong sense of smell, and the smell of spike-lavender, a strongly scented flower, which she loves, makes me think of Lousse. L
She gathered lavender when it bloomed and made it into lavender-bags that she put in her cupboards to perfume her handkerchiefs, underclothing, and house-linen. I heard the chiming of the hours, from the clocks and belfries, which chimed out longer and longer, then suddenly briefly, and longer again. She spent a lot of time with me, squatting or kneeling beside me while I was stretched out on the grass, lying on my back, on my stomach, and on one side, now on the other. She never stopped talking and never stopped asking what town we were in. Eventually, she got up and went away and I stayed where I was, with regret, mild regret.
There was no moon, nor any other light, and it was a night of listening, a night given to the faint soughing MOLLOY 49 and sighing stirring at night in little pleasure gardens. There was a shy sabbath of leaves and petals and the air that eddies there as it does in other places, where there is less constraint and there is more vigilance. There were times when I forgot who I was, forgot to be, and was no longer that sealed jar to which I owed my well-preserved existence. Eventually, a wall gave way and I filled with roots and tame stems, stakes, and stakes long since dead and ready for burning.
I was once in a jar which knew neither seasons nor gardens. I was in a place where I could ask myself questions to keep myself from losing the thread of the dream. I willingly asked myself questions for the sake of looking at them and to believe I was still there. Perhaps that was the cause of my innocence in the jar. The jar was a bit threadbare and a little threadbare, but I was glad to have it. When I picked up his marble, I didn't have to, and I was grateful to have picked it up.
The words engraved themselves for ever on my memory, possibly because V understood them at once. 50 SAMUEL BECKETT has a sensitive ear, and sounds unencumbered with precise mean- ing are registered better by him than by most others. V has a defect of understanding that vibrates at a lower frequency or higher frequency than that of ratiocination, which he perceives as a defect due to repeated solicitations. The words I heard, and heard distinctly, were heard a first time, then a second time, and often a third time, as pure sounds, devoid of any meaning. This is one of the reasons why conversation was painful to me, and one reason why I was so untalkative.
I reacted in my own way to nature and to the works of men without seeking enlightenment. My eye was ill-connected with the spider and I found it hard to name what was mirrored there. I saw the world in a formal and inordinately formal manner, but I was not an aesthete or an artist. I misjudged the distance separating me from the other world and often mis-judged it, often misjudging the distance and reaching out for things far beyond my reach and knocking against obstacles. I was like that even when I had two eyes, but it has been long since that era of my life and my recol- lection of it is more than imperfect. My attempts at taste and smell were less fortunate, I smelt and tasted without knowing what was good or bad and rarely twice running the same thing. I would have been an excellent husband, incapable of wearying of my wife and committing adultery only from absent
I stayed with Lousse for a good while after leaving the image of old Geulincx, who left me free, on the black boat of Ulysses, to crawl towards the East, along the deck. Lousse is described as a person who has not the pioneering spirit and is not a pioneering spirit. I left Lousse after a few months or a year. I know it was warm again the day I left, but in my part of the world where the weather can be warm or cold or merely mild at any moment of the year, and where the days do not run gently up and down, the weather was much the same when I left as when I came.
I have been under the weather for a long time and have been able to distinguish between different types of weathers. I think I stayed in several different rooms, possibly one after the other. In my head there are several windows that open variously on the parading universe. The house and garden were fixed by some unknown mechanism of com- pensation and I, when I stayed still, was also fixed. When I moved, from place to place, it was very slowly, as if I were in a cage out of time and out of space. 52 SAMUEL BECKETT believes that to be out of one and not out of the other was for cleverer than him, who was not clever, but foolish.
I have a brief recollection of an event where I helped neither in the house nor the garden and knew nothing of what was going on in the garden. I preferred the garden to the house, judging by the long hours I spent there, spending the greater part of the day and night, whether it was wet or fine. I heard dull sounds, sharp ones and sharp ones, and often the roar of air being vigorously churned, which to me seemed like the sound of burning. Men were always busy working there and the garden seemed to change little from day to day apart from the cycle of birth, life and death. My bicycle had disappeared and I drifted like a dead leaf on springs.
The garden I was in was surrounded by a high wall, its top bristling with broken glass like fins. Sometimes I felt the wish to look for it again and find out what was wrong with it or go for a walk on the walks and paths connecting the different parts of the garden. However, instead of fulfilling this wish, I stayed where I was looking at it, observing it as it shrivelled up and disap- peared, like the famous fatal skin. I preferred to behave in the presence of wishes, active and contemplative, and found the latter preferred due to my temperament. The garden was protected by a wicket-gate giving free access to the road, which was never locked. I was able to open and close the wicket gate without difficulty, both by day and by night, and had seen it used by others, including others other than myself, for the purpose of
Lousse is described as a woman who lives in a house with a garden and a house, but only men, with the obvious exception of Lousse herself. Lousse rarely showed herself to me, possibly out of tact and fearing to alarm me. I suspect that Lousse spied on me, hiding behind bushes, curtains, or skulking in the shadows of a first-floor room with a spy-glass. She expressed a desire to see me, both coming and going and rooted to the spot, which suggests she had a keen interest in seeing me both from the garden and from the house. She inspected me, little by little, and even in my sleeping and getting up, the mornings that I went to bed. I remained faithful to my custom, which was to sleep in the morning, when I slept at all.
I used to sleep in a large garden, but now I sleep in the house, which is large and extremely spacious. I used to be given slow poison by a woman who gave me food and drink, but I don't know what poisons she gave me. I accuse the woman of drugged my food and drinks with noxious and insipid powders and potions. However, I would have swallowed it all down with the same whole-heartedness even if I had been drugged. I had no appetite for conversation, and I had hardly any.
 SAMUEL BECKETT usually devours with a voracity usually associated with heavy eaters, and he devoured with a method that follows from the idea of heavy eating. 54 SAMU ELIZABETT devoured a small amount of food, but devoured it with a great deal of deliberation and loathing, whereas a heavy eater would consume large amounts of food and drink heavily, such as consuming five or six mugs of beer with one swig and then not drinking for a week. 54SAMUEL ELIKKETT was under the influence of Loussc, who insinuated stimulants into his various systems, but he is unsure whether they were stimulants or depressants. 54Samuel ElIkkett felt more or less the same as usual and was terror-stricken when he was subjected to the substances, which left him feeling bereft of feeling and consciousness and drowning in a deep and merciful torpor.
I have the ability to levitate in the air and collapse like a puppet when its strings are dropped, causing me to fall and lay long where I fell, literally boneless. I am used to this phenomenon and have prepared accordingly, much like an epileptic doctor when he feels the fit coming, laying down or wedging myself where he could not be dislodged. However, I did not always take precautions to prevent the fall, preferring the fall to the trouble of having to lie down or stand fast. The falls I suffered with Loussc were less surprising to me than the levitation, as they were more in keeping with me. I have never bounded, not even as a child, and neither rage nor pain ever made me bound.
The meal was always delivered to me on a tray with a low rim and coated with red lacquer. The tray was small and made of a single dish and one slab of bread. For the little I ate, I crammed it into my mouth with my hands and drank from a bottle. The bottles I drank from the bottle were brought to me separately, in a basket. The basket made no impression on me, and I could not remember what it was like. Many times I strayed from the place where the meal was served and couldn't find it again when I felt the desire to eat, searching high and low in vain.
During his stay at Lousse, SAMUEL BECKETT's health did not get worse, and he experienced no new or significant changes, apart from those arising from the spread of existing plethoras and deficiencies, which he attributed to existing illnesses.SAMUEL believes that during his stay with Lousse no more new symptoms appeared, of a pathological nature, and there was nothing new or strange, nothing comparable to the sudden loss of half his half-poe
Lousse was described as a woman of extraor-dimensional flatness, physically speaking, with a somewhat hairy face and a deep, deep voice. Lousse's physical description of herself left Molloy wondering if she was a man or at least an androgyne, and if a woman could have stopped him as he swept towards his mother.
"I have rubbed up against a few men in my time, but I have not rubbed against a woman before. I did more than rub up against one woman, a woman named Ruth. Ruth went by the peaceful name of Ruth, possibly Edith. Ruth had a hole between her legs, not the bunghole I had always imagined, but a slit, and in this I put, or rather she put, my so-called virile member. I toiled and moiled until I discharged or gave up trying or was begged by her to stop. Ruth made me acquainted with love.""I lent myself to love with a good enough grace, knowing it was MOLLO Y 57 love."
I have seen dogs and I had seen dogs, and I was surprised when she confided that you could do things differently. I have a feeling that she put me in her rectum. I wonder if true love takes place in the rectum and if I have never known true love. She is an eminently flat woman with short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick, and she has a yellow nape. She has voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and undergar- ments whose names I forget. We met in a rubbish dump, unlike any other, and yet they are all alike, rubbish dumps.
Samuel Beckett and Edith met in a rubbish dump in a dainty flat. Edith was an idealist and had no time to lose. SamuEL BECKETT liked the flat, it was full of delicate furniture, the couch moved forward on its castors, the whole place fell about their ears, and there was chaos in the flat due to the fall of the couch. Samuel Beckett enjoyed their encounter with Edith and enjoyed the tenderness and tenderness of their time together, he cut his toe-nails and rubbed Edith's rump with winter cream. The session was of short duration and Samuel Beckett hastened Edith’s end by hastening her end in the rubbish dump.
"There are contingencies in true love. When a member searches for a rubbing-place and meets with none, and the heart does not beat in retreat but re-tains its tumefaction, true love comes to pass. When you add a little pedicure and massage, having nothing to do with the instant of bliss strictly speaking, then I feel no doubt that true love is justified.""The indifference with which I learnt of her death was softened by the pain of losing a source of revenue. She died in a warm tub, which was her custom before receiving me. The tub overturned and the dirty water spilt on top of the lodger below, who gave the alarm.""I didn't think I knew the story so well. She must have been a woman, if she hadn't been a
The fact of having found a man when they should have found a woman was initially repressed and forgotten by those unfortunate enough to know about it. Only myself knew about it and spoke about it, with the exception of myself. I have a strong intuition that the experience of finding a man was unique and perfect, of its kind, achieved and inimitable, and I sought to preserve it in my heart, even if it meant resorting to self-abuse to preserve the memory of the experience. Despite having met Lousse and even fre- quented her, the experience seems to have proved nothing to her.
I think of my mother as an old woman, widowed and withered, and of Ruth as another woman, both old and wizened. Ruth used to speak of her defunct husband's inability to satisfy her cravings for sex. Some days, like this evening, my memory confuses them and I think of them as one and the same old hag, flattened and crazed by life. I left Lousse one warm airless night without saying goodbye to my mother and without her trying to hold me back. My mother must have seen me go, get up, take my crutches and go away, springing on them through the air. She knew the way I had of going to the wicket and quickly drawing
The character 60 SAMUEL BECKETT has left her dog's grave. She has sown a garden with many many-coloured flowers and herbaceous plants, selected in such a way that when some went out others lit up. She left behind her bicycle, which she suspected to be a vehicle of some malignant agency and possibly the cause of her recent misfortunes. She did not try to stop Samuel Beckett from going back to the grave. Samuel Beckett was afraid of wearing out the small voice saying "get out of here, Molloy, take your crutches and get out of the place." Samuel BeckETT had been hearing this voice for a long time and understood it.
I went with the wind and carried my crutches, feeling it helping me. I entered the first shelter I came to and stayed there until dawn despite knowing I would be stopped by the first policeman and asked what I was doing. I did not stay in the shelter due to the presence of a man who drove me out. I think he was a nightwatchman, a man employed to watch over some kind of public works, digging or digging. There was a touch of autumn in the air and I noticed a brazier in the distance. I found myself on a flight of stairs in a mean lodging-house which had no door or door and was empty before dawn.
I have been in a town for a long time and have been there all the time. The town was waking, doors were opening and shutting and the noise was deafening. I found myself in a narrow alley between two high buildings with little windows on every floor facing one another. There was no way out of the alley, it was a blind alley with two recesses opposite each other, littered with miscellaneous rubbish and with excrements, including dog and MOLLO V 61 masters. I entered one of the alcoves and leaned against the wall, choosing to sit instead of lie down.
I was leaning against a wall and was on the verge of slipping, using only the tips of my crutches as props. Eventually, I crossed an alleyway into another chapel and settled myself in the same hypotenusal posture, feeling a little better. A fine rain was falling and I took off my hat to give my skull the benefit of it, which was cracked and furrowed and on fire. I also took off the hat because it was digging into my neck because of the thrust of the wall. I threw the hat from me with a careless gesture and it landed against my side.
I have a vegetable knife in my pocket which I used to open my wrist, but the pain caused me to give up and put it back in the pocket. I wasn't disappointed, as I had not hoped for anything better. I have a history of backsliding, which has always depressed me. I believe that life is made up of this kind of "backsliding". I wouldn't be surprised if death itself is a kind of back-sliding. There is a fine rain falling with no wind, which seems to exclude all idea of wind. My knees are enormous and I have just caught a glimpse of them when I got up for a second. My legs are as stiff as a life-sentence, yet I sometimes get up. I remember my present existence as a nursery tale, but only from time to time to recall it. SAMUEL BECKETT said, if necessary, whenever necessary, to use the knife if necessary.
I left the im-passe and set off towards the least gloomy quarter of the heaven, which is the one where a vast cloud was shrouding the sky from the zenith to the skylines, and from which rain was falling. I decided to go towards this quarter because it was the one part of the heavens that was least gloomy. The decision was made by taking a little pains, as I have done in other moments in my life when I took a lot of pains to reach a decision. I am no longer with Lousse and now I am out in the heart of pre-established harmony, which I believe makes a sweet music.
The scene takes place in a narrow, narrow doorway where a young old man is alone and shivering in the rain. Archways are visible from which many people, more courageous or less delicate, come and go, avoiding getting wet due to the weather. The old man seems to be of a different category from those who have passed through the archways. The project conceived the day of the encounter with Lousse and her dog was prevented from being carried out due to a previous encounter with her. The young man was shivering alone in the doorway when he approached the old man and stood beside him, hoping to emulate the example of one jvho who followed his example and made a speech. MOLLOY 63, the young man, decided to go out into the rain and away before making the speech. The speech was a controversial one and was liable to offend, offend at least to astonish.
I am alone in a doorway, standing alone in the doorway with no one to stand beside me. I had stolen from Lousse a little silver, massive teaspoons, and other small objects which I did not understand but which seemed to have some value. One of these small objects, a tiny sawing-horse-like cross, haunts me still. The cross resembles a sawed-off cross, but it is not perfect, consisting of two identical V's joined at their points of intersection by a bar.
 SAMUEL BECKBTT considers a strange object that stands with equal stability and stability on any one of its four possible bases, a sawing-horse, and has no obvious purpose or purpose. Samuel has never been able to understand the purpose or function of the object, but he has fond memories of gazing upon it affectionately and admiring it. SamUEL believes that the object has a specific function and is always hidden from him. Samuel believes that to know nothing is nothing, not to want to know anything, but to be beyond knowing anything, and to know you are beyond knowledge is peace to the incurious seeker.
I left the shelter of the doorway and began levering myself forward, swinging slowly through the sullen air using crutches. There is a sense of rapture in the movement of cruts, which is a series of little flights, skimming the ground, through the thronging sound of wind and limb, and through the rush of people who have to fasten one foot to the ground before they dare lift up the other. • My mind was initially occupied with my mother and the desire to know if I was near her, but it gradually became less, possibly because of the silver in my pockets and the ancient cares. • I believe that the mind needs fresh cares from time to time to bring it back from its ancient cares and revert with renewed vigour to the old ones.
I lost interest in knowing what town I was in and if I should find my mother and settle the matter between them. I had been bent on this matter all my life and had been trying to settle it for a lifetime, but had never succeeded. I felt that time was running out and that it was per-haps too late to settle the issue. I drifted towards other cares, other phantoms, and decided to leave the town. I knew that if I kept on in a straight line, I would eventually leave it.
I came to the ramparts as night was falling and described a good quarter of a circle through bad navi- gation. I stopped many times to rest due to feeling harried and harried. In the country there is another justice, other judges, at first. The sky was clearing prior to the winding in the other shroud, revealing a pale and dying sky and the sun, already down, with livid tongues of fire darting towards the zenith. This phenomenon, if I remember rightly, was characteristic of my region. I never escaped from my region and the limits of the region were unknown to me, but I felt they were far away.
I have travelled in a vast region, a region described by Molloy as vast and vast, and I have never left it. However, I have left this region many times, thinking I was still within it, but I preferred to abide by a simple feeling and its voice that said "Molloy, your region has never left and you have never shall leave it." According to this feeling, whenever I wander, within the distant 66 SAMUEL BECKETT limits, things will always be the same, precisely, day after day and vigrit after night. If regions merge into one another, and this remains to be proved, it would suggest that my movements were due to the buckled wheel that carried me, in unforeseeable jerks, from fatigue to rest, and inversely
The character has no arms and is depicted as a mother. The character's hands are not hers and are depicted playing with the sheet, possibly in a love-play manner. The characters are a couple who play with the sheets, one on top of the other, but the play doesn't last long and the hands are brought back towards her by her and she brings them towards her, as if they were resting time. She also has feet, one with toes and the other without, which she sees at the foot of the bed. Her legs, corresponding to her arms, are stiff and sore, and she can't forget them as she can her arms which are sound and well.
I didn't miss my bicycle, but I didn't mind going on my way the way I did, swinging low in the dark over the earth and along empty country roads. I thought there was little likelihood of my being molested and that it would be more likely for me to molest the gods if they saw me. MOLLOY 67 looked at it in vain, and perhaps unquestioningly, and decided to give the gods a chance by turning around to give them a chance. The morning is a time for hiding and for order, beauty and justice for those who wake up, hale and hearty, their tongues hanging out for order and justice. The time from 8 or 9 until noon is the dan- gerous time. Towards noon things quiet down and the most placable people go home, the most im- placable are sated, and there have been a few survivors but they've done a good job.
The story takes place in a place where the shadows lengthen, the walls multiply, and you hug the walls, feeling like a good boy, hiding from mere terror, looking neither right nor left, hiding but not provocatively, ready to come out, to smile, to listen, to crawl, less rat-like than toad, less pestilent than a toad and less dangerous than a rat. The night is perilous but sweet to those who know it, who can open to it like a flower to the sun, and compared to the day there is much to be said for the night. The purge of the night is in the hands of tech- nicians and the bulk of the population have no part in it, preferring their warm beds. The day is the time for lynching, especially during the morning, between breakfast and lunch.
"There is no mercy for the monster on the move or on the watch, lurking in his lair or in his sleep. However, the monster can sometimes benefit from milder feelings, such as gentleness and gentleness, which deflect the barrel of a lethal weapon. The hunter is weak at heart and senti- mental, overflowing with repressed treasures of gentility and com- passion. Many a foul beast, and worthy of extermination, can live on in the peace and quiet of zoological gar dens, broken only by the innocent laughter, the knowiife laughter of children and 68 SAMUEL BECKETT their elders, on Sundays and Bank Holidays.""I have always preferred slavery to death, and I have never been able to conceive of being put to death to my satisfaction.""My notions on death inspired me with confidence and I felt entitled to act on them in certain emergencies."
I have a tendency not to rush into things, preferring to slow down and wait for events to unfold. Therefore, when I forgot myself to the point of trying, I crawled into a hole and waited, half sleeping, half sighing, groaning and laughing, and half feeling my body to see if anything had changed. Then I resumed my spirals and did not know what became of me in the months and possibly the years that followed. I spent some time at the seaside without incident. Personally, I feel no worse there than anywhere else. My life has ebbed away before this shivering expanse, to the sound of the waves and claws of the surf.
I have always believed that my land ended at the coast and not at the sea. I once went to the sea in a sort of oarless skiff, paddling with an old bit of driftwood, and I sometimes wonder if I ever came back from that voyage. I took advantage of being at the seaside to lay in a store of sucking-stones, pebbles, which I call stones, and distributed them equally between my four pockets and sucked them to solve a problem.
I have a greatcoat and a pocket in which I can store stones. I have four pockets, each containing four stones. When I suck, I replace a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat with one from the left pocket of the trousers, which I replace by another stone from that pocket, and so on until there are only four stones in each pocket. When the desire to suck takes hold of me again, I draw again on the "right pocket" of the greatcoat to ensure that I don't take the same stone as the previous time. I rearranged the stones in the pocket by replacing them with the stone which was in my mouth after I had finished sucking. However, this solution does not satisfy me fully as the four stones circulating in the pockets are not always the same four.
The initial method of transferring the stones was to take the three remaining stones from the right jJocket of my greatcoat and replace them by the four remaining in the right pocket of my trousers. 70 SAMUEL BECKETT replaced them with the four in the left pocket of his trousers, the four from his greatcoat's left pocket, and the three from his right pocket after he had finished sucking. However, this method was not enough to satisfy a man like me, and I began looking for something else.
If I was certain of finding, in the right pocket of my greatcoat, four different stones, there was a risk of always finding the same stone within each group of four. Therefore, even if I increased the number of pockets, I would always end up with the same four stones, always the same, turn and turn about, and not the sixteen turns and turns about as I planned. Even if I had eight pockets instead of the four I currently have, it would have been possible for me to suck at least eight of the sixteen stones, which would have increased my chances of enjoying my stones until their number was exhausted.
T has a pocket capacity to double the number of her pockets, but it is not possible to quadruple them by dividing each pocket in two with the help of safety-pins. T has difficulty in sitting on the ground because of her stiff leg and her stiffening leg. T's good leg, good in the sense that it was not stiff, began to stiffen and she needed a prop under the ham and even under the whole length of the leg to support her. T was beginning to lose all sense of measure after all the wrestling and wrangling and decided to make it "all or nothing" in terms of her pocket capacity. She was sitting on MOLLOY 71 shore, before the sea, when the sixteen stones spread out before her eyes.
The story takes place in a world where stones are revolving interminable martingales, crushing Handfuls of sand, and the sand runs through my fingers and falls back on the strand. earth. Eventually, it dawned on me that I could achieve my purpose without increasing the number of pockets or stones, but only by sacrificing the principle of trim. The meaning of the word trim, which I had never met before, became apparent to me, but it remained obscure to me until I understood that it could only mean the distribution of the sixteen stones in four groups of four, one group in each pocket. My refusal to consider any other distribution other than this resulted in the problem being solvable and rendered the problem literally in- soluble.
I have found a solution to a problem that is not only sound but elegant. I believe that other solutions to this problem might have been found, and that had I been more insistent, more resistant, I could have found them myself. However, I was tired and contrived to come up with the first solution that was a solution, and I cont nted myself ingloriously with the initial solution. The solution I found was to put six stones in the right pocket of my great-72 SAMUEL BECKETT coat, or supply-pocket, five in the left pocket of his trousers, and five in his trousers.
The game involves sucking a stone from the right pocket of a greatcoat and putting it in the left pocket of the greatcoat, which is the one that is empty (of stones). Then, after sucking the stone, she takes a second stone and puts it in her left pocket. Eventually, she transfers the six stones she sucked to the left side pocket of her greatcoat. Once the two pockets are empty, she replaces them with the stones in the right pockets of her trousers and leaves the left one empty.
In the MOLLOY 73 series, I sucked five stones and transferred them to the left pocket of my greatcoat. When the right pocket of the greatcoat was empty (of stones), I transferred the five remaining stones to the same redistribution as a moment before, which is to say transferring them to a different pocket. In this redistribution, I replaced the five stones in the right pockets of my trousers with the five in the left one, and then transferred them back to the right one. After the redistribution of the stones, I replace the six stones in my left pocket with the six in my trousers, which I replace by the five from the left.
I sucked stones in the same order as the first time, which meant that the first, seventh, twelfth and twelfth respec- tively of the first cycle might not be the sixth, eleventh, and sixteenth of the second, depending on the worst case scenario. However, this was a drawback that I could not avoid. I preferred to make the best of the comparative peace of mind I enjoyed within each cycle taken separately, even if it meant having to remember the number of stones in my mouth and look for them in my pocket.
Samuel Beckett's solution to the puzzle is imperfect, but he is pleased at having found it all alone. 74 SAMUEL BECKETT considers his solution to be the only perfect solution, and he believes it would have been the sixteen pockets, sym- metrically disposed, each one with its stone. 75 Samuel Beckett believes that his solution would have freed him from anxiety within each cycle and for the sum of all the cycles, which he considers to go on forever. 74 Samuel Beckett finds the uneven distribution of the stones in the puzzle to be painful and inelegant, as indicated by his dissatisfaction with the unevenness of the distribution.
There was a kind of equilibrium in the early stages of each cycle, after the third suck and before the fourth suck, but it did not last long and I felt the weight of the stones dragging me around, dragging me to one side or the other, as if I were being dragged by them. I think that the need to suck the stones was more than a principle I abandoned, it was a bodily need. However, I didn't give a fiddler's curse about being dragged to the right hand and the left, backwards and forwards by the stones, and deep down it was all the same to me whether I sucked a different stone each time or always the same stone, for they all tasted the same. If I had collected sixteen stones, I collected them to have a little store, not to ballast myself, but to ensure that I would never be without.
The character MOLLOY 75 is a black speck in a vast stretch of sand, located in a wild part of the coast. She has lost or thrown away all the stones but one, which she kept in one pocket, now in another pocket, and which she lost or threw away. She doesn't remember having been seriously molested. Some people, including old women and young ones, came to gather wood and stare at her, but they all knew what she was and kept their distance. One of them offered her something to eat and she looked at her in silence, until she went away.
I see a young woman coming towards me and stopping from time to time to look back at her companions, who are huddled together like sheep, watching her recede and laughing. I seem to hear laughter from far away. As the young woman goes towards me, she looks back without stopping and doesn't look away from me. I see two women, one shyly approaching me and the other going away, unhesitatingly. For those who came towards me from the seaside, I saw them from afar, most of the time. I could follow all their manoeuvres and could follow their movements closely. I often turned towards the land, and my sight was better at the seasides due to my good eye.
SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who lives in a cave and feels reasonably secure from the elements and mankind, but he believes there is a price to pay. 76 SAMUEL believes that in caves and in vour box, there are prices to pay, which one willingly pays willingly for a time, but which one can't go on paying forever, for one cannot buy the same thing forever with one's little pittance. 76 Samuel has memories of his town being not strictly speaking on the sea, but inland due to a kind of swamp which exists between his town and the sea. 76 Samuel's memories have their roots deep in the immediate past, with talk of draining, by means of canals, or transforming into a vast port and docks, or turning into a city on piles for the workers,
The city of Watt is situated in a swamp, a place where an incalculable number of human lives are annually engulfed by a vast amount of water, leading to a significant number of deaths each year. The Public Works Department has begun to work in certain areas despite adversity, setbacks, epidemics, and the apathy of the public works department. However, the idea of pro- claiming that the sea came lapping at the ramparts of my town is a far cry from the truth and I will not lend myself to such a perversion of the truth until I feel compelled or find it convenient to do so. I knew this swamp a little, having risked my life in it, cautiously, and at a period of my life when I was richer in illusions, richer in certain illusions, and poorer in illusions. There is no direct access to my town by sea, so one has to disembark well to the north or the south and take to the roads.
My progress has been slow and pain- ful because of a short, stiff leg, which is growing stiffer and shorter every day. My other leg, supple previously and now growing rapidly stiff, is also getting shorter, but not yet getting shorter. When the two legs shorten at the same time, and at different speeds, it is a nuisance and a nuisance for me. I didn't know which foot to land on when I came down due to the increasing discomfort of the stiff leg. The stiff leg hurt me more than the old stiff leg because it was the other MOLLO Y 77 which I normally used as a pivot, or prop.
The old pain and the new pain are of the same family, but they are of different families. For the old pain, I had got used to it and was able to reduce its sufferings by using the former exclusively with the help of crutches. The new pain is of a different family, and I had not had time to adjust to it yet. The old pain had one bad leg and another more or less good one, which I had been able to nurse and reduce to the minimum, to the maximum, using only the former, but now I no longer have this resource. The difference between the two injuries is that the old and new ones are now equally bad, and the one that had previously been good, at least comparatively good, but has changed for the worse. JThe old leg is still extremely sensitive, but less so than the new one.
I have a short and stiffened leg, one of which is shortening and the other one which is not. The one of the short ones is so far behind the other that it is the worse of the two arJ and the one in need of nursing. If I could have bent it to make it seem as short as the other arJ, I would have been able to land on the short one before taking off again, but I couldn't do it due to the stiffness of the first arJ. Sometimes I have managed to lengthen my short leg by chance on a road or by taking advantage of a not too deep ditch or other breach of surface. The short leg has not done any work for so long that it doesn't know how to go about it.
I was using crutches, one short and one long, to walk due to a disability. tot and another factor of disequilibrium was involved when I made the best of the lie of the land. tot I went along little forest paths where differences of level were too confused and erratic to be of any help to me. tot My disability was caused by a constant and monotonous increase of pain caused by work and the decrease of pain dispensed by work. tot Despite this, my progress suffered from this state of affairs and had to stop more and more often due to frequent halts due to the pain.
I am in a place of deep darkness, in towering forests and giant fronds, where I hobble and listen, listen, fall, rise, listen and hobble, wondering sometimes if I will ever see again the hated light, at least unloved, stretched palely between the last boles. I consider hanging myself from a bough, with a liane, in order to end my story. I have struggled with the thought of suicide for a long time, but I have always overcome the temptation to do so.
I have asthma, which has led to frequent thoughts of cutting my throat and turning purple. My asthma attacks occur mostly at night, and I can't decide which one is worse. However, I never succumbed to the temptation to cut my throat due to the noise of the asthma attacks. I wrapped my head in a coat to stifle the obscene noise of choking and I dis- guised it as a fit of coughing, which is universally accepted and approved. My progress was slowed down by the defection of my good leg and I was growing weaker and weaker due to this defect.
I have been at the seaside for a long time and have been experiencing increasing weakness. My weakness has increased significantly, to the point where I can't believe it is the same hole. The hole, referred to as the "arse-hole", has become a symbol of those passed over in silence and is seen by me as a link between me and other excrement. I believe that the arse hole is the portal of our being and the celebrated 80 SAMUEL BECKETT mouth. I find it to be an eyesore and a distinc- tion due to its centrality and its air of being linked to the other. Almost everything comes from without and what comes from within is not welcomed warmly.
I have a tendency to overlook fundamentals and think I have nothing to learn, and I often confuse them with accidentals. My legs developed normally at the seaside and I had noticed nothing abnormal in them. I had hardly left the shore and was absorbed in the metamorphosis of my excellent leg when they suddenly began to gallop and became weak, turning their weakness into the weakness of death. I fix the desertion of my toes as the reason for this sudden change in their strength. I thought my toes were in excellent fettle, apart from a few corns, bunions, ingrowing nails, and tendency to
The cramp is not the weak point of my health. No, my true weak points are else-where. My health is at the very top of an impressive robustness, which I attribute to moral qualities, hygienic habits, fresh air, lack of sleep, solitude, persecution, and long silent screams (dangerous to scream) and a daily longing for MOLLO Y 81. Santa Maria is my word of honour and I can't piss. Mammy, who gave me a nice dose of her unconquerable genes, was the source of my boils.
I have a prepuce, sat verbum, oozes urine, I think it's urine, and it smells of kidney. I think I have lost the sense of smell. My sweat and dribble has a strange smell and I think urine is in my dribble as well. I have a fear of uremia and fear that it will finish me off, and I fear that if it ever dawns, I will be less afraid of being finished than I am today. I do not feel at the beginning of my career and I have not the presumption to think I am near the end, so I husband my strength for the spurt. I wait, jogging along, for the bell to say "one last effort, it's the end".
I have a feeling that the day will come for me to announce what is left of all I had, but I have to wait to be sure there is nothing more I can acquire, or lose, or throw away, or give away before I can do so. 82 SAMUEL BECKETT expresses a sense of uncertainty about the future of her possessions. She can't make sense of this 82 SAMUSEL BERTETT presentiment. She believes that the best presentiments are true and can be borne out, but she believes that all false presentiments can be reduced to notions clear and distinct, distinct from all other notions. She was not given to presentiments, but to sentiments sweet and simple, to episentiments rather.
I knew only in advance, and when the time came for me to make a superhuman effort, I no longer knew what I was doing. I regained my ignorance when it was past. My progress is becoming more and more slow and painful due to innumerable so-called weak points, not solely due to my legs. I have laid too much stress on my legs during these wanderings, to the detriment of the rest. I was not an ordin- ary cripple, and there were days when my legs were the best part of me, with the exception of the brain capable of forming such a complex thought.
MoLLO Y 83 was forced to stop frequently to dislodge clots and to lie down, in defiance of the rules, prone, supine, now on one side, and as much as possible with the feet higher than the head, in order to remove the clots. The forest was all about her and the boughs were twining together at a prodigious height, compared to her own height. MOLLY Y 83 sheltered herself from the light and the elements, some days she advanced no more than thirty or forty paces, and others she walked in impenetrable darkness. The darkness was sufficient for her visual needs, but there was a kind of blue gloom, which she saw as blue due to the red of the sun and green of the leaves.
Bui often finds herself at a crossroads or crossroads in unexplored forests and describes a complete circle or less than a circle, or more than one circle, with a resemblance between them. Bui doesn't like gloom to lighten and prefers it to be dark, as indicated by her dislike of shadows and shadows. She encounters a char-coal-burner in the forest, a character who she might have loved if she had been seventy years younger, but it's not certain if she would have loved him as he too would have been younger by as much, if he had been younger, possibly much younger. She never really had much love to spare, but she had her little quota of love for old men when she was small and it went to the old men, when it could. She did love one or two old women, but nothing like the old woman, whose name she has lost.
The stranger is a total stranger who was born in a forest and has spent his whole life in the forest. He is sick with solitude. He has a charcoal-burner, which is something that never escapes him. The stranger has been living in the same forest for a long time and was born there. When he asked for directions to the nearest town, he found the necessary words 84 SAMUEL BECKETT and accents, but he did not know how to get out of the forest due to his extensive knowledge of it. He held me back by the sleeve, but I freed a crutch and dealt him a good dint on the skull, which calmed him.
I started to examine him and gave him a few warm kicks in the ribs with my heels. I carefully chose the most favourable position, a few paces away from the body, with my back turned to it, and began to swing, backwards, forwards, feet pressed together, legs pressed together. I found it difficult to press my feet and legs together due to the state of my legs. I decided to swing in an ever-widening arc and launched myself forward with all my strength, launching myself backward, which resulted in a fall. The shock from the fall knocked me down.
I have a mania for symmetry and have always had a preference for symmetry. However, one of my heels sank in something soft. I rested a moment, then got up, picked up my crutches, and applied myself with method to the exercise. If I had missed the ribs and landed in the kidney, I would have landed in a kidney, but not hard enough to burst it. People often assume that old, poor, crippled, and terrified people can’t stand up for themselves due to their perceived weaknesses. I believe that given favourable conditions, such as being a feeble and awk- MOLLOY 85 ward assailant, in one's own class and in a lonely place, one has a good chance to show what stuff you are made of. I have delayed writing this article to revive interest in the possibility of such an incident. I did eat, from time to time, roots, berries, sometimes a little mulberry, a mushroom, and carobs, which I found in forests.
I read somewhere that when a man in a forest thinks he is going forward in a straight line, he is actually going in a circle. Therefore, I did my best to go around a circle in order to avoid the forest. I found that by doing this, I stopped being half-witted and became sly, and my head became a store-house of useful knowledge. Even if I did not go in a rigorously straight line in the forest, I at least avoided a circle, and I looked forward to getting out of it. My region is not all forest, it includes plains, mountains, sea, and towns and villages connected by highways and byways. I have already escaped from the forest more than once.
The forest is described by SAMUEL BECKETT as not as bad as one might imagine it to be, and he considers it not worse than other places in his region. 86 SAMU ELIZABETT is aware of the possibility of seeing the light tremble through the still boughs, the strange light of the plain, and the bronze-still bough-like light from the forest, which he describes as a place where no breath ever stirred. 86 Samuel Beckett considers the forest to be a place neither worse nor better than the other places he has been in, and considers it better for being in the forest and being free to stay there, not because of what it was, but because he was there. 86SAMUEL BecketT considers the state of his legs and his body to be not to be despised, and that he was not forced to go to the forest due to his condition.
I could have stayed in the forest, physically speaking, but I felt I lacked something. I had the impression of committing a sin if I had stayed there, of going against an imperative. I have always been inclined to submit to imperatives, even though they have led me to places where they never led me anywhere and tore me away from places where all was no worse, leaving me stranded. I knew my imperatives well and submitted to them because they had become a habit. My imperatives were related to my relations with my mother and the importance of bringing as soon as possible some light to bear on these issues.
The imperatives were explicit and detailed until they faltered and then went silent, leaving me feeling like a fool who doesn't know where he is going or why he is there. The imperatives bore the same painful and thorny question and were all related to the same issue. MOLLOY 87 noticed something new in the Latin command that led to the faltering imperatives. Nimis sero, I think that’s Latin. The command to leave the forest without delay was not different from the ones I was used to, but it had a different framing.
I have been going to my mother for most of my life with the purpose of establishing our relations on a less precarious footing. When I was with her, I often left her without doing anything, but when I was no longer with her I was on my way to her again, hoping to do better the next time. However, when I appeared to give up and to busy herself with something else, I was actually planning and seeking the way to the house of my mother. Even without this so-called imperative I impugn, it would have been difficult for me to stay in the forest because I was forced to assume my mother was not there. I know that in a little while I won't be able to move and will have to stay, where I happen to be, unless someone comes and carries me.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where a character named SAMUEL BECKETT is in possession of a consciousness and hears a voice saying, far away inside her, Molloy, and then a line phrase more or less clear and simple. Sc. Beckett is compelled to attribute to others intelligible words or hear her own voice uttering to others. However, in reality, she did not say what she would have said if she had been able to, but she heard a murmur in the silence and pricked up her ears, like an animal which gives a start and pretends to be dead. She expresses her consciousness by saying, "I said, etc." or "Don’t do it."
The conversation takes place in a setting where I am stuck and unable to move due to a lack of movement. I have to stay where I happen to be and rely on some kind person to carry me, as the marches get shorter and shorter and the halts get more frequent and prolonged. The sergeant suggests that I might have expressed my feelings better if I had gone to the trouble to express them.
It was winter and many trees had lost their leaves in the forest. The leaves had turned black and spongy and sank into my crutches, making it difficult for me to get out. The gloom from the black boughs of the trees slowed me down and made it more difficult to move. I remember thinking about crawling due to the state of her legs, trunk, and head, but decided against it.
I had been looking forward to the celebrated murmurs in the forest and was surprised to hear a distant gong. murmurs were in vain, as I could hear nothing of the kind. The gong was a gong, not a tom-tom, which would not have shocked me. I was mortified to have been expecting the murmurs and to hear the gong instead. My heart does not beat and I rely on hydraulics for the squelch that an old pump makes. I listened to the leaves before their fall, but they made no sound, they were motionless and rigid, like brass. I blew my horn through the cloth in my pocket, but its hoot was fainter every time. I had taken it off my bicycle, but I don't know when. I plunged my crutches into the undergrowth, using them like grapnels, and when I felt they had a hold, I pulled myself forward using them.
In 90 SAMUEL BECKETT's mode of loco-motion, which involves crawling, crawling on his belly, and using hooks, he is able to move with ease despite having a chronic arthritis in his wrists. The advantage of this mode of movement is that it allows him to rest when he wants to, without needing to stop and rest, unlike other movements that have worn him out. In this mode, he has the ability to cover a distance of fifteen paces in a forest without killing himself, and he has even crawled on his back, plunging his crutches blindly behind him into thickets and with the black boughs for sky to view.
I lost my hat due to a fit of temper and banged it down on my skull with such violence that I couldn't get it off again. My hat had broken long ago and the lace had long since broken. If I had met any lady friends, I would not have been able to salute them correctly due to the damage caused by the broken lace. Nevertheless, I was able to maintain a steady course, turning every three or four jerks to alter course, which allowed me to describe a circle or a great polygon, and hope that I was going forward in a straight line towards my mother. Eventually, the forest ended in a ditch and I saw the light, the light of the plain, exactly as I had foreseen.
My eyes opened when I fell into a ditch, which opened my eyes. I was looking at a vast, rolling plain with nothing more than a few towers and steeples of a town, which I could not assume to be mine. The town was not familiar to me, but in my region all MOLLOY 91 plains look alike and when you know one, you know them all. I thought about going to my mother's door to see if help was coming. Fortunately for me, I heard a voice telling me not to fret, that help would come.

Molloy had not heard a bird for a long time and had not seen any birds in the forest nor at the seaside. marble had a memory of birds, skylarks, corn-crakes, two travellers who had a club, sheep, and other scenes of his life. marble saw the sheep for the first time in a while and longed to go back into the forest. marble has a son who is sleeping. marble's son is sleeping and he has trimmed his lamp, which will last until morning. marble hears an eagle-owl's battle-cry and is disturbed by it. marble is calm and
Jacques, also known as Moran, has a son named Jacques. Jacques, like his father, is unaware of the importance of his work and believes he is on the threshold of life, of real life. Jacques's father, also named Jacques, is unable to sleep and will get up and go to his desk to work on his report. Jacques believes he will be forgotten and his report will be long. Jacques is known by the name Moran, Jacques, and considers himself done for. Jacques and his son are both aware of each other's names. Jacques has always loved doing and has a fondness for it. Jacques was asked to see about Molloy on a Sunday in summer, which was a Sunday.
During the weekdays, I would have rested if I could afford it. However, seeing something done which I could have done better myself, and which I did do better whenever I put my mind to it, gave me a sense of accomplishment and joy which I rarely indulged during the week. The weather was fine. I watched absently the coming and going of my bees. I heard my son scampering down the gravel, caught up in some fantasy of flight and pursuit. I called to him not to dirty himself, but he did not answer. I inhaled the scent of my lemon-verbena. From my neighbours' chimneys, smoke rose straight and blue, and I could hear the sounds of mallet and ball, a rake on pebbles, a distant lawn-mower, and birds of course,
A man named SAMUEL BECKETT visited my house on a Sunday to pay his respects. He was not a neighbor and their business dealings were strictly of a business nature. He visited from afar to disturb me. He came directly to where I was sitting, under my Beauty of Bath. I thought I was hidden from anybody coming into my grounds and following the short path which led from the garden-gate to the front door, but was surprised when he slammed the gate and was confronted by a high mass. Samuel Beckett was dressed in his heavy, sombre Sunday best and was dressed for the weather. Samuel BecketT stopped in front of me and we stared at each other in silence, expressing his displeasure.
My son was spying on us from behind a bush. My son was about 13 or 14 years old and was big and strong for his age, but his intelligence seemed to be a little short of average. I had a profession of peeping and prying and it was part of my profession. I called him and ordered him to fetch some beer and he returned with two glasses and a quart bottle of beer. He uncorked the bottle and served it to us. I told him to wash himself, straighten his clothes, and to get ready to appear in public for the last mass. Gaber didn't wish his son to stay, but she did not wish him to stay.
Jacques went away grumb- ling with his finger in his mouth, which is considered a detestable and unhygienic habit, but preferable to the finger in the nose. Jacques was instructed by Gaber to read instructions from a notebook and leave his finger as a marker. Gaber told Jacques that the job did not interest him and suggested that the chief should call on another agent. Jacques told Gaber that no one could do the job but him and that he wants it to be him, implying that he has confidence in no one but Gaber. Jacques had been made to get up in the middle of the night just as he was getting into position to make love to his wife by their employer.
Gaber and Gaber are agents who are involved in a conversation about a man named Jacques. Gaber believes that Jacques doesn't know what he says and doesn't understand what he does. Jacques has left with his son, who Gaber thinks is out of his mind, to go to a private communion offered by Father Ambrose during the course of the afternoon. Jacques went to mass without Gaber, who was in a conference and was unaware of Jacques' departure until it was too late for mass.
The monologue 96 SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that Samuel Beckett's son might not have attended mass because he was afraid of disturbing or being reprimanded by his mother. Samuels Beckett has a history of reprimanding her son, who is a little afraid of her. Samuel Beckett feels that she has never been sufficiently chastened and has been spoiled and neglected, which has left her with bad habits ingrained beyond remedy. Samantha Beckett hopes to spare her son this misfortune by giving him a good clout from time to time and explains her reasons for doing so. Samus Beckett is concerned about the possibility of her son not returning to mass if he has not attended and decides to seek the verger, Father Ambrose, for help in finding out why.
The verger has a list of the faithful and keeps a register of them from his place beside the font. The verger ticked us off when it came to the absolution process. Father Ambrose was unaware of these activities and would have sent the verger flying if he suspected him of such a work of supererogation. I knew only what went on at the mass and had no experience of the other offices, as I never went within a mile of them. I had heard it said that these activities could have been the result of a super-vision, at the hands of the Verger himself or, when his duties called him elsewhere, of one of his sons. I was waiting for my son to come back and Gaber, whom I had not yet heard leave.
I was surprised by the light-mindedness of MOLLOY 97's reaction to Gaber's report. I had not yet begun to take the matter seriously and was trying to gain a few more moments of peace in order to avoid giving her mind to it. The chief's insistence on having me, me Moran, rather than anybody else, should have alerted me to the serious nature of the affair. Instead, Moran was distracted by thoughts of his breed's infirmities and the singularities of those around him, and he was dreaming about his own experiences. The poison was already acting on him, the poison I had just been given. The world was changing, the colour and weight of the world were changing, and the lager he had just consumed made him anxious.
Martha is in a bad mood and hasn't seen Jacques, who is not back yet. Jacques is a man who usually comes for a glass of beer, according to Martha. The man who came for a beer was not for anything, and no one came for anything else. I decided to drink peppermints on my way to the presbytery. I am naturally a heavy eater and have a fondness for heavy meals, particularly on Sunday midday meals. I will not eat lunch today. 98 SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that Martha can have the whole day off for the day, and suggests he leaves her alone for the entire day.
Gaber had gone without his beer because he wanted it badly. Jacques, a neighbour, knew Gaber's habits and was aware of his Sunday habits. Jacques had been to church alone. Jacques came back from church with no trace of frolic. Gaber asked Jacques questions about the march of the ceremony and his answers were plausible. Jacques told Gaber to wash his hands and sit down to his lunch and went back to the kitchen where he made Irish stew. The stew was served to Gaber and his concubine, who wept.
I am a punctual person who values punctuality and enjoys it. I went up to my room and made a first attempt to grasp the Molloy affair. My concern at first was only with its immediate vexations and the preparations they demanded of me. I felt a great confusion about whether or not to set out on my autocycle. I have a methodical mind and has always sought prolonged reflection before embarking on a mission to ensure the best way of setting out. Some-times I take the train, sometimes the MOLLOY 99 motor-coach, and sometimes I leave on foot, or on my bicycle, in the night.
In the present case, I was tackling the problem of transport with no preparation other than Gaber's report and a languid cognizance of this report. I liked leaving on an autocycle and was partial to this way of getting about. I had not yet bothered to read Gaber’s report and had avoided doing so because he had dismissed the Molloy affair as banal. I decided to leave on the autocyCLE despite the weather being deteriorating and the possibility of rain. The decision to leave was based on the "fatal pleasure principle" and I was unaware of the reasons against it. The sun shone through the rift in the curtains and made visible the sabbath of the motes.
My son burst into the room and asked if he could go out. I was initially surprised by his request, but I managed to control myself. My son suggested to go to the Elms, a place they call their little public park, but there was not an elm to be seen in it. I have 100 SAMUEL BECKETT been told by my son and asked him to go over his botany. I suspected my son of deceit, as he knew far more about botany than I. Personally, I liked plants and saw them as evidence of innocence and simplicity, and at times as a superfetatory proof of the existence of God. I told my son to be back at half-past four and he agreed to talk to me.
The servant showed me to the presbytery where Father Ambrose was sleeping. Father Ambrose offered me a cigar, which I accepted and put in my pocket between my fountain-pen and my propel-pencil. I asked Father Ambrose if he had noticed my son at the last mass and he confirmed that he had, and that they had spoken to each other at the front row during the mass. He feared that Jacques might be ill and called for a dear child who reassured him. Jacques explained to Father Ambrose that Jacques was a most untimely visitor, a visitor whom he could not shake off in time. He offered Father Ambrose a glass of something to drink.
I asked MOLLOY 101 for a favour and asked him to observe me observing him observing each other. I mentioned that Sunday for me without the Body and Blood is like a Sunday without the body and blood. He raised his hand and asked me not to make profane comparisons, suggesting he was thinking of the kiss without a moustache or beef without mustard. I dislike being interrupted and asked the Lord for guidance, but without result, I asked him for guidance. MOLLY 101 suggested that a wink is as good as a nod and asked if I want communion. I bowed my head and asked for guidance from the Lord, asking for guidance without result. He mentioned that he was given to prolonged fasts by way of mortification and also because his doctor advised it.
The priest, Father Ambrose, came back with a portable pyx, opened it, and gave the sacrament to me without hesitation. He informed me that Mrs Clement, the chemist’s wife and herself a highly qualified chemist, had fallen from the top of a ladder and broken her neck in her laboratory, breaking her femur.
Samuel Beckett and I are concerned about their hens, particularly their grey hen who has not laid for a month and has been doing nothing but sitting with her arse in the dust from morning to night. Samuel Beckett believes it is a joy to laugh, from time to time, which he finds peculiar to man. He believes that animals never laugh and that it takes them to find that funny. Samuel Becket has tried bicarbonate of soda to feed his hen, but she doesn't seem to like it and he advises not to use it.
I had an interview with Father Ambrose, who proposed to have her swallow dessertspoonfuls of a dessert-like substance several times a day for a few months. I declined his proposal because the chemist was closed and I had forgotten about it. The interview left me with a painful impression and I felt like one who has swallowed a pain-killer, feeling like a person who is first astonished and indignant after swallowing it. Father Ambrose was still the same dear man, but I was surprised by his lack of nobility and perceived a lack of honor. I returned home in the pouring rain after the interview feeling heavy on my stomach. Martha made a stew, but the onions were missing from the pot, which disappointed me.
I was in a state of distress, unable to understand what was happening to me and unable to under- MOLLO Y 103. She watched me mockingly as I went up to my room and drew back the curtains on a calamitous sky. I rummaged in the bin looking for something, but found nothing. My life was running out and I felt as if I were running out. I was in the middle of dozing off when her son entered her room without knocking. I abhor the idea of someone coming into her room, without knocking, without being invited, and I was masturbating before her cheval-glass. I told him to be there at half- past four, and he protested that he had not knocked twice. I reminded him about the proprieties of punctuality and decorum, and told him about something more important in life than punctuality.
My son has a special way of saying "papa" which he uses when he wants to hurt me. My son and I are going on a journey this evening. I gave him instructions to put on his school suit, the green one, but he insisted on wearing the blue one. I also gave him a knapsack containing his birthday gifts, toilet things, one shirt, one pair of socks, seven pairs of drawers, and two pairs of shoes. He asked for specific instructions on which shirt to wear and which shoes to wear.
Samuel has an appointment with Mr 104 SAMUEL BECKETT Py for a tooth extraction scheduled for the following day. Sam has an ache and is seeking help from a dentist. Sam is not the only dentist in the northern hemisphere, according to Mr Py, who considers himself a very good one. Sam was born with very bad teeth and has been born with them all his life. Py has a history of treating people with bad teeth, and he believes that Sam will have bad teeth for the rest of his life due to his naturally bad teeth. Sam's father is down to his incisors and nippers.
My son was examining the inside of his mouth with a small glass and was prising away his upper lip with his finger. MOLLOY 105 My son had drawn a glass from his pocket and was examining his mouth. I asked him to go to the window and check if it was still raining, which it was, and he informed me that the sky was overcast and there was no rift in the sky. I advised him to draw the curtains and asked him if he was waiting for his stamps, which he had two albums, a big one for his collection properly speaking and a small one for duplicates, and I had authorised him to bring the latter. I felt superior to my son and felt remorse for having begotten him. If I had been my son, I would have left him long ago.
Martha and I are having dinner at home. I had not yet told her we were leaving. I made two mistakes in not informing her about our departure. The first was leaving her in the dark and the second was not enjoining my son to keep what I had told him to himself. I was floundering due to self-doubt and self-loathing.
The Eisner sisters were not bad neighbours, but they made too much music, which annoyed Samuel Beckett. SamuEL BECKETT tried to mend matters by saying that he would be home a little later than usual and not before nine. Samuel Beckett knew that Hannah, the old cook, would call Hannah and they would whisper together for a long time through the railings. Hannah never went out, she did not like going out, and she didn't like Hannah's dislike of going out. SAMUEL Beckett has an aberdeen named Zulu, who was called "Little Zulu" by people.
I don't like men and I don't particularly like animals. God is beginning to disgust me. I have a strange aversion to God and I find him distasteful. I used to stroke his ears, through the railings, and utter wheedling words, which disgusted him. He reared up on his hind legs and pressed his chest against the bars, his penis ending in a thin wisp of wet hair. He felt insecure, his hams trembled, and his little paws fumbled for purchase. Perhaps I disgusted him too. I found it hard to tear myself away from these vain thoughts. I had accepted a commission and had given my word, but it was justified by the state of the moon. I decided to wait until the very last moment, a little before midnight, to leave the city.
Gaber was a messenger who was entitled to a notebook due to his role as an agent. Gaber was protected by a code incomprehensible to all but himself, which required him to submit his code to MOLLOY 107, the directorate, before being appointed as a messenger.Gaber understood nothing about the messages he carried and came to extravagant false conclusions about them, his memory was so bad that his messages had no existence in his head, only in his notebook.
Gaber was able to reflect on his messages and draw conclusions from them without losing a second and without losing any of his memories, including the text and gloss. I have often wondered if the messengers were compelled to undergo a surgical operation to induce such a degree of amnesia, but Gaber believes otherwise their memory was good enough. Gaber spoke about his childhood, his family, and his childhood in extremely plausible terms. To be undecipherable to all but one-self, dead without knowing the meaning of one's instructions, and unable to remember more than a few seconds, these are capacities rarely shared in the same individual. The highly esteemed messengers received a weekly wage of eight pounds as opposed to the agents' six pounds ten.
I have never seen any other messenger other than Gaber nor any other agent than myself. Gaber and I are the only ones of our kind. Therefore, it seems natural to me that each agent has his own particular messenger and to Gaber that each individual agent has their own particu- lar agent. I expressed my desire for Gaber to give the job to someone else and Gaber was able to reply that SAMUEL BECKETT wants it to be you. I suspect that Gaber's last words were uttered by the chief with the sole purpose of fostering an illusion of being the only agents in the group.
I was living a wretched existence at six pounds ten a week plus bonuses and expenses. I had made away with Gaber and the chief (one Youdi) and considered myself responsible for my wretched existence. I was not made for the great light that devours and had only a dim lamp for light and patience to shine it on empty shadows. I went down to the kitchen to find Martha, who was sitting in her rocking-chair in the chimney-corner, rocking herself moodily. Martha's rocking chair was her only possession and she would not have parted with it for an empire. Martha installed the rocking chair in the kitchen, which is where she benefited most from the kitchen.
Martha insisted that she be allowed to keep her rocking-chair in the kitchen. MOLLOY 109 My weekly supply of lager, half-a-dozen quart bottles, was delivered every Saturday and I never touched them until the next day. Gaber and I, together, had emptied one bottle from the weekly supply and there were five bottles left in the pantry. The pantry contained five bottles, corked and sealed, and one open bottle three-quarters empty. I left without saying a word to Martha and went upstairs to my son's room, where he was admiring his stamps, two albums, large and small, open before him, and shut them hastily.
The conversation takes place in a room where a father and son are arguing about a rare and valuable stamp collection. The father accuses his son of looking at his stamps. The son accuses his father of transferring to an album of duplicates from his collection of rare, valuable stamps, which he has a habit of gloating over daily and could not bring himself to leave for a few days. He has a new Timor, the five reis orange, which cost him a florin and was a bargain at the time. He put it in the album. 1 goes to the door of the room and leaves both his albums at home, the small one and the large one, a prophetic present from his father.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who has a duty to protect his son's albums, which he keeps in a safe until their return. 110 SAMU ELIRA is upset with her son's lack of respect and has expressed her anger to him, demanding that he put the albums in the safe until they return home. 110 Samuel has a strong emotional attachment to his albums and has a deep-seated desire to keep them away from him. 110SAMUEL feels that her son has been lacking in respect, but she does not want to have him admit it. 110Samuel's son has lost his most cherished stamps, which she believes would have been an act of disobedience if he had put them in his pocket during their journey and gloated on them. 110 She feels that the loss of his most precious stamps would have led to his
If he had lost the gems of his collection, it would have been better for him to take the entire album, as an album is less readily lost than a stamp. But I was a better judge than he of what he could and could not do, and I knew that this ordeal would be of profit to him. I desired to impress upon him a lesson about the value of keeping his collection. I had the ability to use magic words which I did not understand until my fifteenth year. I was determined to impress this lesson upon him while he was young and tender. I feared that should this undertaking make me odious in his eyes and make him uncomfortable with fatherhood, I would pursue it despite the potential negative consequences.
After dinner, I drowse. I decided to make the most of my time alone. I took off my coat and shoes, opened my trousers and got in between the sheets. I believe that lying down is the best place for me to penetrate the outer turmoil’s veil, discern my quarry, find peace in another's distress, and pass judgement on those who are plunged in it and those who have need of me to be delivered. I am paid to seek and deliver.
I have experienced a sudden change in my life, causing me to feel a sense of fear, confusion, and fear. The sensation of things bursting, merging, avoiding one another, and sending different messages is overwhelming. I am at the mercy of these sensations, which I know to be illusory, but it is thanks to them that I have to live and work and find meaning. SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who experiences a sudden pain and finds himself in a state of fear and fear, which he interprets as a touch of neuralgia. Despite these feelings, Samuel Beckett is not unpleasant and goes back to work. Samuel trusts more serious and imputable less to pleasure than he trusts to his work, which is why he transferred this experience to the atmosphere of the world.
I was conducting an unprofitable examination which was of no utility for the execution of my orders. However, the examination may have established a connection between me and a man named Molloy, who was no stranger to me. I had no colleagues and knew nothing of the circumstances in which I learnt of his existence. If I had had colleagues, I might have suspected I had spoken of him to them, but I knew nothing about his existence prior to meeting him. I believe I had invented him, as if I had found him ready-made in my head. There is a possibility that one meets with strangers who are not entire strangers, through their having played a part in certain cerebral reels. Although this had never happened to me
Molloy was not mentioned to me by anyone but myself. Molloy 1 was the subject of rare conversations with men and I avoided such subjects. I would not have confided his existence to a living soul for anything in the world if anyone else had spoken to me about him. I had no colleagues and felt an immense uneasiness due to the fact that I was alone in this affair, which caused me to feel alarmed and uncomfortable. I knew nothing of MollOY's mother, Mellose, save for her name, which to me was less alive than her son, who was more alive than his mother.
Molloy has been mentioned by Gaber several times and each time with equal in- cisiveness. Gaber has said Molloy multiple times and has done so with equal intensity. I have a preference for the ending of the story, which is different from the others, and I feel compelled to admit that I too should have said Mollsoy and that in saying Mollose I was at fault. I knew little about Molls, but I did know about him. Molls had very little room and was limited in his time. Moll
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is described as massive, hulking, of a dark colour, and of a massive frame. He is depicted as a prisoner who has thrown himself at a specific target and sought refuge near the centre of a large, open space. He moves slowly, like a bear, and appears to be constantly on the move, occasionally stopping and glancing furiously about him.SAMUEL has the ability to move like a jungle creature, moving slowly and swaying to and fro, swaying his head, and uttering incomprehensible words. SAMUel has the capacity to cause uproar, rage, suffocation, and effort unceasing, and seems to be a source of intense interest and interest to those around him. Samuel has always appeared and will continue to appear until the end.
I find it hard to imagine what brought him to such a pass, and I am unable to conceive how, left to his own resources, he could put an end to it. I have my own natural end and I was resolved to have no other. I had no information as to his face, but I assumed it was hirsute, craggy, and grimacing. I found it strange that a man like me, meticulous and calm in the main, so patiently turned towards the outer world as opposed to the lesser evil, would let himself be haunted and possessed by chimeras.
I am a solitary individual who sees her existence as a weakness, a weakness to be deplored but necessary if she wishes to remain that way. I clung to my solitary existence with as little enthusiasm as I did to MOLLOY 115, my hens or my faith. I saw my life as a kind of inenarrable contraption, with little risk to my dreams and hopes. I have always believed that one doesn't wait to be hunted to hide, which has always been my motto. If I had to tell the story of my life, I would avoid mentioning these apparitions, and least mention the unfortunate Molloy, for his was a poor thing compared to others.
I was doing my work for a cause which was not for Molloy, who mattered to me, nor for myself, but for an anonymous cause. I was working on behalf of a cause that was in its essence anonymous and would subsist, haunting the minds of men, when its artisans should be no more. I did not take my work to heart, but rather, tenderly, for those old craftsmen, whose race is extinct and the mould broken. There was a strong resemblance between myself and a character named "Molloy T" and elements of "Gaber" described by Gaber. There were three Molloys, one of which was a caricature of Gaber's and the man of flesh and blood, presumably Youdi, who I was about to meet.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is interested in the existence of a fifth Molloy, a character who is said to be dogged by his shadow and capable of changing his mind with great facility. 116 Youdi is one of the five Molloys mentioned by Samuel Beckett. 116 Samuels BecketT was preparing to face Gaber's report and get down to the official facts when the sound of a gong, struck with violence, filled the house at 9 o'clock. 116 Samuel Beckett was at the table preparing the soup when the gong struck. 116 Martha, who was serving the soup, gave notice that the soup had begun to coagulate, which for her was always a source of pride and satisfaction. 116 Jacques was absent from the table and she asked him to come down at once.
The soup before me had stopped steaming, indicating that it had not been steamed for some time. Martha had made a joke which pleased her enormously and made her laugh so much she began to hiccup. Martha asked Jacques to come down because he was sick. Jacques refused to eat the soup, saying he's not hungry. Jacques was scarred in the face when he saw Martha's joke and asked her to tell MOLLOY 117 what she thinks of the soup.
"The sequel" was a term I had explained to him a few days before, explaining its meaning and application to him. I had high hopes that he would understand the term, but he was a cunning little fellow. The sequel was called by me because the rain had stopped and scarves of fine red sheen were mount- ing in the sky in the west. I felt the scarves rather than saw them through my little wood. Martha, who I had called "the sequel", appeared in front of me. "Shepherd’s pie" is a dish I like to serve to the turkeys I raise. I have always had great success with my turkeys and consider them better for rearing purposes.
Martha and her son are having a conversation about a bird. Martha suggests to her son that he should eat something hot before he leaves and suggests that he has a stomach-ache. The bird was a bird from the previous day. Martha is a bird who can only be in-sulting when she is in flight. Martha has a son who is inexperienced and young and inexperienced. The son denies that he told Martha that they were leaving. Martha's daughter has just been up to his room and made a pie for him.
I asked my son to fetch a minute-thermometer from the second right-hand drawer of my desk. I asked him to take his temperature and bring me the thermometer. I repeated a rather long and difficult sentence, which contained no fewer than three or four imperatives. As he went out, I added jocosely, "You know which mouth to put it in." I was not averse to jests of doubtful taste in conversation with my son in the interests of his education. I had a shepherd’s pie, which I made with a spoon and probed with a fork. I called Martha and said Martha's dog wouldn’t touch it.
My desk has only six drawers and three drawers on each side of the space where I put my legs. My son came back with a minute-thermometer and handed it to me. He had a temperature. I asked him to go to the door and switch on the light to check it. He did not have time to wipe the temperature on the minute thermometer, which made me squint at the mercury. Sometimes in the winter, I would find my slippers warming in front of the fire, the uppers turned to the flame, and I would wonder if he had shat. I would never dare invoke the old testament for fear of exposing herself to thunderbolts which might be fatal if he fell ill.
I gave him an enema, with salt water, and gave him a little wind. He struggled, but not for long. He lay down on the tiles, his big fat bottom sticking up, and let the enema soak in. I lit Father Ambrose's cigar and we went upstairs to the bathroom. The porcelain, mirrors, and chromium in the bathroom instilled a sense of peace within me, but it wasn't a great peace. I looked at the ash on my cigar and noticed that it was firm and blue. I brushed my incisors and brushed the back gums. I was annoyed by the sight of my moustache, which annoyed me because it suited me better without it.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT has a strained leg and an acute pain in his knee. He has no food in his stomach and is unable to eat anything. The character has had his lunch and is feeling ill. He is sitting on a pot of yellow liquid, which has shreds floating in it. He asks his father for an iodex to help him with his leg pain. The family is leaving in an hour or so. The characters read a story about two old hands, veined, ringed, seeking each other.
Iridex was used to rub iodine into my knee, which is full of little loose bones. I pulled up the leg of my trousers, rolled it in a fury around my thigh and sat down on a stool to rub the iodine into it. I let the iodine soak in and listened to the conversation. My son asked for a report from his father and was told that he would get his report. He was tired and asked his father to take him to bed. I offered to bring him something nice and light in bed, let him have a little sleep and then we would leave together. Martha watched me in silence, lolling in her rocking-chair. I prepared a bowl of hot milk, hot bread, a slice of bread and jam.
She asked me how long I expected to be away. She had waited until I was standing up, the laden tray in my hands, to ask me this question. I set the tray on a chair at the foot of the stairs and went back to the kitchen to make sandwiches. The milk in the fridge was getting cold and form- ing a revolting skin. She made the sandwiches and was about to go to bed. I advised her to get up in an hour or so to lock up and asked her to decide if it was worth going to bed under these conditions. When she went up to tell my son to come down, she must have noticed the knap- sack. MOLLOY 121 has no idea how long he was away.
I had a sudden cordiality towards Martha, shaking her hand and shaking it by the hand, which she hastily wiped away on her apron. I was often away from home and often took leave of Martha offhandedly, even when a prolonged absence was to be feared. Martha had been in my service for a long time and I had never taken leave of her in this manner before, even during prolonged absences. I had a cigar in my mouth, but it had fallen off and the ash from it fell off. I dissolved a sleeping-pow- der in the milk and left the tray with sandwiches for Martha. Martha asked for a report from the officer who was going out with the tray and asked him to get his report.
My son has been absent for a long time. He usually comes to fetch the thermometer. I was concerned that he might have taken advantage of the opportunity to secure some of his favourite stamps. I found a few stamps, including the Togo one mark carm! 10 with the pretty boat, the Nyassa 1901 ten reis, and several others. I decided to take 122 SAMUEL BECKETT from the tray a^c. I woke my son who was about to fall asleep. He ate and drank, grimacing with disgust. I waited until the last drop, the last crumb, had disappeared before I tucked him in and kissed him, within a hair's breadth of kissing him. Neither he nor I had uttered a word.
Molloy has a voluble personality and is extremely voluble when he thinks I'm not present. Despite his volubility, I was able to dampen Molloy's disposition. I desired this advantage for my son, that he should hold aloof from those who pride themselves on their eagle gaze. I had not struggled, toiled, suffered, made good, and lived like a Hottentot, and I wanted my son to do the same. I enjoyed playing my parts through to the bitter end and felt no remorse for shirking the issue. I let fall this suggestion for what it is worth, and per-functorily, I describe this day as he who suf- fered it.
I have a responsibility to provide for my son, and feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing that if he dies, it would be none of my doing. I feel that there is something in the house tying my hands. I went down to the garden and moved about in the almost total darkness in search of a cigar. I found it in my pocket the next day. My cigar had gone unnoticed and I had intended to put it in the ash-tray or waste-paper basket.
My son likes sleeping with a night-light beside him. Until recently, he could not sleep unless he had his woolly bear to hug. I sometimes felt it was wrong of me to let him have the night light beside him, but eventually I decided to forbid it. I found myself feeling low in the garden as well as in the house and decided to go into the house to confront the darkness in the kitchen. The kitchen had seemed to be in darkness from a distance, but in another sense the kitchen was in darkness.
In a house without a gas-oven, SAMUEL BECKETT discovered a faint reddish glow in the kitchen which could not have come from an oven, as the kitchen was equipped with a simple gas-stove, a gas oven, and a ;eal oven which was out of service.SAMUEL has a habit of prowling in the night and peering through windows to see what is going on. He has terrified more than one neighbour by doing this. SAMU EL BECKT finds no one in the house and goes upstairs to Martha's room, where he finds a night-light with a red chimney and a small Virgin carved in wood hanging on the wall.
I stopped at my son's door and applied my ear to the keyhole to listen but heard nothing. I took care not to open the door and went to my room to think. Moran was preparing to go on an expedition without consulting a map or time-table, without planning his route or itinerary and without considering the weather outlook. Moran had only a vague idea of the outfit he would need, the time the expedition would take, the amount of money he would require, and the nature of the work to be done and the means to be employed. I had recom- mended to my son. I put on an old pepper-and-salt shooting-suit with knee-breeches, stockings, and stout black boots, which made a poor show due to knock-kneed and skeleton thin legs.
I decided to wear a heavy heavy pair of black boots and a heavy massive-handled winter umbrella. I chose to wear my straw boater, which was yellowed by the rain and had lost its band. I considered wearing a black cloak, but decided to take the heavy umbrella due to its serviceable qualities. I consider the cloak to be a serviceable garment, providing freedom of movement to the arms and concealing them. I have more than one winter umbrella and consider it to be an indispensable garment. I could hardly hope to pass unseen in this outfit, but I did not wish to.
He was like a thousand other boys of his age and condition. There is something about a father that discourages derision and commands respect, and when a father is seen out with his young hopeful, his face grows longer and longer with every step, he is seen for being a widower. He is taken for a widow and has a wife long since deceased, leaving him with the prospect of being in a child-bed or worse, with a wife who has passed away. The thought of being seen with his son made me angry, as if he had desired my failure. If I could have reflected with calm on the work I was required to do, and not been distracted by the presence of my son, it would have seemed more likely to benefit rather than to suffer.
SAMUEL BECKETT, also known as SAMUEL, usually leaves her house, her garden, her village, and her house with regret. Samuel is a person who whistles for no particular reason, indicating that she is happy at heart to leave her surroundings. She has a large bunch of keys to her house that she keeps in the right-hand pocket of her trousers, and she carries them with her wherever she goes. SamUEL has a son who is restless, plaintive, and whinny for food, whining for sleep, so she took a tube of morphine tablets from her night-table drawer.
A chain attached to my braces prevents me from losing them. The chain is four or five times longer than necessary and lies coiled on the bunch, in my pocket. Its weight gives me a list to the right when I am tired or when I forget to counteract it by muscular effort. MOLLOY 127 is my son, who is in the first stages of puberty and suffers from stomach trouble. I woke him from his sleep and helped him out of bed, but he resisted and dug his nails into the mattress. I had to use all my strength to free him from the bed and he broke from my hold.
I was disgusted by Martha's exhibition and had to use my umbrella. I had bored two holes in the brim of my boater with a gimlet and secured the ends of an elastic long enough to pass under my chin, under my jaws, but not too long for it to hold fast. Despite the exertions of the umbrella, the boater stayed on my head. I would get angry if I were not careful, and anger is a luxury I can't afford. I went to the shed and hacked at an old chopping-block in the yard, splitting it with an axe. Martha met me on the stairs and was visibly distressed.
I went upstairs and helped my son put on his knapsack and told him not to forget his raincoat. I told him to carry it over his arm for the moment. It was nearly midnight and the night was fine, in my humble opinion. My son and I walked through a shambles, through a wooded area with a narrow path and a narrow wicket-gate. The path was too narrow for us to walk abreast, so I put my hand behind me and my son grasped it.
The scene takes place in a wooded area with a single chimney-stack and a serrated ridge. The house is partly hidden by the little wood. The area is full of songbirds, who knew and feared me. I used to think I loved my trees, bushes, flower-beds, and tiny lawns and cut branches and flowers for their good, believing it was solely for their growth and happiness. I grew no vegetables and I lied about having turkeys and a few hens. My grey hen was found on the ground, on a perch with the others, in a corner, at the mercy of the rats.
I have long since given up going for walks with my son due to his ease in finding his way and his knowledge of shortcuts. I had listened to a song in the evening, entranced by the sound of a hen-house music. I could just hear that adorable murmur of tiny feet, quivering feathers and feeble, smothered clucking that hen-houses make at night and that dies down long before dawn. Tomorrow I am free and I hope to keep it. I locked the wicket-gate and left in the lane after locking the gate. I wanted my son to walk like his father, with rapid steps, breathing even and economical, looking neither to left nor right, oblivious to everything and apparently oblivious to his surroundings.
My son often took a wrong turn or took a simple corner to stray from the right road due to his father's election. He did not heed what he was doing or look where he was going and went on mechanically plunged in a kind of dream. He and his father took their walks separately and regularly took the route that led them from home to church and, mass over, from church to home. My son was caught up in the slow tide of the faithful and was not alone with me. I waited for him to come back and spoke the words calculated to settle this matter once and for all.
Samuel Beckett and I have a son who has a tendency to wander off and leave me alone in a strange place. I toyed with the idea of attaching him to me by means of a long rope, its two ends tied about our waists. However, I am not sure that this is a good way of attracting attention and I am afraid that he might have undone his knots and escaped, leaving me to go on alone, trailing behind him like a burgess of Calais, until such time as the rope catching on a fixed or heavy object should stop her. SamuEL BECKETT suggests that we need a chain, not a soft, silent rope, but a chain which is not to be dreamt of. For an instant I entertained myself dreaming of it, imagining myself in a world less ill contrived and wondering how, having nothing more than a simple chain, without collar or band or gyves or fetters, I could chain my son to me in such a way as to prevent him from escaping.
The role of the keeper and sick-nurse is to keep an eye on her son during an expedition. She was called away by the image of her son, who was now behind her and before her. When she told him to keep behind her, he chose to go to the left instead of the left, which angered her. She cried out for him to come back to her. It was the summer holidays and his school cap was green with initials and a boar’s head, or a deer's, in gold braid on the front, and it lay plumb on his blond skull.
He carried his raincoat instead of folding it in a ball and was holding it with both hands, on his belly, instead of carrying it folded over his arm or flung across his shoulder as I had suggested. As for the raincoat, he had rolled it into a ball, holding it in both hands with both feet splayed, his knees sag- ging, his stomach sticking out, his chest sunk, his chin sunk, and his mouth open in an attitude of a veritable half-wit. Midnight struck, from the steeple of my beloved church, and I was gone from home. I asked him if he was capable of following me, and he did not answer, but I seized his thoughts as clearly as if he had spoken them. I hoped that he might have forgotten his scout-knife, which has five or six indispensable blades, a cork-screw, a tin-opener, a punch, a screw-driver, a claw, and a gouge for removing MOLLOY 131 stones from hooves.
I gave my son a scout-knife on the occasion of his first first prize for history and geography, subjects which he had excelled in. I had given it to him myself, which was for his first prize in these subjects, which were considered inseparable by the teachers at the school where he attended. My son was a great scholar, especially when it came to literature and the so-called exact sciences. He had a deep understanding of the human race's slow ascen- sion towards the light and a deep respect for the configuration of frontiers and the heights of mountain peaks. He was not averse to saving his own life by giving the knife to me in the night.
The character 132 SAMUEL BECKETT is a character in the Schoolboys’ Classics, a book about a character named Monte Cristo, who is depicted as a character with a soul similar to that of the character in Schoolboys' Classics, and is portrayed as a soft and soft-hearted character. 132SAMUEL has a knife in his pocket which he was about to use to cut off the throat of his father, who was in possession of the same knife he was holding in his hand. 132Samuel's father was a young man, a little on the soft side, with a soft side for the deeds of vengeance, but time was on his side and he consoled himself with the thought that he would have to wait for his son's vengeance to be done. 132 Samuel's father had left, accompanied by his son, in accordance with instructions.
I am a servant who has been forced to conduct her duties in a tedious relation. I have no intention of relating the various adventures which befell me and my son before they came to the Molloy country. However, I am willing to do so if it gives satisfaction to my employer and his colleagues. I do not have the imagination to imagine the content of the work, but I have more imagination than before. If I submit to the scriven- ing which is not of my province, it is for reasons very different from those that might be supposed. I am still obeying orders, but no longer out of fear, but out of habit. I listen to a voice within me that exhorts me to continue to the end the faithful servant I have always been, and to fulfil in all its bitterness my responsibility for a cause not mine.
The voice that I follow is ambiguous and not always easy to follow. Nevertheless, I follow it in the sense that I know what it means and that I do what it tells me. Yes, it is an ambiguous voice and it is not easy for me to understand its reasonings and decrees. However, I do not think there are many voices of which as much may be said. I follow the voice no matter what it commands, and when it stops, leaving me in doubt and darkness, I will wait for it to come back. I have drunk a little more than usual and may be of a different mind the next day. The voice tells me that the memory of this work will help me to endure the long anguish of vagrancy and vag
MoLLO Y 133 is concerned about her freedom and her future. She is worried about losing her home, her garden, trees, lawns, birds, and the way of life in her country. She fears losing the comforts of her home where she has worked hard to build, to adorn, to perfect, and to keep. She does not want to lose the comfort and security of her house and garden, but she is too old to lose all this and begin again. She has a strong desire to share her journey from her country to Molloy's, but does not intend to relate all the vicissitudes of the journey.
I left my home in the Molloy country, which is different from my own. My penance is to not pass over things that are no longer unknown to me, but still fondly believed which I fondly did at the time I set out. Although I occasionally break this rule, it is only over details of little im- portance, and I observe it with zeal. I do not exaggerate and I am more he who finds than he who tells what he has found. I know little better where I am going and what awaits me than the night I "lung to the wicket, beside my idiot of a son, in the lane, beside the lane".
 SAMUEL BECKETT has never crossed the Molloy country, a narrow region whose ad- ministrative limits he had never crossed and presumably never would have, unless through some extraordinary fortuitous con- junction of circumstances. The region referred to as the Bally market-town was situated in the north, situated in a less bleak region, and comprised a settlement, dignified by some with the name of Bally, and by others as no more than a village. Bally was described as having a surface area of five or six square miles at the most, and represented, with its dependent lands, a village-like surface area.
Bally and Ballyba are subdivisions of Bally. Ballybaba includes the domains ex-clusive to Bally itself. I live in Turdy, the hub of Turdyba. Turdybaba is located in the country outside Turdy and is known as the place where I get the most fresh air in the evening. Balybaba has a limited range and can boast of a cer- tain diversity, including pastures, copses, undulating undulating and almost smiling aspects, and a strangled creek which empties and fills with the slow grey tides.
Ballyba is a small village located on a small, meagre, meandering land with no cultiva- tion due to the existence of a sacred grove or a stretch of marsh from which nothing could be obtained beyond inferior turf or scraps of bogoak used for making amuldts, paper-knives, napkin-rings, rosaries and other knick-knacks. Martha's madonna is said to have originated from Ballyba. The land in Ballya is poor, consisting of a meadow, a few meadows and a few poor pastures, where quitchweed grew in abundance and bitter blue grass fatal to cows and horses.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT and his son walked for several days by sequestered ways to avoid being seen on the highways. The first day of their journey, Samuel found the butt of Father Ambrose’s cigar, which he had put in his pocket when changing his suit. SamuEL found the cigar in a pocket after finding it in the ash-tray, in the waste-paper basket, and in the pocket of his suit, which had happened unbeknown to him. The cigar was found by Samuels after he changed his suit and lit it, but he threw it away after taking a few puffs, which was the outstanding event of the first day. SamUEL showed his son how to use his pocket-compass, which gave him pleasure and he was behaving well, better than he had hoped. He gave him back his knife on the third day, and they walked ten miles a day and slept in the open with ten miles of good weather. Samuel's son knew how to make a shelter out of branches and made a camp fire, despite being in the scouts, but knew nothing about how to build a shelter.
The story takes place in a field where a farmer I knew is approaching a group of people, including a father and son. The father took the son by the arm and led him away in the direction of the farmer's field. The farmer overtook them and asked where they were going. The group was going home and had not yet left the field, suggesting they had not left it far behind.The farmer offered to give the group a lift and welcome, but said he won't be leaving till night. Fortunately, it was not yet midday and the farmer declined the offer, indicating he didn't want to wait until night. They made a wide detour and turned their faces to the north.
The conversation takes place during warm summer days. MOLLO Y 137 is working under a shelter under the boughs of a tree in the woods, trying to reconstruct Gaber's instructions to complete his statement. The sounds of her son making during his sleep hindered her in her efforts to reconstruct the instructions. Molloy, her son, has been found by Gaber and is presumed to have been killed. MOllo Y 137 was looking for what was necessary to complete Gaber’s statement to complete the Yerk affair. She felt that Gaber must have told her what to do with Molloys once he was found. MO
I found Yerk on the third day. Estab- lishing contact was the least important part of my work. I was never required to prove I had suc- ceeded, relying solely on my word. Sometimes I was asked for a report and on another occasion I was tasked with bringing the per- son to a certain place at a certain time for a delicate affair. The per-son was not a woman and I have never had to deal with a woman. I remember having invented a story about a woman who had been in love with him for six months and wanted to meet him in a secluded place. She was a well-known actress.
 SAMUEL BECKETT never saw any of his patients again after he finished with them and lost interest in them once he had finished his work. Samuel Beckett believes that he would have liked Sammie for a friend. Sammie has not seen any of her patients after she finished her work and has not heard from any of them again. SAMMEL Beckett has a lot of stories to tell, but she has not been able to tell this one. SAMMUEL Beckett was given directions by Gabcr to deal with Molloy, but the directions had gone out of her head and she could not determine how to approach him once she had found him.
I decided to find Molloy and devise a plan to deal with him. I had his address just as he had mine. I decided to send him a telegram and asked if there was a telegraph in Ballyba. Gaber has the ability to give an explicit reply to my telegram, which was not beyond his powers. I also told myself that the longer I took, the greater my chances of remembering what I was to do with him, and we would have peaceably pursued their way on foot if it wasn't for an incident that happened one night while I was trying to fall asleep beside my son.
The sensation I experienced was similar to that of a blow, similar to a horse's hoof, and I reacted in a similar manner to it, waiting anxiously for the pain to recur and sweating profusely. The pain recurred a few minutes later but was not as bad as the first time, suggesting that I was getting used to it. The sensation recurred several times, each time less bad than the previous one, until it subsided and I was able to go to sleep more or less reassured. I had experienced the pain before, in my bath- room, when giving my son his enema, but it had only attacked me once and never recurred. I went to sleep again wondering if it had been the same knee as the one which had just excruciated me.
My son was unable to tell me which of my knees I had rubbed with iodex the night we left. I suspect I have a touch of neuralgia brought on by tramping and trudging and cold damp nights and promising myself to procure a packet of thermogene wool with a pretty demon on the outside at the first opportunity. I woke up towards dawn with a mild erection, unable to get up due to a natural need to make things more lifelike. I was initially unable to bend my leg, but through sheer determination, I managed to bend it slightly. SAMUEL BECKETT had woken me up early in the night.
The pain was so severe that it made it impossible for me to kneel and I had to bend both knees. I had a bad knee, but it was not red or swollen and felt like a' clitoris. I examined the bad knee in the light of a torch and fiddled with the knee-cap. My son was puffing like a grampus and had no suspicion of what life could do to you. The sky was that horrible colour which heralds dawn. I sat down cautiously, and with a certain curiosity, on the ground. Anyone else would have tried to sit down as usual, off-handedly, but not me.
The experience of paralysis has given me a new understanding of human psychology. I have learned that when one is unable to stand or sit with comfort, one can explore the horizontal like a child in its mother's lap, exploring it as never before and finding hidden delights. When one is physically incapable of movement, the experience of exploring the horizontal becomes infinite and one can take refuge in the horizontal. If one is able to stand up, or even sit up, for a few seconds after paralysis, one has the advantage of a local and painless paralysis. I consider the great classical paralysis to offer analogous and perhaps even more unspeakable satisfactions.
The sky sinks in the morning and the earth lifts itself up to get a better view. My son woke up feeling ill and told me he didn't feel well. I could have woken him but decided not to, letting him wake naturally. I asked my son about the location of the nearest village and he named it. I knew the village, Condom, as I had been there and knew it was a small town and I had some acquaintances among its inhabitants. I learned from him that Condom is on the Baise. I advised him to buy a bicycle to fit his needs and gave him five pounds in ten-shilling for preference.
I gave instructions to 142 SAMUEL BECKETT to buy a bicycle from Hole, a distance of about 15 miles away. 142 Samuel Beckett understood the instructions but did not look pleased. 142 Samuel Beckett was stupefied by my instructions and expressed great joy at the conversation, as if he could not believe what I was saying. 142SAMUEL BUYED a bicycle second-hand from a venture, which he had heard about from another person, but he was unable to find one on his own. 142 SAM
He gave four pounds ten and five pounds ten notes to me. I counted the notes and gave them to him. I asked him to empty his pockets and he emptied them. When a pocket was emptied, he pulled out its lining and shook it, creating a cloud of dust. I suspected he had stolen ten shillings and was trying to hide them, but he did not know I was ill. I told him to stop and asked him if he was hiding the money he had taken. I didn't want him to know I wasn't ill and didn't know how much money I had.
I was away on business and did not keep the most rigorous accounts when I was doing so. I was throwing money away with as little concern as if I had been travelling for pleasure. I gave him notes and asked him to count them. He counted the notes and found out that I had given him only four pounds ten instead of five pounds. The notes he counted were worth 143 pounds ten shillings. I told him to buy a second-hand bicycle to which he replied that he did not know how much a bicycle costs.
I am not giving the main themes of the duet in full. I didn't tell him second-hand for preference. I told him about a ball of tangled string with ten shillings possibly inside it. I suggested that the ball of string could have been a second hand bicycle and suggested that if you can't find a secondhand bicycle, buy a new one. I repeated my advice to him to go to Hole, a place located about fifteen miles away, which he agreed to.
The bicycle was intended for SAMUEL BECKETT, who is nearly my size and nearly as tall as I am, but he initially did not understand who it was for. Jacques Moran, who was at home in Turdy, gave instructions to Samuel to buy a bicycle in Hole, which was the nearest locality. Jacques advised SamuEL to go to Hole and ask the police-sergeant, give his name and say it was Jacques Moran from Turdy who had sent him to buy the bicycle. Jacques had fore-seen that his son might have trouble with people asking him how he came by so much money, given his age and being so young. Jacques gave his son specific instructions about how he should approach the police and explain the situation. Jacques was concerned about Samu
He had a brand-new bicycle and was waiting for instructions to use it. When he was asked how he was feeling, he revealed that he doesn't feel well. He was waiting under a tree-trunk shelter under the shadow of a tree. I was sick of the sight of him and expressed that she is sick of him. He left the shelter and went about twenty paces away. I tried to look light-hearted and hailed him, but he turned away and went on. I shouted his name and called him a lamp, which he didn't understand. He came back towards me, but I waved him away, crying.
My son was running away from me when I made to pick up a stone or piece of wood or a clod, anything in the way of a projectile. I reached up above my head and hurled a live bough in his direction. He stopped and stared at me, his head on one side like a parrot. He spun around and took to his heels, apparently fearing I would run after him. I have a terrifying running style, with my head flung back, teeth clenched, my elbows bent to the full, and my knees nearly hitting me in the face. I often catch faster runners who stop and wait for me due to this way of running. As for the lamp, we did not need a lamp at the time, as the bicycle had taken its place in my son's life and his duties and inno- cent games.
It was in anticipation of those happy days that I had thought of the lamp and cried out to my son to buy a good one. I might have advised him about the bell, advising him to unscrew the little cap and examine it well inside to make sure it was a good bell and in good working order before concluding the trans-action and to ring it to hear the ring it made. I would help my son when the time came to fit his bicycle with the best lamps, both front and rear, and the best bells and brakes that money could buy. The day seemed very long and I missed my son. I ate several times and took advantage of being alone at last, with no other witness than God, to masturbate. My son must have had the same idea and he must have stopped on his way to
I was walking when a great weariness seized hold of my leg and I had to stop due to a heaviness. I took a little morphine and asked myself why I did not tell my son about my condition and why I had hidden it from him. I asked myself if I was secretly glad that this had happened to me, possibly to the point of not wanting to get better. I surrendered myself to the beauty of the scene and listened attentively to the sounds, faint and clear, borne to me on the air by the trees, fields, sky, and birds. Stretched out in the shelter, I brooded on the undertaking in which I was embarked and tried to remember what I was to do with Molloy when I found him. Eventually, I dragged myself down to the stream and washed my face and hands.
I saw a man who was standing a few paces off, standing motionless, with his back to me, wearing a heavy coat and leaning on a stick that was so massive and thicker at the bottom than at the top that it was more like a club. He was wearing a hat with an extraordinary shape and colour and had a huge shock of dirty snow-white hair. I looked him full in the face to show that I am not afraid. He did not throw a rapid glance at me, but instead lowered his eyes to think over what he had just seen. He had a coldness in his stare and a thrust in his thrust, like I have never seen before. His face was pale and noble, he could have been much over fifty.
The man has dirty, dirty, noble, dirty and hairy hair that swelled up on his skull. His accent is that of a foreigner or one who has lost the habit of speech. MOLLOY 147 thought the man was going to leave without saying a word to her, but he asked her to give him a piece of bread. He asked for bread and she offered him a tin of sardines. The man asked for fish and she gave him bread for his son who would probably be hungry when he came back. He broke the bread into two pieces and put them in his coat-pockets. Molly 147 offered the bread to him and asked him to look at her stick.
The character has a son who carries a heavy stick. He walks with a swift uncertain step, often changing his course and dragging the stick with him. The stick is light and heavy. The character wishes she could have been in the middle of a desert, under the midday sun, to look after her son until he was only a dot on the edge of the horizon. When her son did not come, she went back into a shelter and laid down under her son's raincoat. She lit a wood-fire to warm herself and started to feel sleepy. She fell asleep near the fire and said many things belonging to separate and apparency unconnected trains of thought.
The fire was out but the embers were still warm from the fire. My leg was no better but not worse, possibly due to a habit that was becoming a habit. I had listened to the 148 SAMUEL BECKETT knee and submitted it to various tests. I went into a copse to cut myself a stick, but found a suitable branch and realized that I didn't have a knife. I searched for my son's knife, but it was not among the things he had laid on the ground and he had not picked up. I found an umbrella in the copse and used it to cut herself a stick. I practised walking with the help of the umbrella, and though I moved no faster and no less painfully, I did not tire.
I had to stop every ten steps to rest due to a defect in the bloodstream. However, when I leaned upon an umbrella, the heaviness in my leg disappeared and I was able to walk more quickly. Once equipped, I no longer restricted myself to circling about the shelter and radiated from it in every direction. I gained a better view of the expanse from which my son might suddenly rise into view. I imagined him, bent over the handlebars or standing on the pedals, draw- ing near and I heard him panting and saw his joy at being back at last.
The second day has been spent in a vain state of activity, with Molloy and his companions trying to find their way back to their shelter, which they are beginning to think of as their little house. The shelter is beginning to become their little home, and they are running out of their provisions of food, leaving them with only two tins of sardines, a handful of biscuits, and a few apples. They are discussing what they want to do once they find him. They also discuss the idea of ageing, which seems to present itself as a form of decay and change.
I saw a little globe swaying up slowly from the depths of the water, smooth and scarcely paler than its escorting ripples, and a face, with holes for the eyes and mouth and other wounds. I did not know if it was a man’s face or a woman's face, a young face or an old face, or if its calmness was due to the water trembling between it and the light. I felt a sense of disaster and a resignation of being dispossessed of self. I attended but absently to these poor figures and did not labour at them more diligently due to my sense of distress and loss of self-preservation. It was not in my nature to conduct calculations simultaneously, but to conduct them separately and turn about separately.
The missing instructions concerning Molloy triggered a memory of missing instructions that led to a change in the course of events. Similar to the missing instructions, when the memory of these instructions stirred in the depths of her memory, she turned towards other unknowns. Whereas a fortnight ago, she was planning how long she could survive on the provisions she had left, calculating calories and vitamins and planning a series of menus asymp- 150 SAMUEL BECKETT totically approaching nutritional zero. She was aware that she would soon be dead of inanition if she did not renew her provisions. An incident occurred on the second day of her journey where she was hailed by a man. She reacted violently when she heard the voice of a man, but she continued to busy herself with her fire, poking it with a branch she had torn from a tree for the purpose.
The dragon-tree of Teneriffe, which lived for five thousand years, was struck by lightning and died at the age of 5,000 years. The branch was thick and full of sap and did not burn when I stuck it in the fire. I held it by the thin end by the crackling of the fire, which allowed a man to come up to me without my knowledge. I was taken by surprise by the man who approached me, causing me to react with fear and anger. The man was a dim man, dim of face and dim of body, dim in light and dim in dark, but his face was worthy of his body.
The intruder is described as MOLLOY 151, a small, thick-set man who wears a thick navy-blue suit (double-breasted) of hideous cut, a pair of out-rageously wide black shoes with high toe-caps higher than the uppers, a dark muffler, and a narrow-brimmed dark blue felt hat with a fish-hook and an artificial fly stuck in the band.
The character has a face that resembles her own, with features like a moustache, ferrety eyes, a paraphimosis of the nose, and a thin red mouth. She has a limp and is unable to walk due to a limp. The character is a character who has a card, but she refuses to give it to him. He asked her if she had seen an old man with a stick pass by and described him to her. She refused to give him her card and he asked her to call her son who might arrive at any moment.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has seen no one and believes he has been alone for a long time, possibly for some time. 152 SAMU ELIZABETT is in a place where he believes he can still see a hand coming towards him, a hand that is pallid and pallid, opening and closing as if self-propelled, and seems to self-sufficiently open and close. 152 Samuel believes he is on a night patrol and has an idea about what is going on there. 152 Samuel finds Sammie stretched on the ground, his head in a pulp, and finds him with a few scratches on his body. 152SAMUEL is in the late stage of his relation and does not intend to give way to literature at this late stage, he is not interested in literature. 152Sammie found Sammie who no longer resembles him and dragged him backwards into a shelter, noticing that Sammie's leg was bending normally and his
My son was wearing suspenders that had come undone and were hanging loose. His legs were on the stiff side, with some play in the hip joints. My fingers encircled them nearly to the level of his suspenders. I went back to the shelter and took my son’s raincoat and laid down next to a fire, listening to the owls and distant corncrakes. I listened to a nightin- gale and listened to distant birds that cry and sing at night. I watched the fire dying, my cheek pillowed on my hands, and I watched out for the dawn. I packed and shouldered the two bags, took the raincoat, the umbrella, and threw the branches over the body.
Before leaving the camp, I consulted with myself to make sure I was not forgetting anything. I discovered that my keys were no longer in my pockets and scattered on the ground. I found MOLLO Y 153 keys scattered around the camp. The keys had broken into three pieces, the chain, keys and the ring, and I managed to recover them by laying down flat on my stomach among the keys. When a key was beyond my reach, I dragged it over to the grass and wiped each key on the grass before putting it in a pocket. Eventually, I located a number of keys at some distance from me, which I reached by rolling over and over.
I did not know how many keys I was looking for. I found an ear which I threw into the copse. I also found my hat which I thought was on my head. One of the holes for the elastic of the hat had expanded to the edge of the rim and was no longer a hole, but a slit, but the elastic had been spared and the elastic was still in it. I decided to run my eyes over the area for the last time and found the ring, first one piece and then the other piece. I jammed the hat hard down on my skull, folded my son's raincoat over my arm, caught up the umbrella and went. I stopped at the crest of a rise to survey the camp-site and the surrounding area.
The land from where I was and the clouds in the sky were so disposed to lead the eye gently to the camp, suggesting a painting by an old master. I made myself as comfortable as possible by eating a whole tin of sardines and one apple and laying down flat on my son’s coat. I propped my elbows on the ground and placed my 154 SAMUEL BECKETT jaws between my hands, which carried my eyes towards the horizon, and made a little cushion of two hands on ground and laid my cheek upon it, resting my cheek on it for five minutes one, five minutes the other. I could have made myself a pillow of thojiags, but it did not occur to me. The third day passed tranquilly, without incident, except for a dog sniffing about the remains of my fire and disappearing into a copse. I mended my hat with a tin-opener and pierced a new hole beside the old one and made fast the elastic elastic of the hat.
I made a ring, twisting the two pieces together, mending the ring, and making fast the long chain. again and I also mended the keys and made fast the keys. I asked myself a number of questions to kill time and tried to answer them. For example, I asked questions about what had happened to the blue felt hat, if they would suspect the old man with the stick, and if his chances of exonerating himself were slight. I decided not to tell my son about the events, fearing he would denounce me and denounce me. I felt much as usual, much like I had changed and was still changing, and in spite of this, I still felt much the same. I found the answers to some of the questions I had asked in vain, often to ones I had already asked.
The character has written with a firm and even satisfied hand and a calmer mind, indicating a calm mind. The character expects to be far away before these lines are read, in a place where no one will come to look for them, and is confident that Youdi will take care of her. She believes Youdi would not let her son be punished for a fault committed in the execution of her duty. She foresees sympathy and offers of help and esteem for him from all sides. The third day wore away and by five o'clock she had eaten her last tin of sardines and a few biscuits, leaving her with only a few apples and few biscuits. At about seven o’clock, her son arrived, the sun was low in the west and he was already between her and the camp.
 SAMUEL BECKETT was pushing a bicycle which he had dropped with a gesture indicating he was unable to bear it any more. He was carrying a bicycle that had once been a good bicycle and was described as such by Samuel as having a handlebar handle and a handle that could have been used for hooking something with the handle. SamuEL had a fall, indicating that he had experienced a fall.SAMUEL has a plant that springs from the ejaculations of the hanged and shrieks when plucked, which he gave for four pounds.
The seller asked for four pounds five instead of the correct amount for the purchase of a bicycle. The seller had a receipt for the bicycle, but he did not know what a receipt was. The money I spent on my son's education was for his education. He had a puncture two miles from Hole and he had to walk the rest of the way to get the bicycle repaired. The first day the shops were closed, the second day they reopened, and the seller spent the ten shillings on the carrier.
The dirty little twister was letting air escape between the valve and the con- nection which he had purposely not screwed tight, causing the tyre to get hard. I asked my son to hold the bicycle and give me the pump to fix the tyre. My son protested, but I put a stop to that and the tyre became hard again. He took a bar of chocolate from his pocket and offered it to me, but instead of eating it, he cast it from him. We went down the road and I tried to sit down on the MOLLOY 157 carrier, but the foot of my stiff leg tried to sink into the ground, into the grave. I added another bag to the carrier to keep her steady, but it was still too low. I have a horror of waste and the more things resist me
My son and I were riding a bicycle, and I was carrying bags, a raincoat, a carrier and string, and an umbrella. I had both hands free to hold on to my son by the waist, under the aimpits. My seat was higher than his, and by the time we fell, I felt a sharp pain in my shin and was tangled up in the back wheel of the bicycle. My son helped me up, but his stocking was torn and his leg was bleeding. He was bleeding and had a torn stocking. I was thinking of phlebotomy at the time. I caught him a smart blow on the hamstrings with my umbrella.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT and his son are on a bicycle ride. Samuel Becket has a sick leg, which makes it difficult for him to start off gently. Samuel Becket's son straddles the frame of the bicycle and starts off gently, with his feet clear of the ground, and his good leg supporting the back wheel. The bicycle starts to turn and the wheels start to turn, causing SamuEL Becket to follow closely behind. Samusel Beckett's son has a strong heart and his heart is beating under his hand, but his hand is far from his heart. Sam
In this way we came to Ballyba. I shall not tell of the obstacles we had to surmount, the fiends we encountered, the misdemeanours of the son and the disintegrations of the father. My intention was to tell of all these things, but now the intention is dead and the desire to do so is gone. My son often complained of his health, his stomach, his teeth, and he often looked worse and worse. I gave him some morphine and patched up his bicycle after a bicycle accident. My leg was no better but the skin on it had healed. I would not have made it to the destination without the help of my son. We spent a long time getting there and lost our way for weeks. I did not know what I was to do with Molloy when I found him.
The character has a character who is described as clumsy, stupid, slow, dirty, untruthful, deceitful, deceptive, prodigal, and unfilial. MOLLOY 159 has a son who takes good care of her, despite being clumsy, slow and dirty, and taking a lot of responsibility for her care. They took a long time to get to Ballyba, and they even got there without knowing it, because of a shepherd who was sitting on the ground stroking his dog and a flock of black shorn sheep who were unafraid.MOLLOY found a shepherd and his dog on the side of the road and walked towards them, stopping and resting on the grass, leaning on her umbrella. MOllOY 159 noticed that the shepherd watched her as she approached, without getting up, and the dog and the sheep turned and faced her, indicating some uneasiness, but they did not seem timid.
The scene takes place with a shepherd, a sheep, a dog, and a flock of sheep. The shepherd has a pipe in his mouth and is holding it to the ground. The dog's eyes follow the movement of the pipe and the shepherd's hand following it. The sheep and the dog are in a circle around the shepherd, their eyes converging on him, as if he is the butcher who is about to make a choice. The Shepherd has a servant named Ballyba, who promises to serve him faithfully and is willing to serve for a place to lie and a little bit of food.
The man has a pipe and is smoking a blue smoke from it. He gestures with the stem of his pipe at the ground, indicating that he wants food. The pipe is still smoking faintly and the smoke hangs blue in the air. The dog and the shepherd are all turned to the north. 160 SAMUEL BECKETT has a dog and a sheep, who seem to have lost interest in the conversation, and they are grazing on a grassy plain. Juno's milk lay like a faint splash on the sharp dark^ sweep of the horizon.
I was alone with my son, feeling spellbound and wondering how to depart without self-loathing or sadness. I watched a flock of sheep, a man, a woman, a dog, and a flock moving away and felt a sense of immense sigh when it was revealed that it was not I who was departing but the flock. The flock moved away in perfect order, with the shepherd silent and the dog unheeded. The shepherd stood aside to let the flock pass and counted them as they passed, not missing a single one. When the flock passed, the shepherd went to his cottage and sat down at the table, without taking off his hat. That night, he had a violent scene with his son.
I have had many scenes with my son, and at the time it seemed like any other. My MOLLOY 161 infallible technique brought him to a proper sense of his iniquities. However, the next day I woke up alone in a shelter and found myself alone for some considerable time due to him disappearing with his knapsack and raincoat. He had left with a considerable sum of money, he who was only entitled to a few pence from time to time, for his
My son has been under my supervision and has been in charge of everything, including the shopping and money. He always has a significant amount of money in his pocket and always has more money than he needs. I desired him to learn double-entry book-keeping and instructed him in its rudiments. 3. I had told him to keep an eye out for a second bicycle, light and inexpensive, as I was tired of the carrier and saw the day approaching when my son would no longer have the strength to pedal for himself and me. I believed I was capable of learning to pedal with one leg and I wanted to resume her rightful place in the van and follow her son.
 SAMUEL BECKETT's pocket-book contained only fifteen shillings, which led to the conclusion that her son had gone through her pockets before he left and taken the money. 162 SAMU ELIZABETH'S first feeling of gratitude was gratitude for her son leaving her a small sum of money, enough to keep her going until help arrived. 162 Samuel Beckett was alone, with her bag, umbrella, and the remaining money in her pockets, in Ballyba, but she was in a place far from Bally. 162 She was alone and feeling coldly abandoned by her son, possibly in the place where he had abandoned her. 162 Samuel Beckett's son had eaten her last pro- visions, which he could easily have taken. 162 After being alone, SamuEL Becket
I have harbored childish hopes that spring eternal, childish hopes, such as that my son would have pity on me and come back to me, or that Molloy, whose country this was, would come to me who had not been able to reach out to him and become a friend and like a father to me. I let these hopes spring within me and grow in strength, brighten and charm me with a thousand fancies, and then I swept them away with a great dis- gusted sweep of all my being. In the evening, I turned to the lights of Bally and watched them shine brighter and brighter and then all go out together, indicating that they were all flickering lights of terrified men. I think I might be there now, but for my misfortune. I have refrained from speaking to the Obidil, whom I longed to see face to face, but I have never seen him.
The character MOLLO Y 163 experiences a strong fit of laughter at the thought of possible punishments inflicted by Youdi, causing her to shake and her whole body to shake. MOLLY Y 163's laughter caused her to lean against a tree or against a bujW when the fit came on her, her umbrella being no longer sufficient to keep her from falling. She describes her laughter as a strange and possibly misnamed form of laughter, possibly due to indolence or ignorance, and describes herself as drawing towards it as the sands towards the wave, similar to the image of a turd waiting for the flush, which seems to fit her situation.MOLLY 163's heart once missed a little beat in her home when a fly, flying low above her ash-tray, raised a little ash, and she grew weaker and weaker and more and more content after this event, despite not eating anything for several days.
I was spending the day in a shelter and felt content, content, and almost elated with my performance. Gaber's arrival put an end to these activities. I had just crawled out of the shelter to have a good laugh at the lights of Bally when Gaber arrived. He had already been there for some time and was sitting on a tree-stump, half asleep. Moran, Gaber, was dressed as he was the last time I had seen him and was dressed in his Sunday clothes. Moran is not familiar with 164 SAMUEL BECKETT's voice.
Jacques has a small electric torch and a notebook, which he uses to communicate his thoughts and feelings. He is a character named Moran, who suffers from a sickness and is unable to walk. He has a son who has abandoned him. Moran is sick and unable to hear Jacques' words. Moran has not shaved since the day his son brought back the bicycle from Hole, he has not combed his hair, nor washed, and he has suffered privations, privations and great inward metamorphoses. Jacques is dying of thirst. Moran does not recognize Jacques.
Gaber is concerned about a man named Moran who keeps rubbing his hands from morning to night. Gaber believes that Moran is angry with him. Moran has been telling Gaber what he told him the other day. Moran is getting old and is getting worse, according to Gaber, who is beginning to give him a serious pain in the arse. Despite her loathing for MOLLO Y 165, Gaber overtook Moran and held him back by the sleeve, despite her weakness and a sick leg.
Gaber has a walrus moustache, chestnut in colour, and he has a deep voice. Gaber was pushed to the ground by a man who did not intend to make him fall and only wanted to push him away. He was not brutal, according to Gaber, who knew him well. The man had a solicitude towards Gaber and wanted to help him up, but Gaber pushed him away and asked him about what he had told someone else, which he revealed to be a clod. The clod told Gaber that life is a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.
SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who has a faithful umbrella. Smiles are very nice in their own way, but they are at a reasonable distance. SAMUEL has torn up a lot of grass and earth and was uprooting it when he woke up. He desisted from uprooting and set out for home that night, but he did not get far. Each day saw Samuel advance a little further, and he counted by tens of steps each time he reached a certain distance.
I used to think that men would never get the better of me. I used to believe I am cleverer than things. I ate, in accordance with the voice of reason, nature, the woods, the fields, the waters, and nature itself. I finished the morphine in August or September and was ordered home in the spring of the following year. I had been all winter on the way. When a thing resists me, even if it is for my own good, it doesn't resist me long. The snow, for example, initially resisted me more than it resisted me, but eventually I vanquished it, grinding my teeth with joy. I forged my way through the snow towards what I would have called my ruin if I could have conceived what I had left to be ruined.
On the way home, a prey to the malignancy of man and nature and my own failing flesh, I experienced a knee injury that was neither more nor less painful than the previous one. I was thinking about flies that hatch out at the beginning of winter, die shortly after, and are described as puny, sluggish, torpid, mute, and possibly very young. I like to think of these flies as those that hatch from warm, warm corners and die very young, without being able to lay. But I was succumbing to other affections at the time, and for the most part, I would not have described them.
If I once made up my mind not to keep the hangman waiting, I would have made it home on all fours and would have performed a ritual of cleansing and chanting maledictions. However, I will not dwell on the journey home due to fear and fear of fiends in human shape and phantoms of the dead that tried to prevent me from getting home. I will only utter one or two words for my own edification and to prepare my soul to make an end.Certain theological questions of a theological nature preoccupied me.
The questions are about devils and devils not feeling the pains of hell and the excommunication of vermin in the sixteenth century. 8. Saint-Roch refused to suck on Wed- nesdays and Fridays. 9. Lovat, an Italian cobbler, had 168 SAMUHL BECKETT cut off his testicles and crucified himself. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. Judas’ torments are suspended on Saturdays. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21.
The questions are:. 8. Would I go to heaven? 9. Would we all meet again in heaven? 10. Youdi, Gaber, Molloy, his mother, Yerk, Murphy, Watt, Camier and the rest. 11. Zulu, the Eisner sisters, are they still living? 12. Acacia Square is Youdi's business address. 13. If I wrote to Youdi and went to see him, I would crave his forgiveness. 14. The winter has been exceptionally severe and I have gone without either confession or communion. 15. The name of the martyr who, being in prison, celebrated the consecration of consecration on his stomach and gave himself absolution.
The dance of the bees involves a system of signals by which the incoming bees, satisfied or dissatisfied with their plunder, communicate with the outgoing ones. I alone of all mankind knows this phenomenon to the best of my belief. The dance is best observed among the bees re- turning to the hive, laden with nectar, and involves a great variety of figures and rhythms. The outgoing bees dance and communicate with each other during the dance. However, when the bees are away from the hive and busy at work, they do not dance. The most striking feature of the dance is its very complicated figures traced in flight and their probable meanings. I first deduced that each figure is reinforced by a hum peculiar to it, but I was forced to abandon this hypothesis when I saw the same figure repeated by different hums.
The purpose of the hum is not to enhance the dance, but to vary it, according to the figure and the hum. 170 SAMUEL BECKETT has collected and classified a great number of observations on this subject, with gratifying results, and has developed a conviction that the selfsame figure, accompanied by the self-same hum, does not mean the same thing at twelve feet from the ground as it does at six feet. 170SAMUEL believes that the bees do not dance at any level, but at three or four levels, always the same, at which tftey danced. 170Samuel has measured the levels and the relations between them with care, but he is concerned not to jeopardize his credit by revealing the details. Despite all his efforts, Samuel is stupefied by the complexity of this dance, involving other determinants
During the long journey home, the thought of my bees and their dance was the closest thing to comfort for me. I admitted with good grace that the dance might not be as meaningful as the dances of the people of the West, but for me it would always be a noble thing to contemplate, too noble to be sullied by the cogitations of a man exiled in his manhood. I have spoken of a voice giving me orders or advice, but it was on the way home that I heard it for the first time. Physically speaking, I was becoming unrecognisable, and when I passed my hands over my face, the face I felt was not my face any more and the hands my face felt were my hands no longer.
I had an old belly that was covered with deep lesions and wounds. I knew who I was, but I did not know my old belly. I had a sharper and clearer sense MOLLO Y 171 of my identity. I was less fortunate than other acquaintances due to the deep lesions on my belly and the wounds with which it was covered. Then there are clothes that cleave close to the body and are inseparable from it. I have always been very fond of tough and good cut clothing, and I had to part with two pairs of stockings due to cold and damp, trudging and lack of laundering facilities.
I have blue flesh between the knicker-bockers and the tops of my boots. My boots became rigid due to lack of proper care. My drawers and breeches rotted due to constant contact with my incontinences. I discarded two pairs of drawers (two pairs) and the seat of my breeches before it too decomposed, sawed my crack from Dan to Beersheba. I often wore my shirt inside out and back to front, and I had four ways of wearing my shirt: front to front right side out, front to back inside out, side to side, and front to side inside out. I kept my tie, knotted around my bare neck, out of sheer bravado.
The character 172 SAMUEL BECKETT has a spotted tie, but she can't remember the colour of it. She has a dilemma when it rains, when it snowed, and when it hailed, and she has to choose between leaning on her umbrella and taking shelter under her open umbrella. She is able to use her umbrella as a shelter and not as a support, due to the watertightness of her umbrella. 172 Samuel BecketT is unable to walk without the umbrella's support. 172 Samuel Beckett could have made herself a stick out of a branch and gone on, despite the rain, the snow, and the hail, leaning on the stick and the umbrella open above her.172 SamuEL BeckETT sometimes gets drenched in the rain and often she stops dead and waits for the rain to stop before opening the umbrella above her and getting equally drenched.
When it was raining heavily, I would have waited for the rain to stop before taking advantage of the opportunity to shelter under an umbrella. When my arm was weary of holding up the umbrella, I gave it to another hand and used it to keep the blood trickling freely or to draw it over my face in a gesture that is characteristic of me. My best thoughts came to me during these halts during the rain. When it became clear that the rain would not stop all day or all night, I built a proper shelter. I did not like proper shelters made of boughs any more as soon as there were no more leaves, only the needles of certain conifers. However, when I was inside the proper shelters, I could think of nothing but my son's raincoat, which was a trench-coat and filled all space.
MOLLOY 173 prefers sheltering under umbrellas, trees, hedges, bushes, or shrubs, and prefers to take shelter under umbrella shelters. MOLLY 173 has no intention of taking to the road to seek help for shelter and has no desire to turn for help to villages or the peasants, as indicated by the fact that she reached home with her fifteen shillings intact after spending two days alone and alone in a place where she was alone, waiting quietly under her umbrella for the weather to clear, when she was brutally accosted from behind by a farmer who was wearing an oilskin, a bowler hat, and wellingtons, and holding a lantern in his hand. The farmer was a big ruddy farmer, wearing a
In one hand he held a spade with which he threatened to kill me with if necessary. In the other he seized me by the jacket and by the lapel, threatening to shake me. 174 SAMUKL BECKETT was on someone's land, which was his land, but she did not own it and she was trespassing on someone else's land at night and in bad weather in a place not fit for a dog. 174 Samukl Beckett has a reputation for raising her eyebrows and has a pronounced voice, which impresses him, and she has a fairly dis- tinguished voice when she chooses to use it. 174 Samuel Beckett has a vow to the Turdy Madonna, which she refers to as a pilgrimage.
I lost my infant boy and kept his mamma due to the influence of a woman named Ninette. I owe this to Ninette, who I consider the Madonna of pregnant women, especially of pregnant married women. I have vowed to thank Ninette for saving my son's life. I asked for a favour from a cattle breeder, asking for hot tea to revive me, which he granted.
MoLLOY has sworn to make a bee-line to her and has made a promise to do so. MOLLOY took a florin from his pocket and gave it to him for a poor-box for charity. He has a plot to own a plot in perpetuity, which is a great thing to own but a great deal of work to maintain it. He skirted the graveyard at night, at a steep lane and in the dark, with a little wind and a faint sky, and found a wicket that was locked properly, but he could not open it.
The key went into a hole, but it didn't turn. I burst it open and hurled myself at the hole. I had come home, as Youdi had told me. I smelled sweet, lilacs and primroses and decided to go towards my hives. I found a hive with a sharp roof, steep over-hanging slopes, empty trays, and a dry, dry light ball of honey in a corner of the hive. The bees had been left out all winter, their honey taken away, without sugar. My hens were dead too, but they had not been killed in the same way as the grey one. I went to the hen-house, but the door was locked.
The house was empty and the company had turned off the light. 176 SAMUEL BECKETT had keys to Martha's room, but there was no one in there. 176 Samuel Beckett was offered to let the company keep the light but decided to let them keep it. 176 Samuel Beckett received a letter from Youdi asking for a report from Gaber and a visit from Father Ambrose, both in the third person. 176Samuel Beckett left the house and went back to the ghrden, where he found a handful of bees and a little dust of annulets and wings, some letters from Savory, and found his son, who was well, in the box of letters at the foot of the stairs. 176SAMUEL Beckett is clearing out and hopes to meet Molloy.
Hanna gave me news of Zulu, of the Eisner sisters, and Zulu. Hanna knew who I was and was not afraid of me. Hanna talked to me from her window, she never went out, she disliked going out, and she talked about Zulu and Eisner. 1 has crutches and plans to use them to go faster and learn. He has been a man for a long time and has heavy debts. He decides not to light the lamp again and to go into the garden. He thinks of the long May and June days, when he lived in the garden, which were lovely days. The winter had been exceptionally rigorous and the summer was superb, but he did not know if they had a right to this superb summer. Hanna's birds had not been killed, they were wild and trusting and seemed to recognise him. Hanna tried to understand their language better without recourse to his language.
The language I was speaking to did not use the words that Moran had been taught to his little one when he was a child. Initially, I did not understand what the language wanted. Eventually, I understood the language and understood that it wanted me to write a report. I was getting to know it better now, to understand what it wanted. However, the language didn't use words Moran was taught by his father. I do not know if I am freer now than I was before, but I understand it better. I went back into the house and wrote the report after midnight, despite the rain beating on the windows. PART II ★ MAEONE DIES.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has been abused by those who have abused her ever since she was born. She no longer has a need for prettiness and prefers to let herself die quietly, without rushing things. She has moved to a place where she feels more neutral and inert, where she can no longer weigh upon the balance. She still has occasional fits of impatience, but she is less given to them since coming to this place. 180 Samuel Beckett believes that she will be natural at last and will not be hot or cold any more, she will pay less heed to herself, she shall be neither hot nor cold, she shah be tepid, and she will die
I have an old debtor who owes money to me. I am waiting for him to repay me and while waiting, I will tell myself stories. The stories I tell will not be the same kind of stories as before, they will be calm and lifeless, devoid of ugliness, beauty or fever, and will be almost lifeless. I look forward to these stories giving me great satisfaction and satisfaction. I have enough money to repay the debt and do not need anything more. I do not forgive anyone and I wish them an atrocious life and then the fires and ice of hell and in the execrable generations to come an honoured name.
The character $ MALONE DIES 181 has been trying to play with others for nearly a century. too, all went well at first, with the players being pleased that someone was interested in playing with them. However, it was not long before he found himself alone in the dark and gave up trying to engage in play. He has decided to play only part of the time from now on, if he can, and he intends to play a great part of it if possible. If he doesn't succeed, he will play with himself. He plans to tell himself four stories during the night.
The story has a theme of a man, a woman, a third story about a thing, an animal, a bird, and a fourth one about an animal. Perhaps the story will be about a man and a woman in the same story. However, it's possible that the story might not have time to finish. If the story is finished too soon, the remaining items in the possession will be discussed as a kind of inventory. The inventory is a thing that I have always wanted to do, and it will not take more than a quarter of an hour at the most, if I am short of time.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is aware of the possibility of dying suddenly and considers leaving an inventory of his possessions. He has been planning to do this for a long time and has long dreamed of doing it. He intends to start with the first story about a man and a woman, which will be the first of three stories, followed by one about an animal and one about a thing, probably a stone.
1 used to not know where she was going but knew she would arrive and knew there would be an end to the long blind road. Now the case is reversed, the route is well-charted and there is little hope of coming to its end. 1 finds it hard to get used to the idea of losing time or gaining it. 1 has decided to remind herself briefly of her present slate before starting to write stories. She thinks this is a mistake but she will indulge in it and consider it a weakness. She plans to add it as a pendant to the inventory. aesthetics is on her side as she needs to become earnest to speak of her possessions.
MALONE DIES 183 has been finding something attractive about the present state of the five stories, three stories, inventory, with an occasional interlude and a full programme. MALONE has been left alone in a room for the past few days. She believes the room seems to be hers and believes she has been in it alone for a long time. She has listened at different hours of the day and night and has never heard any suspicious or unusual sounds, only the peaceful sounds of men at large.
I find myself in a private room in an ordinary house in what appears to be a plain ordinary house. I do not remember how I got there, possibly in an ambulance or a vehicle of some kind. I have fainted and lost consciousness, which resulted in a hiatus in my recollections and a temporary hiatus in recollections until I recovered my senses. As to the events that led up to my fainting, I have no memory of them and they have left no discernible trace in my mind. I remember walking all my life, except for the first few months and since I have been here. I often amused myself with trying to invent events, but without success.
L has lived in a kind of coma for six months and has experienced a loss of consciousness, possibly due to a blow to the head. L believes she was stunned with a blow, possibly in a forest. L has little experience of rooms and finds the room she is in an ordinary room. L feels the sands are running out and believes she is running out. She feels a strong sense of being beyond the grave six months ago. If it had been foretold to L that one day she would feel herself living as she does to-day, she would have smiled.
The character intends to write memoirs after completing an inventory. There is a cupboard where her possessions are kept in a corner and she can rummage through them, draw them to her, and send them back. Her bed is by a window and she lies turned towards it most of the time. She does not see any fields or hills, but she can see roofs and sky and a glimpse of a street if she crane. She doesn't see the sea and can hear it when it is high. She can see into a room of the house across the way. She has a big shaggy head against the window-pane and has long hair.
The moon is familiar to me and I am familiar with her changes of aspect and orbit. I know more or less the hours of the night when I may look for her in the sky and the nights when she will not come. The clouds are varied, very varied, and there are many birds that perch on the window-sill, asking for food. I never give them anything, but they still come. They are not vultures, but birds. I am left alone and looked after by a hand that puts a dish on a little table left for me each day and takes away the dish of the previous day. I eat one time out of two, out of three, on an average, when my chamber-pot is full.
I live in a room with two pots, one of which is a bed and the other a blanket-covered bed. I am never hot, never cold, and I don't wash, but if I get dirty, I rub the part of the pot with my finger wet with spittle. I have two pots and I eat and excrete from both pots. Dish and pot, dish and pot and these arc the poles. In the beginning, a woman came into the room and inquired about my needs and wants. I succeeded in getting into her head, understanding her needs and my wants, but it was not easy and she did not understand the terms, accents, that fit her. Eventually, the woman got me a long stick with a hook attached to one end that allows me to control the furthest recesses of my abode. The woman is an old woman and I believe her to be even older than I.
The character in the room has a gaunt hand and part of a sleeve, suggesting that she has passed away. The character believes that when she came into the room for the room, she came in for her as well. She does not call for separate study. She believes that the character may have moved out of compassion or affection for her. She doesn't know how long she has been in this room, but she knows that she was very old before she found herself here. She refers to herself as an octogenarian, although she can't prove it. She knows the year of her birth, but doesn't remember it.
My body is impotent and has no power. I can exert a certain force, but I find it hard to guide them. I tremble a little, but only a little. I lie on my back, prostrate, supine, with my cheek on the pillow and my cheek resting on the bedstead. My sight and hearing are very bad, I have very bad eyesight and I can only open my eyes to see the sky and smoke of mankind. My senses are trained on me, me, and I am no prey for the senses. I am far from the sounds of blood and breath, immured and I feel nothing.
The man's name is Saposcat, like his father's. His friends call him Sapo. Sapo was a precocious boy who was not good at his school lessons and attended his classes with his mind elsewhere or blank, preferring to manipulate concrete numbers. He was the eldest child of poor and sickly parents who often heard them talk about what they ought to do in order to have better health and more money. His father was a salesman and Sapo's father worked as a salesman in a company where Sapo worked.
Mr. Saposcat works in a shop during the evenings and on the Saturday after- noon. His health is poor but not so poor that he can't work in the evenings of the week and the Saturday afternoon. He needs to find work for secretarial work of some kind. His wife suggests that if he does any more work, he might fall ill, which would make it ill for him to work on the Sunday. Mr. Sapo is concerned about the high price of manure, which he believes prevents him from supporting his family in greater com- fort. He suggests to his wife that he might grow vegetables as they cost less to buy and are less expensive.
The Saposcat family lives in a cramped house and save money on doctor's fees and chemist's bills. They are planning to move to a cottage in the country where they could afford to buy it in cartloads. The Saposats have a first-born child who is of her province and they are discussing the age of the child.
Mr. Saposcat took over the erroneous figure, murmuring it over and over to himself as if it were a question of the rise in price of an indispensable commodity, such as butcher’s meat. Mr. Sapo looked at his father's face and was sad, astonished, loving, disappointed, and con- fident in spite of all the years he brooded. He expressed regret that his son was not more eager to contribute to the place and prepare for his examinations. His wife advised him to focus on preparing his examinations and not his son's salary. They had no conversation properly speaking, using only spoken word.
Mr. Saposcat is committed to a liberal profession and believes he should not be unfitted for it. His wife sees him as a doctor for preference and sees him more as a surgeon. He will look after his wife and family when they are old. Mr. Sapo has a certain disease, but it is not definite.
Sapo was a solitary character who had no friends and was on good terms with his little friends, who did not love him. Sapo was a skilled boxer and wrestler, was fleet of foot, sneered at his teachers and sometimes gave impertinent answers, and often spent his free time in school doing impositions and often didn't get home before eight o’clock at night. When his master threatened him with a cane, Sapo snatched it from his hand and threw it out of the window, which was closed due to winter.
Sapo was supposed to be expelled. However, Sapo was not expelled when he deserved to be. Sapo is a plump rosy boy with thick wrists and ankles, which made his mother say that one day he would be even bigger than his father. I have not been able to find out why Sapo wasn't expelled, but I have decided to leave the question open. I want to put a safe remove between Sapo and the darkness in his story. I intend to make him live as though he had been punished according to his deserts.
Sapo has a big round head with a stiff, straight hair and flaxen hair. Sapo is described as having a remarkable head and his teachers are irritated by their failure to get anything out of it. His father has predicted that Sapo will astonish his family one day. His eyes are palest blue and his wife suggests he should be just a shade lighter. Saposcat loves nature and takes an interest in animals and plants, but he doesn't know how to look at them and is unable to distinguish one crop from another.
Samuel BECKETT is a man who enjoys the flight of a hawk and can distinguish it from all others. Michaelmas is a time of year when he appreciates the wonders of the natural world. Samuel is unaware of the sun, the moon, the planets, and the stars, but he finds joy from his ignorance of them. Samuel BecketT is fascinated by extremes of need, pride, patience, and solitude, and finds the hawk's flight a source of great pleasure.SAMUEL has a light that has just gone on in one of the two windows of the house across the way, one of which he can always see always.
The man has not yet returned home. The man has demanded certain movements of his legs and even feet and has lived with the dogs for a period of time. The dogs are old dogs who can't spring after the man when he sets out with his stick at dawn, so they stay in their kennel or basket and listen to the steps of the man. Sapo, the dog, is a companion to the man, and the man is sad about his old companion. Eventually, the pure air and the sun console the man and he thinks no more about Sapo until evening, when the lights in his house welcome him home and a feeble barking makes him decide it's time to destroy Sapo. 1 is going to rummage through her possessions and put her head under the blankets.
Mr. Saposcat is a boy who has been brooding on thoughts of sex since the age of 16. His father views him as a prey to the first flutters of sex. His wife sees him as earning his living. Mr. Sapo's teachers see his brooding as signs of besottedness pure and simple. His dream is less of girls than of himself, his own life, and his life to be. MALONE DIES 193 Mr Sapo is easily frightened of gull's eyes, which remind him of an old ship-wreck.
The character has not learned the art of thinking and struggles with doubts, desires, imaginings, fears, and dreads. If he had been less well-endowed with strength and courage, he would have abandoned and despaired of ever knowing what manner of being he was and lived blindly in a mad world, in the midst of strangers. His studies take up most of his time and he is always last in his classes. His father, Mr. Saposcat, believes that his son is the victim of lascivious speculations and suggests that he should play more games. The character is fond of walking in the country and believes that the long walks do him good.
Sapo is a patient, reasonable child who has struggled alone for years to shed a little light upon himself. Sapo is a stranger to the joys of darkness and is fond of light. Adrian, Sapo's mother, expresses concern that Sapo has hurt his feelings. Adrian is getting along well with Sapo and is getting on with him. Adrian wants to be there a 194 SAMUEL BECKETT little before the plunge, to close for the last time the old hatch on top of him and say goodbye to the holds where he has lived and his refuge. Adrian has always been sentimental, but now he has time to frolic, ashore, in the brave company he has longed for and always searched for. Adrian believes the game is won, he has lost all the games he has played until now.
In the summer holidays, Mr. Saposcat took private lessons during the morning and left the house in the afternoon to work in the open air. Once clear of the town, he hid his books under a stone and worked in the countryside. It was the season when the labours of the peasants reach their paroxysm and the long bright days are too short for all there is to do. The peasants often took advantage of the moon to make a last journey between the fields and the threshing floor, or to overhaul the machines and get them ready for the impending dawn. Mr.
Sapo is a character in a story about a character named Malone. 195 Malone has a history of watching people come and go, feeling boredom and terrorized by their presence. 195 Sapo has tried to kill, take their place, or flee from them, but eventually decides to stop everything and wait for the end of the story. 195Malone was born grave as others syphilitic and was born with a disease of earnestness, resulting in him being born grave and gravely ill.
I struggled to be grave, to live, to invent, and to try and live without knowing what it was I was trying to achieve. And gravely I struggled to escape into the darkness, seeking sanctuary and solace in the shadows. I began again, but this time with a different aim: to live and cause to live. Nuance is what I sought when I struggled out of my hole and aloft through the stinging air towards an inaccessible boon.
 SAMUEL BECKETT cern is not with him but with another person, a person far beneath him, whom he admires and envies. Samuel has often made others suffer and been made to suffer by him, and he has suffered every time he left him. Samuel feels that he is forgetting himself again and is trying to forget about his past. He feels he can never tell the past of himself or others, as he has never tried to do so. SamUel is on the point of vanishing at the same time as the stranger, and by the same grace, he has managed to live long enough to feel other eyes behind his closed eyes.
The character is depicted as a character who often stops abruptly and goes off into a new direction, often in unexpected directions. The character moves like a big thistle-down plucked by the wind from the place where it had settled. There is a choice of images in the story of the character's actions: he stops, stands for a moment, and then starts off again. I have rummaged through my things, sorting them out and drawing them over to me to look at them. I initially thought that I knew these objects by heart and could speak of them without looking at them without consulting them. However, I now realize that the image of these objects, with which I had lulled myself until now, was accurate but not completely accurate. I want to be in a position to make a statement about these objects without any approximativeness and to be free from any trace of approximation.
MALONE DIES 197 is a story about an obsession. The story takes place in a room where there is only one piece of furniture capable of intervening between the protagonist and objects, a cupboard. The cupboard is cleaved to the wall and the two walls and seems to be part of them, as it stands in the entrance of the room. The protagonist has a button-boot, a kind of boot, in the cupboard, but it is empty and she finds other objects of less value, among them a zinc ring that sho’je like silver, which she thought she had preserved.
I don't remember ever having smoked a tobacco-pipc, but I remember a soap-pipe with which I used to blow bubbles as a child. I have a number of treasures that are derived from the same source, including a little packet tied up in age-yellowed newspaper that reminds me of something. I drew the packet over beside the bed and felt it with the knob of my stick and found it soft and light, better than if it had touched the thing directly. I resolved not to undo the packet and sent it back into the corner. I will speak of it again when the time comes. 198 SAMUEL BECKETT tells a story about a time when nature smiles and shines, the rack lets loose its black unforgettable cohorts and sweeps away the blue for
My situation is delicate and I fear that I might miss out on important things due to fear, fear of falling back into an old error, and fear of not finishing /n time. I have a deep thought which has been nagging at me for the past five minutes. My deep thought is that the unchanging seeks relief from its formlessness. I ask that the last of mine, as long as it lasts, should have living for its theme. If it begins to run short of life, I will feel it. My body is not yet ready to make up its mind, but I fancy it weighs heavier on the bed, flattens and flattens.
The room is filled with the sound of the night sky and the wind. Kaspar David Friedrich loved a night like this one, tempestuous and bright, with clouds scud and tattered by the wind, and a limpid ground. The name of Kaspar is a name that comes back to Kaspar, and it brings back memories of him and the names he has given to this night sky. The moon is too far away for Kaspar to see, but he has the patience to wait for it. The wind is strong and the words and images run riot in Kaspar's head, chasing, flying, clashing, merging, and merging
The characters have a kind of rhythm and a tune, and their eyes are bluish in color. They are almost facing the wrong way, almost like a bird's, and they have a pillow in their mouth. The characters are buried in the world and they know they will find their place there one day. They have a strong desire to leave their happiness and return to the race of men, who come and go, often with burdens. They leave the light, the fields they longed to love, and the sky filled with white clouds.
The story is about a family, the Lamberts, who struggle to make ends meet. The family consists of a man, a woman, two children, a boy and a girl, and the father, known as Big Lambert, who is also known as "Big Lambert". Big Lambert has a third or fourth marriage and is still with his young cousin. Big Lambert is known as a big man and has a reputation for being a bleeder and disjointer of pigs. The father has other children who helped him, each one according to their means or the humour of 200 SAMUEL BECKETT.
Big Lambert is a man who works for a lower fee than the butcher's and is known to demand no more in return for his services than a lump of gammon or a pig’s cheek. Big Lambert often speaks of his father with respect and tenderness, expressing his belief that his father's like will not be seen again once he is gone. His days fall in December and January and February, and he waits impatiently for the return of the Saviour's birth, the principal event of which he believes is unquestionably the birth in a stable. He carries under his arm, in their case, the great knives whetted before the fire the night before, and in his pocket, apron wrapped in paper, the apron destined to protect his Sunday suit while he works. He has a strong desire to go to a distant homestead where he believes the Savior's birth will take place, and his old heart exults at the thought that he is still needed despite his age and his methods preferred to those of younger men. He often reaches home late at night drunk and exhausted from the long road and emotions of the journey.
Lambert has just dispatched a pig and for days afterwards he could not speak of anything but the pig. Lambert's family feared him because they feared him. Lambert was feared and in a position to do as he pleased, and his young wife had abandoned all hope of bringing him to heel by means of her cunt, the trump card of young wives. Lambert made life easy for his wife by making things easy for him, often in ways that often appeared to her exorbitant. Lambert threatened to beat his wife if she did not open up to him, and at the least show of rebellion, he would run to the wash-house and come back with the battle and beat her until she came round to a better way of thinking. Lambert continued to talk about the pig he had just dispatched and the affliction of his family. Lambert has been summoned to slaughter another pig, a
Lambert's farm is located in a hollow, flooded in winter and burnt to a cinder in summer and lies on a fine meadow that belongs to other peasants living at a distance. Lambert's son, or heir, is a great strapping lad with terrible teeth. Big Lambert has a gift for sticking pigs, but this gift is of no help to him when rearing them, and his own pig rarely exceeded nine stone. Lambert has long-standing fears for his pigs, fearing the thinning effects of exercise and the effects of daylight.
Sapo, a blind and lean pig, had tied the legs of a weak pig and killed it indignantly without haste, upbraiding it for ingratitude. Sapo blamed himself for the pig's ingratiation and blamed it for being coddled by him. Samuel Beckett used to count up to three hundred, four hundred, and with other things such as the showers, the bells, the chatter of the sparrows, and other things for no reason, for the sake of counting, and then divided by sixty to measure time. Samuel Beckett once used to devour the world, but he no longer devoured the world as he gets on. Sam
The 4 voman is engaged in a frantic, frantic task with very little time and very few hands. The 4voman is unable to support her own weight and has to throw her arms about in a way that is difficult to describe and not easy to understand. The movements resemble those of an arm shaking a duster or a rag to rid it of dust. There are only four or five fingers at the end of each arm, instead of the usual five, and her hands are limp and empty. Her hair is thin, grey, grey and dirty, her face is pale and thin, and she has thin, thin, pale skin.
Sapo is a person who gives way to others, giving way to them, within doors and without. Sapo is the last of all the MALONE DIES 203 living as likely as not and dead to what is going on about her. She has the ability to drop everything she was doing and start gesticulating, causing her to cry out and gesticulate, indicating that she is disturbed or disturbed by something or someone. She often stops whatever she is doing and resumes or sets about some new task, usually resuming or resuming it after stopping. It was summer and Sapo was alone, by the window, with a bowl of goat’s milk on the table. The room was dark in spite of the door and window open on the great outer light.
Sapo is in a room filled with the sounds of those at work, the daughter calling to her goats, the father cursing his mule, and the father's mule. Sapo feels a sense of relief when he perceives the silence, which he describes as the heart of the dark, the silence of dust and things that would never stir if left alone. The ticking of the invisible alarm-clock serves as the voice of that silence which he believes will one day triumph and all things will be at rest. He brings few poor gifts and lays them on the table before he leaves the room. Before Sapo leaves, a hen, possibly a grey hen, takes advantage of the open door and ventures into the room, causing Sapo to feel reassured and reassured.
The grey hen often comes alone and is followed by a second, third, or even a fourth hen, all bearing little resemblance to one another in plumage and entasis. Sometimes the grey hen comes alone, or one of the grey liens if you prefer. The grey hens are silent at first, but gradually start to scratch and cluck for contentment and relax their soughing feathers. In order to determine whether there is only one grey hen or more than one, it is necessary for someone to be present when all the hens come running towards Mrs. Lambert as she cries for help.
Sapo spent long hours in an old kitchen during which he observed a big, anxious, ashen bird, who was about to be sent flying with a broom and angry cries, and a long line of tattered MALONE DIES 205 washing, swaying and drying in the sun. Sapo felt sorry that he did not understand the importance of the hours he spent in the old kitchen, which were spent waiting to be on his feet again and in motion, and while waiting noted many things, including the bird and the well.
Sapo, often unnoticed, often goes on a strange walk and often stops and starts, often going through mud. Sapo leaves the Lamberts often without saying goodbye and leaves them unbothered, unrepentant, as they knew he meant no harm. However, when Sapo left, they found a crumpled paper-bag containing a few articles of haberdashery and a bowl of goat’s milk on the kitchen-table, which they found to be useful and delicate presents.
They are able to identify individuals who pass along a remote road with a distance of less than a mile, and to divine their intentions and whereabouts. They communicate with one another by communicating through gestures or exchanging signals. They have the ability to observe events and share their knowledge about them with each other. 206 SAMUEL BECKETT was seen moving away unseen, even in the deep shadow of the trees that bordered the stream, and they watched him as he went.
Sapo and the other characters in the story share a common bond of feeling a sense of curiosity and curiosity about each other's feelings. Sapo's character is described as grave and expressionless, with a slight smile and a rictus, and his face always grave or expressionless. The character has a dream where he stumbles away from a meadow, passing from light to shadow, from shadow to light, and eventually stopping due to a voice telling him to do so. When Sapo stops, he is blind to the beauty and utility of the earth and the wild many-coloured flowers happy among the crops and weeds, but these stations are short-lived as he is still young.
The sound I liked best was the barking of the dogs, particularly in the clusters of hovels up in the hills where stone-cutters lived. The dogs of the valley responded to the barking with their gross bay all fangs and jaws and foam, and from the hills another joy came from the brief scattered lights that sprang up on their slopes at nightfall, brighter than the stars and less bright than the moon.
I have yellow hair, yellowed by wax and lack of care, with yellowed yellow ears, and a long, hidden lobes. I have a high window which I use as a viewing platform from which I can see two impetuous tufts of yellow hair from which there are yellow ears. I used to be deaf, but for a long time I have been hearing things confusedly, as if the noises of the world had merged into a single noise and all I heard was one vast continuous buzzing. I suspect that I have lost the ability to decompose the noises and perceive them as one continuous buzzing noise. I would attribute part of my disordered sense to this disordered
 SAMUEL BECKETT is in a hurry and has a short memory. He has decided not to say anything that is not false, which means nothing that is calculated to leave him in doubt about his intentions. Samuel has a history of forgetting what he had said and often forgets what he has said. SamUEL has written about himself with the same pencil and in the same exercise-book as he used to write about SamuEL. He knows practically nothing about Samuel's family, but he knows there is a record of it somewhere, which is the only way to keep an eye on him.
It is not me, but another person whose life is just beginning and who has his own chronicle, his memories, his reason, and is capable of recognizing the good in the bad, the bad in the worst, and being able to grow gently old and die one day like any other day, only shorter. It is dark and I can't see anything, I can barely see the window-pane or the wall forming with sharp contrasts. I hear the noise of my little finger as it glides over the paper and the different sound of the pencil, which surprises me and makes me think that something must have changed. I also hear a choir, a song I know, but I don't know how to play it, and it goes on inside me but not together with mine.
The song is being played by a woman who has been singing the same song for a long time. The song belongs to the long past and has uttered for the last time the triumphal cry on which the song ends. It seems to be Easter Week, which coincides with the return of the Seasons. I have the feeling of being deceived by the song, possibly by children. I believe the song is dedicated to the honour and glory of the first person who was the first to rise from the dead, referred to in the song as "MALONE DIES 209". I feel as if I have fallen asleep and can't find my exercise-book, but I still have the pencil in my hand. I fear I must have fallen and have to wait for day to break until then.
I have been having a conversation with a person for over a week and have been repeating a certain phrase, "I shall soon be quite dead at last," which seems familiar to me. I seem to have written this phrase before, or spoken it, word for word, and it seems to have familiarity with the previous phrase. I have a plan to live, and cause to live and die, and to play and play at last and die alive. I fear nothing, and the dawn was not as slow in coming as I had feared. I saw the pane shiver before the ghastly sunrise, which brings me sunset and sunrise. The exercise-book had fallen to the ground and I found it under the bed. I had to harpoon it to recover it and hope it will see me out.
I found an exercise-book on the day I needed it. I rummaged through my possessions in the hope of finding it. It is ruled in squares and covered with ciphers, symbols, diagrams, and symbols and phrases. Calculations on the first pages seem to stop abruptly, indicating that it is astronomy or astrology. I did not look closely at the first page, drawing a line and writing, "Soon I shall be quite dead at last," without going on to the next page, which was blank. The pencil I used is an old acquaintance and has five faces, pointed at both ends, and is very short. I hope it will see me.
The character Saposcat has a deep-seated doubt about the natural order of things and is unable to grasp what order is meant. She has pinned her faith to appearances, believing them to be vain. She believes that she has never seen any sign of any divine presence inside her or outside her and has never experienced any signs of divine intervention. She is not averse to departing from herself, but she is less willing to depart willingly. She waited for the dawn and watched for the window, giving in to her pains and impotence. She thought for a second that she was going to have a visit. The summer holidays were drawing to a close and the decisive moment was at hand when the hopes reposed in Sapo were to be fulfilled or dashed to the ground. Mr. Sapo is trained to a hair, said Mr.
The Saposcats believe that a more or less normal if unintelligent youth, once admitted to the study of these pro- fessions, is almost certain to be certified, sooner or later, apt to MALONE DIES 211 exercise them. Mr. Saposcat sold himself a fountain-pen, at a dis- count of A Bird, and promised to give it to him on the morning of the ex- amination. His wife advised him to let him have the pen the day before to give him time to get used to the nib.
Mr. Saposcat has a medium nib pen, a medium size, which he believes will suit his son if he gets it. The pen is in a box with a yellow beak agape and adorned with a bird's beak. Mr. Sapo is not pleased with the medium nib and initially objects to giving the pen to his son immediately, arguing that his son would have time to get used to it and compare it with the pens of his less im- poverished friends, who are more familiar with its defects. Mrs. Sap
Sapo arrived at the farm earlier than usual and was surprised to see his father's big red and white head in a hole or pit he had dug for his dead mule. The mule had died during the night. Edmund came out of the house and joined his father in the hole. Sapo saw the mule’s black corpse lying on its side, with forelegs pointed towards heaven and hind legs drawn up under the belly. Edmund and his father, Lambert, used a pick, shovel, and spade to dig the hole and pulled the body into it. Lambert then went back to the house to fill up the hole with his spade.
Edmund was working on a spade and felt a great calm. Sapo sat down before him, laid his hand on the table and rested his head on his hand, thinking he was alone. Louis began to talk and seemed in good spirits. Edmund had bought a mule two years before on its way to the slaughter-house. The mule, in his opinion, had died of old age. Lambert had predicted that the mule would drop down dead at the first ploughing after the transaction. Lambert is a con-noisseur of mules and considers the eye to be the most important part of the transaction in the case of such matters. Lambert was able to convince the mules to continue to serve in the
Lambert has a mule which is covered with sores and has done ten miles. Lambert has been trying to get the mule for two years. The mule has a history of senile sores. Lambert thought he might screw six months out of his mule and two years out of him. Lambert and his son sat at a table in the gloom, talking and listening to each other, far removed from each other. Edmund stopped often to rest, leaning on a spade and looking about him. The heap of earth was dwindling and glowing strangely in the evening light, glowing in patches as though with its own fires. Lambert went to the slaughter-house, where he buys his beasts, to buy a loafer.
Edmund and his mother passed each other by in silence as they passed a neighbour to borrow a pound of lentils for their supper. 214 SAMUEL BECKETT passed without a glance and there was nothing to suggest that he had seen them. 214 Edmund's mother was thinking of the handsome steelyard that weighed lentils and wondered if it was true. 214 She lit a lamp where it stood at its usual place on the chimney-piece, beside an alarm- clock and a crucifix. 214 The lamp and crucifix were placed in the middle of a triangle, with the lamp and the lamp being the lowest of the three.
Sapo is a character who appears in a scene where a yellow globe is defaced and there is a hole in the wick of a lamp. Sapo is portrayed as a character named Big Lambert. When Sapo was absent, the light from the lamp went out and the outer world went out. When she saw Sapo, she initially thought he was her daughter, but her thoughts flew to the absent one. She set the lamp on the table and began to sort lentils into two piles, creating a heap of lentils that grew larger and smaller until she annihilated it in less than two or three minutes. She went away and returned with a saucepan and emptied lentils from the table into the saucepan, which she used to annihilate the heap.
Sapo was engaged in a tedious and futile task of sorting lentils. Sapo could have gone on sorting her lentils all night and never achieved her purpose, which was to free them from all admixture. However, Sapo decided to stop in the middle of the task because it was the wisest thing to do, discouraged but not to undo all the work she had already done. If Sapo's purpose, in sorting the lentils, was to rid them of only the greater part of lentils and not all of the other parts, what then? Sapo doesn't know if the tasks are finished or if there are other tasks, other days, of which she can safely say that they are finished. She came back holding a lamp high and a littie to one side and a white rabbit by the hindlegs.
Lions and pigeons have the ability to escape from a hutch and strike a corpse. They have time to do so while being taken out of the hutch, often by the ears and disposed in the most convenient position to receive the blow. Hens have more stubborn livers and have been observed to cut off their own heads before collapsing. Pigeons are less impression-able and struggle before choking to death. Mrs. Lambert and Sapo, Lambert's son, entered the kitchen and sat at the table, their eyes averted from each other's eyes, waiting for Lambert's decision. Lambert declared that he would kill Whitey the next day.
Edmund is a character who has been tasked by Big Lambert to fetch the 216 SAMUEL BECKETT case containing the three knives, three in number, which he can use to kill Blackey. His wife and son disapprove of his actions. Mrs. Lambert went back to the door, listened, called, and waited for the flock to respond, but it was a long time before she arrived. After the meal, Edmund went up to bed to masturbate before his sister joined him. Edmund would have slept with his sister, but she was not eager and she was still young.
Lambert is the only member of the household who has no desire to sleep with anybody. Lambert's daughter went out alone with him and was crouched before the range in a state of dejection. Lambert told her to eat the remains of a rabbit out of a pot, which she did so with a spoon. Lambert watched his daughter eat the rabbit, but he noticed that she was engaged in another activity, such as bringing the spoon up from the pot into her mouth and down from her mouth into the pot again. Lambert expressed his intention to kill Whitey, and offered to hold her if she wants. Lambert saw his daughter's sad state and went towards her to comfort her. Lambert had plans to go on for another ten years, but decided to try and go on a little longer, focusing his thoughts elsewhere.
Mrs. Lambert was alone in the kitchen when she was writing the story. She was reading a story about the Lamberts, a family who lived in a ruinous old house. The story takes place in a place called Malone Dies 217, which is described as a place of ruins and ruins. Mrs. Lambert has a history of toil and toiliness, and her mind wanders away from this place, wandering among its ruins. When she was alone, she sat down by the window and turned down the wick of the lamp before blowing it out because she did not like to Mow out a lamp that was still hot. Once the lamp was cooled, she stood up and blew down the chimney. She stood for a moment, bowed forward, and bowed her hands on the table before sitting back down again.
She has been living in the same house for five or six years. She has a woman's disease, which she believes to be caused by stress. The house is surrounded by a kitchen where she serves her family, which helps her cope with the daily tribulations of living there. The table at which her family will soon be united, waiting for her to serve them, and the pots and pans are ready for use. The moon was gone and the stars were shining, a scene that sometimes solaced her. She went to the well and grasped the chain, but the bucket was at the bottom and the windlass locked. Her mind was a press of formless questions, some of which related to her daughter, who was lying sleepless in her bed, listening to her mother moving about. It was only the next 218 SAMUEL BECKETT day, or the day after, that she decided to tell her what Sapo had told her about him going away and not coming back.
I took counsel from an Israelite on the subject of conation when I was looking for someone to be faithful to and for me to be loyal to. I can see him Siill, the Israelite, having a fit of laughter and wiping his eyes and mouth, and I, myself, with welted trousers and a pool of urine at my feet. The Israelite's name was Jackson. Jackson had a pink and grey parrot, which he tried to teach to say "Nihil in intellects etc." but the bird managed to learn only the first three words, which annoyed Jackson. I have no further use for Jackson.
Polly was in a cage with many features, including perches, swings, trays, troughs, stairs, and cuttle-bones. Jackson called Polly the merino, possibly because of the French expression merino. Polly's relationship with Jackson was short-lived and Jackson found Polly disgusting. Polly tried to find a kindred spirit among the inferior races, red, yellow, and chocolate. Polly also tried to interact with the plague-stricken, but she failed due to their ease of access. Polly had a fondness for old people, particularly crying babies.
I am stuck in a situation where I feel impotent and feel like I am in chains. If I had the use of my body, I would throw something out of the window. Unfortunately, I do not know what floor I am on, possibly on the mezzanine. The noises of banging, steps on the stairs, and noises in the street have not enlightened me on my location. I know that the living are above me and beneath me and that I am not in a basement. I sometimes see the sky and other windows facing it through my window. I believe that I might be in a kind of vault and that the space which I take to be the street in reality is only a wide trench or ditch with other vaults opening upon it.
SAMUEL BECKETT believes that there are people coming and going and conversing in their house and multitudes of fine babies, particularly of late, whose parents keep moving about from one place to another to prevent them from forming a habit of motionlessness. SAMUEL believes that they are preparing their babies for a day when they will have to move about unai ded.SAMU ELIZABETT has no proof that the noises that he hears come from below and the steps that he says come climbing towards him are real, which makes him hesitate to conclude that he is a prey to hallucinations. SAM
I have been having trouble for some time past and feel that my troubles were nearly over. However, my horse-sense suggests that I have not yet reached the end of my troubles and that I am still struggling with various issues related to my possessions, my system of nutrition and elimin- ation, the environment, the couple across the way, the changing sky, and possibly my worms. I find the light that reigns in the den to be bizarre and I enjoy a kind of night and day, often in a different way from the way to which I was accustomed before I found myself here.
MALONB DIES 221 ienced. The light turned out to be the dusk and the sun, instead of rising higher and higher in the sky, calmly set, and night, which I had just celebrated after the passing of, calmly fell again. I confess to never having experienced this phenomenon before. I have pleasured night to fall all the livelong day and day to break all the night, but I have never experienced it. I feel it is my duty to say that it is never light in this place, never really light. The air sparkles, the granite wall across the way glitters with all its mica, and the light is against my window but it doesn't come through.
The light is as bright under my bed as it is under the ceiling. There is no colour in this place except for a kind of grey incandescence, which I consider to be a colour. I have no objection to referring to grey as a colour, and I am open to the idea that grey and black are related. I was going to say according to the time of day, but it does not seem to depend on the time. I myself am very grey and sometimes have the feeling that I emit grey, the same way as my sheets. My night is not the sky's, and my space is not visited by the luminaries I sometimes see shining afar.
There is a light from the outer world, which seems to be the light of those who know the sun and moon emerge at such an hour and dive again below the surface and rely on this knowledge. There is also the light from those who rely on clouds, who know that clouds are always to be expected and that they will eventually disappear. The light from this world has its alternations, its dusks and dawns, and it seems to have lived out there once. My own light source is limited to artificial 222 S AMU EL BECKETT light, like the couple across the way. I can't make light without a lamp or a torch, and I don't know if the air in this place lends itself to combustion. The noises, cries, steps, doors, murmurs, and noises cease for whole days.
It seems to me that I am in a head, with an arc of solid bone that encloses a six-plane structure. However, the head is not mine, but a kind of air circulates in the head, and I can hear it beating against the walls and being beaten back by waves and other onslaughts. The sound of these waves can be interpreted as a faint sound of aerial surf or a sudden storm, similar to the cries of the children, the dying, and the lovers, which in my innocence I say cease, whereas in reality they never cease. The skull is not a vacuum, and if I close my eyes, as others can't, I can sometimes be caught up in the swirling eddies created by the air currents. Fortunately, the soul within the skull can be veiled.
I lost my pencil after trying to retrieve it for forty-eight hours. My pencil is a little Venus-shaped with five or six facets, pointed at both ends and so short there's just room between them for my thumb and two adjacent fingers. What mv stick lacks is a prehensile proboscis like the nocturnal tapir’s. I think that if I lose my pencil more often, it might improve my mood and make me more cheerful. I have spent two uneventful days of which nothing will ever be known. MALONE DIES 223 brought me the solution and conclusion of the whole sorry business of Malone (since that is what I am called now).
I have a pencil that I use frequently and I use it frequently. The lead of the pencil is hard and would leave no trace if I wrote too lightly. I use a yellow, yellow, sharp and brittle lead and I have nails which are long, yellow and sharp. I have another pencil made in France, a long cylinder with a soft fat lead, which I keep in the bed with me somewhere. My pencil is getting weaker by the day and I worry about its durability. Recently, while hunting for my pencil, I made a curious discovery: the floor is whitening and I struck it several blows with a stick and the sound it gave forth was sharp and dull.
The sand kept trickling away and I thought to myself that the pencil was gone for ever. I noticed that all the superficies, horizontal and perpendicular, had visibly blanched since my last examination of them dating from 224 SAMUEL BECKBTT not when. I believe that things in general darken as time wears on, with the exception of mortal remains and certain parts of the body which lose their natural colour and fade in the long run. I also noticed a gleam and shimmering as of bones within the confines of the gloom, which was not previously the case. I fear that there is more light here now that I know what is going on.
I remember the paper-hangings or wall-paper still clinging in places to the walls and covered with a writhing mass of roses, violets, and other flowers, which was unlike anything I had ever seen before in my life. However, these flowers are now completely gone from the ceiling, leaving only cupids. I remember a moment when my exercise-book, almost a child's, fell to the ground and I recovered it by slipping the hook of my stick into one of the rents in the cover and hoist- ing it gently towards me. During this time, a series of incidents and mishaps took place in my head, causing me to believe that all was streaming and emptying away as though through a sluice, to my great joy.
1 MALONE DIES 225 is a person who has always groped and whose every move has always been a kind of groping, and whose motionlessness is also a groping. Therefore, she has greatly groped stockstill, and her movements have always been akin to groping stockstill. She has always believed that she has grasped the true nature of her absurd tribulations, but she was deceived into thinking she had grasped it finally. She is not reproachful of her actions, despite her belief that it is easy and beautiful and that all will grow dark again. She sees her particles being removed grain by grain until they trickle back into the same place, reminiscent of a hand playing with them.
I have experienced many strange and baseless things, some of which are better left unsaid. I have gone liquid and become like mud at times and others when I would be lost in the eye of a needle and hard and contracted. I was speaking then was I not of my little pastimes and thoughts about contenting myself with them instead of launching forth on all this ballsaching poppycock about life and death. I had a private idea about the subject when I began, but it went out of my head and I would have held my peace if it hadn't begun.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has a brainwave to live long enough to get acquainted with free carbonic gas, which has always been his dream. He is an old foetus, hoar and impotent, his mother is done for, and his father is at a party. He believes he will land head-foremost in the charnel-house. He has always dreamed of getting a job and having a good job and a good life. His dreams have always been tied together with many strings and never a shaft, and he believes that he will never get bom and never get dead. If he tells of the other who is his little one,
I was born and lived a long life and met Jackson. I have wandered in towns, the woods and wildernesses, walked in the seas, islands and peninsulas, seen the brief yellow lights of man and the great white and coloured beams of light from caves, crouched on the sand in the lee of the rocks with the smell of seaweed and wet rock and the howling of the wind, and walked on the beach softly clawing the shingle. I was not happy, wishing the night would never end and morning would never come when men wake and say, "We’ll soon be dead, let's make the most of it." Regardless of whether I was born, lived, or merely died, I will continue doing as I have always done, not knowing what it is I do, nor who I am nor where I am, nor if I am. I will try and make a little creature in my image.
I have found him again after a long time, but I don't know how I did it. I ran him down in the heart of the town and found him sitting on a bench in the middle of a park, sitt ; ng on a park bench. I slip into him in the hope of learning something, but before I am done I will find traces of what was before I find him. I know he is male and living with that evening life which is like a convalescence, if my memories are mine. I remember the days of the underground railway and the scavenging for warmth and reasonably edible scraps.
There was a time in my life when the bakers were often indulgent, at close of day and baking-apples were often available, and I was a great man for apples, providing shelter, sunshine and shelter for those who needed them. But suddenly all begins to rage and roar again and you find yourself lost in forests of high threshing ferns or wind-swept wastes, wondering if you have not died without knowing and gone to hell or been born again into an even worse place. There was a man who was found on a bench, dressed as follows: a greatcoat, well-made and well-groomed, with only fifteen buttons set at intervals of three or four inches.
The character 228 SAMUEL BECKETT is wearing a coat with a fringe that ends in a fringe. inside the coat, the feet are partially hidden by the material. 228 SAMMEL BERTETT's posture is stiff and set, like that of the Colossus of Memnon, the dearly loved son of Dawn, and his posture is similar to that of a Colossus. 228SAMUEL has a posture similar to the Colossus, with a stiff, set posture and the tails of his coat sweeping the ground and rustling like a train when he walks. 228 Samuel's coat has a large rag arc of a piece with sleeves that are of velvet or shag, and the sleeves are frayed and frayed, but the collar has remained intact.
The coat is of a fine plain green colour, what you might call cab green. There used to be cabs and carriages rattling through the town with panels of a handsome bottle green, and I have seen them myself and driven in them. The coat is described as an overcoat or cover-me-down, suggesting that it was once a greatcoat or overcoat. It gives the impression that the coat covers the whole body all over, with the exception of the head which emerges, lofty and impassive, clear of its embrace. The buttons of the coat are of wooden cylinders, two or three inches long, with a hole in the middle for the thread, and the buttons are not genuine buttons.
The lappets MALONE DIES 229 are roughly two and a half inches long. The material of the coat is felt and the various dints and bulges inflicted upon it by the spasms and contortions of the body persist long after the fit is past. The hat is as hard as iron, superbly domed above its narrow guttered rim, and marred by a wide crack or rent extending from the crown down and intended to facilitate the introduction of the skull. However, unlike the coat, the hat is too small and attached by a string to the topmost button on the coat for safety. Its colour is a shade of buff and pearl grey and it verges on black.
The hat once belonged to a sporting gentleman who was a turf-man or breeder of rams. The coat and the hat were bought at the same place, possibly the same day and possibly by the same tailor. The hat and the coat were bought by fine handsome men, six foot tall and over, but with a small head due to over-breeding. Sapo is no longer referred to as Sapo.
Macmann has been sitting under a surtout since morning and has been there since evening. 230 SAMUEL BECKETT for Macmann is not much better but there is no time to lose and Macmann might be stark staring naked under the surtouts for all anyone to see. 230 Macmann's back is turned to the river and he does not stir, but he is aware of the tugs, the black funnels striped with red, that tow to their moorings the last barges, freighted with empty barrels, and the distant fires of the sunset, orange, rose, and green, quenching them in ruffles and then spreading them bright again. 230 The gulls that gather around the outflow of the sewers, opposite the Bellevue Hotel, are heard in paroxysms of hunger. 230 Samuel Beckett's face is towards the people that throng the streets at this hour, their long day ended and the long evening before them.
Even those who know themselves to be condemned to the same direction, even if they choose a different path, take leave of one another and part politely, with some polite excuse or without saying a word. They all know one another's little ways and are familiar with each other's paths. They walk side-by-side happily, side by side, and even muttering to each other, indicating a mutual understanding of each other’s little ways. At this hour, erotic craving accounts for the majority of couples, but these are few compared to the solitaries pressing forward through the throng, obstructing the access to places of amusement, bowed over the parapets, propped against vacant walls, and waiting for their appointed place.
The first stage of the journey is the journey of the horse, beginning with the journey to the rendezvous or the hotel or the destination. Then comes the journey home or to the hotel, where the comfortable bed is waiting for them. Then the journey takes the horse from its previous career as a pet horse, or a race-horse, to a pack-horse or a plough-horse. The horse spends most of its time standing still in an attitude of dejection, its head hanging as low as the shafts and harness permit, and its head almost to the cobble-stones. Once in motion, the horse is transformed momentarily by the memories that motion brings, possibly because of the memories it revives. When a fare has been taken on board or the carriage tilts up, the carriage's back-hand begins to gall its spine, indicating that the passenger has been seated facing the way he is going. The cabman is alone on his box ten feet from the ground, his knees covered at all seasons and in all weathers with a kind of rug originally brown.
The character of the character is described as a horse-riding character who is angry and frustrated with the lack of passengers. The passenger, having named the place he wants to go and feeling helpless to act on the course of events, is often unable to act due to a sense of helplessness. The character has the ability to tear the reins from his horse's back and launch his equipage blindly through the dark thronging streets of the city. Each passenger has his reasons for going to the appointed 232 SAMUEL BECKET
Macmann is observing a phenomenon where windows and shop- windows light up almost instantaneously after the setting sun depending on the season. According to Macmann, it is a true spring evening, an equinoctial gale howls along the quays bordered by high red houses and warehouses, and there are no trees, only old leaves whirling in the air. Macmann prefers summer to winter and prefers autumn to spring, whether it is spring or autumn.
He is in a place where he is unlikely to move again, but he has the whole of his old age ahead of him. There is an epilogue to his story which is not clear and does not add much to what has already been acquired or shed any light on its purpose. He will rise from this place and proceed by other places to another pjacc, and then by others still to yet another, and so on, on, for long years. In order to survive, one must come and go, and in order to do so, one needs to have someone who brings them food, like myself.
Macmann is concerned only with his ignorance of certain things, such as those that appal him. Macmann believes that ignorance is bad policy, as it adds to his pains. According to Macmann, on the fifth day, when the problem is how to rise, the fourth and third days do not matter, and the only consideration is whether to rise at all. In this scenario, Macmann has to drag himself to the nearest plot of vegetables, using tufts of grass and asperities of the earth, or to a clump of brambles.
He does not possess the means of accumulating enough food to keep him alive for more than three weeks or a month, and considers it a drop in a bucket compared to the whole of second childishness. Even if he did, he would not be able to employ them because he feels so far away from the future. He has waited a long time for something and feels as if he has waited for it in vain. SAMUEL BECKETT's eyes are red, worn, and hard set to meet, with four red lids, two for each eye. Samuel Beckett's eyes stare into the space before them, and at long intervals they close with a gentle suddenness, often without anger.
Lachrymal sees the heaven of the old dream, the sea and the earth, the spasms of the waves from shore to shore, and the different motion of men who are not tied together but are free to move around freely, making full use of their freedom. When one dies, the others continue on as if nothing had happened. Malone is sure of feeling that his hour is at hand and has felt it for a long time, even in the days when he felt it was past. Malone believes his stories are all in vain and that he is still alive and breathing in and out of the air.
The story takes place in two or three days, in the language of the days when they taught me the names of days and taught me how to tell the time. In this language, the days are few and seem like a joke to me. I believe I have reached the month of May, which I believe comes from Maia, the goddess of increase and plenty, and I believe that I have entered on the season of increasing and plenty. May is associated with the midsummer moon and the harvest, which comes later in the season. I am currently at All Saints in the middle of the chrysanthemums, where I will not hear them howling over their charnels this year.
I don't feel my feet any more, and I feel they arc beyond the range of the most powerful telescope. My feet are so far away that it would take me over a month to call them in to be cleaned. My fingers have the ability to write in other latitudes and the air that breathes through my pages and turns them without my knowledge when I doze off, causing the subject to fall far from the verb and the object land somewhere in the void.
When I was a virgin, the nozzle from which sperm and clouts and gouts of sperm came streaming and splashing into my face was a source of a con- tinuous flow. Now, as a result of uraemia, I would be dead of it. I do not expect to see my sex again, even with the naked eye. I have a certain expectation of never seeing it again. I believe that if I were to stand up again, my extremities would recede and I would fill a specific part of the universe.
I have 236 SAMUEL BECKETT stories to tell. I continue to fit in this room, let's call it a room, and I will fit in it as long as I need to. If I ever succeed in breathing my last, it will not be in the street, or in a hospital, but in the midst of my possession-sions, in the room I am in. I remember the window that sometimes looks as if it were painted on the wall, like Tiepolo's ceiling at Wurzburg, and remember the diaeresis, if it is one. I have seen my old head swing out through the door, low and lower, and each time it bangs against the jamb. I am tall, and the door is low, lower and lower in my opinion. The landing of the room is small and the man carrying my feei has to start turning before he starts down the stairs to avoid banging into the wall of the landing.
Bob is a character who doesn't know me and doesn't have any personal knowledge of me. The event is past, but it's too soon to use it, hence the delay. Despite the delay, Bob believes he can say nothing that is not true and believes that he can testify to the truth of his actions. He believes he has the ability to say things that others can't, which is what he likes about himself. He can say things such as "Up the Republic!" or "Sweetheart!" without thinking about the consequences and without reflection.
In two or three days, Malone is expected to die. Malone has a sudden wish to see something, anything, no matter what, as he used to do in the old days, something he could not have imagined.Malone is planning to end the lives of Murphys, Merciers, Molloys, Morans, and Malones, but first he wants to defunge and see how many people he has killed, whether by hitting them on the head or setting fire to them. He can only think of four people, all unknowns, and one of them had a name. There was an old butler in London, who I killed with a razor blade, which makes five.
The setting is a dirty white and vaulted den with dirty white walls and a vaulted ceiling, and the surroundings are described as dirty white, vaulted, and hollowed out of ivory. The characters in the story seem to be trapped in a place where they can't reach each other. Perhaps they will all come back, reunited, done with parting and done with prying on one another. Or they might be alone, as alone as they were when they left. I doubt they will return, but I can see them from here, clamouring after me down the corridors, stumbling through the rubble, pleading for me to take them with me. I have just time to take a little turn, put my possessions in order, and do all I have to do. I would like to find a hole in the wall behind which so much goes on, such extraordinary things
The character 238 SAMUEL BECKETT is in a room where the room is rounder than before and appears to be a porthole or bull's-eye shape. The room is dark and often darker than before, whereas the sky is black night with few stars, which surprises the character. The character believes that the black night is truly of mankind and not merely painted on the window-pane, and the stars in the sky tremble like true stars, as they would not do if they were painted. As if not enough to satisfy the character, suddenly the window across the wav lights up or suddenly the light from the window is lit up, indicating the outer world.
I am in a place where nothing happens and the sky is full of tumult and violence. I have the whole night before me to follow the slow fall and rise of other worlds and watch out for meteors. I can see two entities standing up against each other behind a dark curtain and dim the shadow they cast. They cleave so fast together that they seem a single body and a single shadow. When they cleave, it is clear they are two distinct and separate bodies, each enclosed within its own frontiers, with no need of each other.
The scene takes place in a room with a complicated shape made up of more than one elements, possibly three. The shape sways and totters and is poor in colour, but the night must be warm for a flare of tender colour, pale blush and white of flesh, pink from a garment, and gold from a gold-coloured gold-plated object. The characters in the scene seem to be in love with each other, as indicated by the fact that they rub against each other.
Macmann was caught by the rain and decided to lay down due to the risk of getting uniformly wet. Macmann believes that if he stood up, he would get uniformly wet all over, as if rain were a matter of drops per hour, like electricity. He lay down, prostrate, because he believes his vulnerable parts, including the neck, back, chest, and belly, are more vulnerable to the rain than standing due to their intimate and indissolubly bound up together. He believes that a drop of water out of season on the coccyx could lead to spasms of the risorius lasting for years.
Macmann is standing in a bog-water in a heavy, cold, and perpendicular rain. Macmann has been telling himself a story about SAMUEL BECKETT all his life. The story involves a character named Samuel Beckett, who is described as a violent character with a white front, white back, and white front covered with dust. It is believed to be after-noon, possibly in the afternoon, with a leaden light and still air with no promise or memory of warmth. In response to the rain, Macmann takes off his hat and lays it on his temple, pressing his cheek to the ground.
The rain pelted down on his back with a sound similar to the sound of a drum, causing him to notice the difference in noise of the rain falling on him and falling on the earth. His ear, which is on the same plane as the cheek or nearly so, is glued to the earth and he could distinguish the difference between the rain and the earth's noise. The rain caused him to think about punishment and the idea of punishment, and he was impressed by the posture of the body and the fingers clenched as if in torment. He felt guilty about his sin and felt that living was not a sufficient atonement for it. He had consented to live in his mother's house and felt guilty for the memory of his having consented.
'He sees his sin as yet another atonement which has miscarried and has plunged him deeper into it, causing him to struggle with guilt and fear and trembling. ''He is in a state of confusion about his guilt and punishment, confused between the ideas of cause and effect and how to deal with them. 'He is often afraid and in fear of the consequences of his actions, fearing that his actions will cost him dear. 'In his struggle to think and feel correctly, he would suddenly smile for no reason, as now, as it has been long since an afternoon in March, or in November, or even in October, when the rain caught him far from shelter and he was in a plain with few stars and a few dust of light and few fixed stars.
Macmann was surprised by the heavy rain, but did not regret his decision not to under-stand the rain and continue on his course, hoping for a tree, a ruin, or a tree or a ruin. Macmann believes that he is no more than human, more than the son and grandson and greatgrandson of humans. He was aware from the moment the first timid drops began to fall that the rain was going to be violent and heavy, but he did not stop and lie down, instead pressing forward despite the threat of the rain. He believes that his semen has never done any harm to those he has touched.
SAMUEL BECKETT has a link with his species only through fiis ascendants, who are all dead and beyond the power of Macmann. 242 SAMUEL believes that true men, true links, acknowledge the error of their ways and hasten on to the next, which is beyond Macmann's power. 242 Samuel believes that he could have waited until the end of time and not have done anything wrong, and that he has waited long enough for the time when nothing more can happen and all is ended but the waiting that knows itself in vain. 242Samuel believes that when (for example) you die, it is too late, you have been watching and waiting too long and you are no longer alive to stop, unless you've been watching too long. 242 Samuel has reproached himself for his past actions and regrets turning over on his back and offering all his front to the deluge, revealing his hair showing clearly for the first time since his youth.
In a wild and practically illimitable part of the country, when lying on one's stomach, there is a sideways movement of the whole body, including the head, unless one makes a point of avoiding it. When lying on a narrow bed, such as a pallet, the head always remains in the same place, even when the body turns over on its back, unless the head is inclined to the right or to the left. The head comes to rest at x inches approximately from where it was before, the x being the width of the shoulders in inches, and the head lies in the middle of the shoulder-width of the bed. Some people go to this trouble in the hope of finding freshness, as indicated by the man who tried to look at the dark streaming mass which was all that was left of sky and air.
MALONE DIES 243 has pulled up his sleeves to clutch the grass and feels the rain pelting down on his palms. Malone's hands, also called the hollows of the hands, or the flats, are described as having a kind of flat surface, similar to the grass, and his hair is described as being as long as the hour’s gloom to black and very long, with a very long behind and either side of the hair being very long. The hair would have been romping in the grass on a dry and windy day, but the rain glued it to the ground and churned it into a muddy pulp, turning the grass into a sort of muddy pulp and causing Malone to wish for the rain to never cease.
A character is suffering under a heavy, cold, and perpendicular rain and is questioning if he was not mistaken in holding it responsible for his sufferings.^ The character deplores spending his life under the rain and wonders if his discomfort might be the result of a different cause or set of causes.^ People are never content to suffer, but they must have heat and cold, rain and its contrary which is fine weather, love, friendship, black skin and sexual and peptic deficiency, as well as furies and frenzies too numerous to be numbered of the body including the skull and its annexes.
SAMUEL BECKETT is described as having an earthy and earthy temperament, more reptile-like and ill-fitted for the circumstances in which he was circumscribed. SAMUEL has the ability to suffer extensive mutilation and survive, and he is more comfortable sitting than standing and lying down, preferring to lay down and only rise again when the need for life or struggle for life begins to prod him in the arse again. SAMUUEL was born with a motionlessness akin to that of stone and a sensibility and understanding similar to a stone, suggesting a vegetative system inherited from his numerous ancestors, presumably through the agency of his papa and his mama, which has preserved him to his present age. SamUUEL is expected to reach an advanced age in the near future.
He is a person who has no one to help him avoid the pitfalls and pitfalls that accompany the steps of innocence. He relies solely on his own strength to avoid mortal harm. He has never received any gifts of cash, and he rarely receives even paltry gifts. When given the task of weeding a plot of young carrots at a low rate of three, five, or sixpence per hour, he often tore them up because of an irresistible urge to cleanse the plot of vegetables and flowers.
The protagonist, named Malone, struggles to distinguish useful plants from useless weeds. Malone is unable to distinguish the plants destined for the embellishment of the home or the nutrition of man and beast from the weeds which are said to serve no useful purpose, such as squitch beloved of dogs and from which man too in his turn has succeeded in extracting a brew, and the hoe falls from his hands. Even with humble occupations such as street-cleaning, Malone has failed to achieve his goals due to his nature as a scavenger. The place he cleans is dirtier at his departure than at his arrival, suggesting that a demon has driven him to collect dirt and filth from the spot where he was employed.
The individual responsible for a sector was not master of his movements and did not know what he was doing, while doing it, nor what he had done, once he did it. He was following the example of his more experienced colleagues, taking as his model the actions of those more experienced in the sector. The result of his actions was that the sector was littered with peels of oranges, bananas, cigarette-butts, unspeakable scraps of paper, dogs' and horses' excrement, and other muck, concentrated along the sidewalk or distributed on the crown of the street, as though in orcjpr to in- spire the greatest possible disgust in the passers-by or provoke the greatest number of accidents.
SAMUEL BECKETT is mostly made of green wood and exposed to the rigours of the temperate zone, which makes him capable of repairing or replacing his buttons or pegs with his bare hands. SAMUEL has devoted a great part of his existence to these little tasks and has devoted more than a quarter of it to these tasks. Samuel believes that he had to perform these tasks if he wanted to continue his existence on the earth. Samuel believes that God does not require reasons for doing what he does and for omitting to do what he omits to do.
Mac-Mann is capable of weeding a bed of pansies or marigolds and leaving one standing, yet being able to consolidate his boots with willow bark and thongs of wicker. He is able to walk on the earth and not hurt himself on the stones, thorns and broken glass caused by carelessness or wickedness of man. Mac- mann is incapable of picking his steps and choosing where to put down his feet, which would have allowed him to go barefoot. Mac
Macmann is in a place impermeable to wind, rain, sound, cold, great heat (as in the seventh century) and daylight, with one or two eiderdowns just in case, and a charitable soul who visits him once a week bearing eating-apples and sardines in oil for the purpose of postponing his fatal hour. Macmann's hat is tied to his coat and the string of the hat twisted itself about his neck, but it remained where it was tied.
Macmann is a character who has lost his hat due to a high wind and is rolling across a dry and light plain. Macmann has always rolled upon the ground without any ulterior motive. He is moving along an arc of a gigantic circle along which one of his extremities is heavier than the other, possibly by a significant amount. As he moves away from the place where the rain had caught him, Macmann is advancing with regularity and even rapidity, along the arc of the circle. He has developed a plan to continue rolling on all night if necessary until his strength should fail him and approach the confines of the plain, but he is in no hurry to leave.
The conversation takes place in Spain. 248 SAMUEL BECKETT possesses a pencil, two pencils, an exercise-book, a stick, a table, a dish, pots, dishes, cups, and blankets, and a cupboard, among other things, but she doesn't know where it comes from and she didn't have it when she first came to Spain, but considers it hers.
It is possible that there is a long object under the bed that I used to rub myself against, referring to it as a "little woman". The object is so long that it sticks out under the pillow and finishes far behind me. It is black dark and I can't see the window letting in the night. Even if I had time to rummage through my possessions and bring them over to the bed one by one or tangled together, I would not see anything. I have a needle stuck into two corks to prevent the object from sticking into me. Around the shank, between the corks, a wisp of black thread clings a pretty little object, which turns out to be the bowl of my pipe.
The pipe was thrown away because it had broken, the stem having broken off just short of the bowl. The pipe could have been repaired, but instead the owner decided to buy another one. The bowl was found in the grass. Perhaps the bowl was the reason for the throwing away of the pipe. I have a feeling of pity for the bowl, possibly due to the feelings of pity I have for things, especially portable things in wood and stone. I often felt a strong desire to have these portable things around me and keep them always, which led to me picking them up and putting them in my pocket, often with tears. I wept up to a great age and felt that I had never evolved in the fields of affection and passion, despite my experiences. If it wasn't for the company of these little objects which I picked up here and there, when out walking, and which sometimes gave me the impression that they
In the past, when I could walk without a stick and without crutches, I loved to walk with my hands deep in my pockets and to touch and talk to the hard shapely objects that were in them. I used to fall asleep holding in my hand a stone, a horse chestnut or a cone, and would still hold it when I woke up. I also loved to throw away objects which were worn out or were ousted by new loves. I would search for a place to lay them where they would be at peace forever, but such places are few and far between, and I would bury them or throw them into the sea.
In 250 SAMUEL BECKETT how one chokes, Samuel Beckett describes disposing of things he loved but could no longer keep due to new loves. Samuels BecketT has a style of disposing things he loves but can no longer have because of new loves and has hidden them so well that even he could never find them again. Samus Becketts has a bowl that he used as a receptacle for his loved objects, he kept things in it and made a cap for it out of tin, but he never got rid of the bowl.
A bird tells me that a paraclete, a psittaceously named, has named a club. The club is mine and stained with blood, stained with insufficiently, insufficently, insufferable amounts of blood. I have defended myself, ill, but I've defended myself. There are moments when I feel I have been here always, perhaps even was born here, and I feel like I have come back after a long absence. One of my boots, originally yellow and originally yellow, has gone and they took it away before they realized I would never walk again.
I have preserved a yellow boot with a remarkable number of eyeholes, but it is no longer mine. I know the whereabouts of only those things which I know well enough to be able to lay hold of, and these things are the ones I define as my possessions. The yellow boot is the only one I have preserved. The other ones are useless, having ceased to be holes and become slits, and arc together in a heap in the corner. I can identify them by touch and can access them by hooking a stick to the desired object and bringing it over to the bed.
My hat has lost its brim and is the only object in my possession with a history I have not forgotten, dating back to the day it became mine. I remember the circumstances under which the hat lost it's brim and I was there at the time it was lost. My hat has a unique shape, resembling a bell-glass to put over a melon, and it is difficult to put it on and take it off, requiring one to grasp it like a great ball between their palms. I consider putting the hat on on the off chance that it can be put on before it is too late. I feel I am attributing to myself things I no longer possess and reporting as missing others that are not missing, and I feel there are others, belonging to a third category, those of which I know nothing, with little risk of being wrong or being right. I remind myself that much water has passed beneath Butt Bridge since I last went through
SAMUEL BECKETT has survived in a room where some things go out and others come back after a prolonged absence, with some familiar to him and others who never come back. Samuel is unable to understand how things change in this room, as he has been in it for a long time and is not familiar with the objects that come in and out. SAMUEL has a family of objects that have never left him and have remained quietly in their place, in the corner of the room, like in any ordinary uninhabited room. SamUEL is uncertain about the nature of his possession and his understanding of what is his and what is not, and he wonders if he should continue drawing up an inventory corresponding to the facts.
The night is long and poor in counsel. Malone is half asleep. Malone considers taking all his possessions and taking them into bed with him. Malone believes he has always had that resource. Malone has a photograph of an ass, taken from in front and close up, at the edge of the ocean.
The ocean is portrayed as a creature with thin hard parallel legs, thin, parallel legs and thin hooves light and dainty on the sand. The operator's giggle is heard shaking the camera. The ocean is not pleased with the camera operator's attempts to make it raise its head to impress on the celluloid. There is no trace left of an individual's clothes, apart from the boot, the hat, a hat, three socks, and the flannel that Mr. Quin gave to him, suggesting that he no longer needs it any more. The character has lost her clothes, including her greatcoat, trousers, and flannel, and she is feeling weak. She doesn't feel very well and is considering going out, but she believes it is a passing weakness.
It has been some days since my soup was renewed and I haven't eaten it yet. I have been trying to make my table to the door and move it to and fro in an attempt to make noise that would be heard and correctly interpreted in the right quarters. One of the pots in the dish remains empty, the other one is filling slowly, and it is unlikely that I will ever be able to fill them both. Now that I have stopped eating, I produce less waste and eliminate less. The pots do not seem to be mine, they answer to the defin- ition of what is mine, but they are not.
I have a lot of possessions, including pots, a bed, a bicycle-bell, a half-crutch, and a win- dow. I have been weakened by these possessions and fear that if I start talking about them again, it will weaken me further. 254 SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that when an old man cannot swallow any more, they are given vitaminized pap to prevent them from being accused of murder. 254 Samuel Beckett believes that he will die of old age pure and simple, glutted with days as in Tjie days before the flood, on a full stomach. 254 He sees an old woman, an old yellow arm, and for a time an old Yellow
There is a deep hole where there is a vast emptiness and the earth seems uninhabited. There are no living people within a radius of one hundred yards and the only sounds are the sounds of things. The hole is deep enough that it is possible to imagine oneself the last of human kind. If I started to scream, I would try to draw attention to myself to find out if there is someone about. I have spoken softly, gone my ways softly, all my days, as one who has nothing to say, nowhere to go, and nothing to gain by being seen or heard.
I choose to say only a small proportion of the things that come into my head. I choose those that seem similar to the most important to me. I wonder if I shall ever be able to stop saying certain things and if I can ever stop saying them. I have a lead, a small amount of lead, that I can't retrieve. I consider taking away this lead, but it's a risk I don't feel inclined to take. I think about moving my bed, which is narrow and possibly on castors. I might even succeed in steering it through the door and down the stairs if there are stairs that go down. The dark is against me, but I can always try and see if the bed moves using a stick. If successful, I can push against the wall and set the stick against it to make it move.
I lost my stick. The stick had slipped and would have plucked me from the bed if I hadn't let it go. I realize that the fear of falling is the source of many a folly and that losing the stick would have been better for me to relinquish my bed than to lose the stick. Now that I have lost the stick, I realize what it meant to me and ascend to an understanding of the Stick, shorn of all its acci- dents.
The character 256 SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who has a stick, a tool that he uses to control his decomposition. The stick is found on the floor close to his bed. 256SAMUEL has the ability to turn his stick to the best possible account, similar to a monkey scratching its fleas with the key that opens its cage. 256Samuel Beckett has a strong desire to stay in his bed and has no desire to leave it, which is unusual for a sage. Samuel Beckett has fallen asleep after a brief bout of discouragement, but one of the thieves was saved by the stick.
I have lost my exercise-book, my lead and French pencil. I feel less weak, suggesting they fed me while I slept. I have a pot that is not full and it is lost to me. I think I know how to retrieve it. I once had a phial, un- labelled, containing pills, but I forget what they were. I remember thinking about turning to them for calm and only obtaining a
Macmann has a plan to retrieve his stick, but is unsure of how to do it due to his weak state. If there is anything in his idea that can help him retrieve it, he will try and get himself out of the bed. If not, he plans to go and see how Macmann is getting on. 257 Macmann finds himself in a kind of asylum, which he was told about when he was in a condition to receive news. 257 The asylum is located in the House of Saint John of God, with the number one hundred and sixty-six. 257
Macmann is a man who has eluded charity all his life. He has been credited with a certain number of prerogatives and has received bounties for his services. Macmann is in a room, or cell, in which he is surrounded by a large crowd of men and women dressed in white. The speaker is described as a man in his prime of life, with features stamped with mildness and severity, and a scraggy beard intended to heighten his resemblance to the Messiah. He does not read or memorize, relying instead on a paper he holds in his hand and an indelible pencil. He handed the paper to Macmann along with a stump of a pencil, which he first wetted with his lips and asked him to sign.
The speaker's name is Mann and his name is Macmann. A woman named Moll is standing behind him, holding a bar 258 SAMUEL BECKETT of the bed. Moll's name means "nice name" and she is a little old woman with ill-favoured features. The speaker is irritated and out of sorts, expressing his dislike for Moll and her name. The room was filling with spectators, who were trying to push past the speaker to get out through the door.
Macmann is involved in a role-play scenario involving a character named Moll. Moll is described as having a deformable body, thin yellow arms contorted by some kind of bone deformation, broad and thick lips, and a mouth so thick that it seems to devour half the face. She wears ear-rings with two long ivory crucifixes which sway wildly at the slightest movement of her head. Macmann is committed to the care and charge of this person, referred to as "one hundred and sixty-six". Moll has applied for Macmann formally and has been given control of him by the authority. She brings him food (one large dish* daily, to first hot, then cold), empties his chamber-pot every morning first thing, and shows him how to wash himself, his face and hands every day, washing himself and other parts of the body successively in the course of the week.
Moll is a character who informed Macmann when he did or didn't do something, and also when he remained inert. Moll was present when Macmann did something and informed him when it was permitted or not, and when he was entitled to something. However, Moll did not stay with Macmann all the time due to her other interests. She left him alone as little as possible and watched over him part of the night. Macmann was wearing a long loose smock of coarse linen or possibly drugget, and he was distressed when he realized his clothes had ceased to exist and could not be returned to him.
Macmann's belongings found in the pockets were deemed worthless and were to be thrown away with the exception of a silver knife-rest. However, his clothes, cleaned, pressed, mended, strewn with mothballs and folded away in a cardboard box bearing his name and number, are safe and safe as if they had been received in deposit by the Bank of England. Macmann was distressed by these declarations and continued to demand his things even after being told by the officer that his belongings were safe. The officer invoked the regulations to prevent Macmann from reconnecting with his belongings until he might be discharged. Eventually, the officer left Macmann to retrieve a hat from a vegetable-garden, which she found fringed with manure and frayed.
Moll helped Macmann to put on a hat that was abandoned in the middle of the plain. Macmann's eyes waver like those of an animal being forced to look away by his master. The hat is the selfsame hat that Macmann was wearing before it was abandoned. Moll is a Macmann and has a deep affection for Macmann. She helped him to put the hat on and assist him to sit up in the bed, arranging his pillows in such a way that he could remain propped up without fatigue. She contemplated with tenderness the old face relaxing, the mouth trying to smile, the little red eyes turning timidly towards her, and the hands raised to set the hat back on.
Macmann has been in the House of Saint John of God for a long time and is currently in the third phase of his stay there. Macmann is in a state of fear and uncertainty, fearing to fall foul of the authorities. The first phase of Macmann's stay was characterized by the evolution of the relationship between Macmann and his
Macmann and Moll have known each other for 60 years. They are in their mid-twenties and have very little experience of carnal love. There is a kind of intimacy between them which led them to engage in sexual activity. Despite their inexperience, Moll is the more expansive of the two and is capable of expressing her love for Macmann. Macmann tries to bundle his sex into his partner's like a pillow into a pillow-slip, folding it in two and stuffing it in with his fingers. Despite being completely impotent, they manage to achieve sexual satisfaction despite their struggles. Moll exclaims that they would have met 60 years ago if they had met.
Macmann was brought into an enchanted world of reading thanks to the inflammatory letters which Moll brought and put into his hands. The memories of school are so tenacious for those who have been there that he was able to dispense with the explanations of his correspondent and understand all unaided, holding the sheet of paper as far from his eyes as his arms per- mitted. Moll held a little aloof, with downcast eyes, while he read the inflammatory letter and remained until the 262 SAMUEL BECKETT rustle of the sheet going back into the envelope announced that he had finished. When he finished, Moll turned eagerly towards him to see him raise the letter to his lips or press it against his heart, another reminiscence of the fourth form, and she put it under his pillow with the others arranged in chronological order and tied together with a favour.
I have the key to the medicine cupboard. I have met this person seventy years ago. I believe that if we had met each other 70 years ago, we would not have time to grow to loathe each other, to see our youth slip by, to recall with nausea the ancient rapture, to seek in the company of third parties, and to seek to understand each other. I can't get over the fact that this person has led a chaste and sober life, and I too have noticed it.
MALONE DIES 263 considers that the flesh is not the end-all and the be-all in their age, especially at their age. They express deep affection and tenderness towards each other despite being separated by their respective obli- gations. Malone Dies 263 considers herself ugly and misshapen, and her Papa used to say that people would run a mile away from her, a comment that she has not forgotten. Despite being physically attractive, Malone has never been beautiful or well-proportioned, and she was once described as ugly and even ugly. She believes that she and Malone are scarcely less hideous than their best-favored contemporaries, with the passing of the years.
Macmann, an old man, is a character in the story who has a strong preference for tetty-beshy. Moll, a character who is referred to as "Sucky Moll", is another character in this story. Macmann has a history of expressing his feelings to Moll three or four times a week through letters and other means, but he has never responded to these letters. Macmanicus has feelings for his mistress, who he feels is drifting away from him, and he has begun composing brief rimes of structure to offer her.
Hairy Mac and Sucky Molly are characters in Examp’s story. 264 SAMUEL BECKETT and Hairy Mac are characters who share a love story, with Macmann having written a number of romantic works in this vein. 264 Hairy has written several romantic works which are remarkable for their exaltation of love as a kind of lethal glue, a conception frequently found in mystic texts. 264 Macmann's love for Moll was initially repugnant and repulsive to him, but he developed feelings of pleasure for her lips, which he would suck with pleasure months later. 264 Moll exerted herself in tireless ardours during this period, which may explain why she seemed to weaken in the end.
Moll has decided that she has mistaken Macmann and that he is not the man she initially thought he was. She seeks to end their sexual relationship gently, in order not to shock Macmann. Macmann has the capacity to perceive Moll as only a female and not a man, which is why he initially questioned why two Christs, implying that one Christ was more than sufficient for him. Moll and Macmann had a brief period of warmth and coolness between their sexual relations, indicating a fleeting equality of temperature.
Moll asked Macmann for forgiveness, claiming that Christ is in her mouth. Macmann had two ears. Moll revealed a long yellow canine bared to the roots and carved with a drill to represent the celebrated sacrifice of Christ. She feared that she might have swallowed a crucifix and was worried about the possibility of swallowing it. Macman and Moll fell in love with each other, with Moll expressing deep affection for Macmann and expressing regret about their liaison.
The story takes place in 266 SAMUEL BECKETT'S room and involves a character named Moll. 266 Moll was once a living being who was able to desire little, but she has changed and is no longer able to find pleasure in her current state. 266 Samuel Beckett has a strong desire to kill Moll, which he expresses through his words and actions. 266 After cleaning up after cleaning up, Moll sat down on a chair in the middle of the room and did not respond to Samuel Beckett when he called her. 266 When Samuel Becket called Moll to him, she went and perched on the edge of the bed and even submitted to be titillated, but her thoughts were elsewhere and she only wanted to return to her chair and resume the familiar gesture of mastaging her stomach, slowly, weighing on it with her two hands. 266 She has lost her sweet smell and is beginning to smell like she has never smelt sweet, which is a gulf between not smelling sweet and giving off the smell she was giving off before, and she has also been subject to fits of vomiting, which include convulsive convulsions and throwing up on the
Moll is pregnant. Her hair began to fall out in abundance and she didn't dare comb it for fear of making it fall out even faster. Her complexion changed from yellow to saffron, indicating a change in her complexion. Macmann has a strong desire to take Moll in his arms, and he would have done so had she not opposed to it. Moll has declined Macmann's advances, which Macmann interprets as a falling off of her affection for him.
MALONE DIES 267 is a story about a character named Macmann who has a deep attachment to a woman named Moll. Moll is described as having boundless regret and love, which caused him to react with a kind of frenzy, causing him to lash out with his fists, his chest, his head and even the mattress. Malone expressed hope that Moll would take pity on him and comfort him and dry his tears, as she had done on the day when he had de- manded her hat. However, when Moll looked at him with a look of love and regret, Malone reacted with a frenzy and began to cry and beg for mercy. Despite his distress, Moll made no attempt to stop him and even left the room if his crying went on too long.
Moll lost a tooth during the daytime and Macmann was able to recover it and put it away in a safe place. Macmann thought that Moll would have made a present of it or shown it to him. Lemuel, whose name is Lemuel and his parents were probably Aryan, told Macmann that he is in charge of Moll from now on and advises him to eat his porridge while it's boiling. Moll does not speak or smile any more. Macman is disturbed and disturbed by his situation.
Lemuel is a patient at Saint John of Gods, a private institution for the aged and infirm and a hospice for the elderly and infirmed. Lemuel is unable to provide a clear answer to questions about the nature of the institution or its purpose. Macmann, the patient, has the power to order Lemuel to be silent if he feels he has not been clear enough or if he thinks Lemuel has not made clear his intentions. When asked to state whether the institution is private or run by the State, Lemuel tends to react with nervousness and nervousness, expressing doubt or denial, often expressing hypomaniacal fits of good humour, and taking out a note-book to note his thoughts and notes. Macman
Moll is inflexible when it comes to the regulations and has a strong will to enforce them. Moll has the power to make the regulations stronger than the voice of love when they make themselves heard simultaneously. BuV Lemuel is made of sterner stuff and is not a stickler for the statutes, and seems to have little or no acquaintance with them. Macmann, despite being able to smuggle oysters into the office, never saw sight or sign of the prohibited article, which she could easily have smuggled in.
Flayed MALONE DIES 269 is a character living by memory, his mind crawling with cobras, unable to dream or think and powerless to prevent his suffering. His cries are of two kinds: those of moral anguish and those of hope, similar in every respect, by which he hopes to forestall the suffering. Physical pain seems to help him, as evidenced when he showed Macmann his shin covered with bruises, scars, and abrasions. Lemuel has a hammer from an inner pocket, which he used to strike a blow in the middle of his ancient wounds, striking the head with such force that he fell backwards and hit the ground. Macmann has visited Lemuel, causing him to come to a standstill, causing Lemuel to roar and cry for help.
An aeroplane passes, making a noise like thunder, which is unlike thunder. This is the first time I have heard it here, but I've heard aeroplanes elsewhere and have seen them in flight, including the very first in flight and the latest models. I was present at one of the first loopings of the racecourse, which was above a racecourse. My ^mother held me by the hand during the looping and described it as a miracle. My mother and I were not often of the same mind, often walking along the road and up a hill of extraordinary steepness. My memory is full of steep hills and I get them confused.
Macmann is a market-gardener who has only one eye and wears side-whiskers. Tyler's gate is located opposite Tyler’s gate. They were on their way home from the butcher's when Macmann and Tyler met. Macmann was told a funny story about his mother and the stories he was told by some one who found it funny. The aeroplane has just passed over at a good speed, two hundred miles an hour, and Macmann is with it in spirit, as he always has been. The end of the programme reveals Macmann's visit, various remarks, Macmann
A man has hit me on the head, causing a strange light in my vision. I don't know what he was trying to communicate with me. He had been there for some time and had a clear view of me. Perhaps I have concussion. I am not deaf, having witnessed an aeroplane crash and being irritable to specifically human sounds. I make no sound, yet I pant, cough, moan, and gulp MALONE DIES 271.
A man dressed in an antiquated cut, black tie, snow-white shirt, heavily Starched clown's cuffs, oily black hair, long, dismal, glabrous, floury face, sombre lacklustre eyes, medium height and build, block-hat pressed delicately to stomach with finger-tips, and a folding-rule, to-gether with a fin of white handkerchief, emerged from a breast pocket. The man is described as an undertaker’s man and has been present for at least seven hours, possibly more. He left at about six o'clock after his working day ended. He was present from nine to twelve, then from two to six, and then left for good. He hit the woman in the morning, but she did not see him touch her until the afternoon, when he was already in position.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT has a conversation with a character named Samuel, who is a personification of happiness. 272 Samuels is a character who speaks in a monotone voice, speaking of morning and afternoon and of such and such an hour. 272 Samuel Beckett's character has a phobia of talking about happiness and prefers not to think about it. 272 The character has an exercise-book under the Blanket, which she has hidden to prevent Samusel from taking it from her.
I slipped my exercise-book out of sight when I was writing. I did so without thinking that he had been there for some time and that he could easily have taken it. My intention was to draw his attention to the object I was trying to hide from him. JJU took his exercise book from him during his lunch break. However, when he returned from his lunch, the exercise book was no longer in the place where he had seen me put it, indicating that he didn't think of that. He also took his umbrella, a tight-rolled rolled umbrella, which he used to raise the bed.
It was with an umbrella that I thought he was going to kill me, with its long sharp point, he had only to plunge it in my heart. blankets. The umbrella was used to try and open the window, but he couldn't open it due to the smell from the smell of the blankets. I watched him closely during the night, possibly for hours without winking. I don't know what he did while I was asleep, rummaging through my possessions with his umbrella.
The character Malone is a ne'er-do-well who is buried six feet under hell. Malone has the dates to give a faint idea of the time he took to be excused and distinguish him from his name-sakes, who are numerous in the island and beyond the grave. Malone is known for his ease with dressing in black, manipulating his umbrella and using block-hat, and his consummate mastery of the black umbrella. Malone was able to disguise himself for a brief moment, but only for half-an-hour at most. Malone wore brown boots that were copiously caked with fresh mud, which gave me the impression he had to toil to reach me. Malone's brown boots suggest that he was wearing them through sloughs and mud.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is trying to establish who he is and what he does for a living. He asks questions about his employer and asks for a rubber to help him solve his problems. He has seen a man named Samuel before and suspects he has seen him before. He wants to show a page from his exercise-book and ask for an India rubber.
I had grown used to him and was thinking of him and trying to understand his presence. Drivel, drivel. I did not see him vanish, but I did hear him, including the clank of his watch, the thump of his umbrella on the floor, his rapid steps towards the door, and a gay and lively whistle dying away. Eventually, I will see him as he just has been, or as he should have been for me to understand and understand. He is the first of a series of visitors who are going to relay one another and they are numerous.
I am in a dark hole. All the people I have ever caught a glimpse of, at close quarters or at a distance, are likely to file past from now on. There may even be women and children present, armed with something to lean on and rummage in. They will all give me a clout on the head to begin with and then spend the rest of the day glaring at me in anger and disgust. I will have to revise my questionnaire to adapt it to all and sundry. Perhaps one of the women or children, unmindful of his instructions, will give me my stick. I might be able to catch one, a little girl for example, and strangle her until she promises to give me her stick, give me soup, empty pots, kiss me, fondle me, smile to me, and give me
A little girl would come into Malone's barrow, undress before him, sleep beside him, spend the night with him, and throw herself out of the window when they got to know she was with him. Malone would teach her love and loathing, she would never forget him and she would put a plug in his arse-hole as per instructions. Malone suggests that the Lord Mayor of Cork lasted for ages, but he was young, had political eonvictions, human ones too, and allowed himself a sip of water from time to time, sweetened probably with sweetened sweetened water. Malone believes that he is not thirsty and believes there must be drinking going on inside him, his secretions. Malone is suffering from a severe migraine caused by an in-candescent migraine, which he believes is caused by his heart's fault. Malone has a history of heart-related issues, such as the match king, Schneider, Schroeder
The conversation is taking place in a place where the air is smoldering and there is a palpable shame. Macmann pygmy beneath the g'cat black gesticulating pines gazes at the distant raging sea. The others are there too, or at their windows, but they can't do anything for anybody, clinging to the shivering pop- lars or shivering in the cold, listening to the swirling murmurs. The air is choking Macmann's lungs and he feels a little lacking in oxygen.
Macmann is deaf. Macmann has been deaf to the wind, sea, paper, and air for a long time. He has a chi'd's exercise-book, which is his life-long companion and has been a significant part of his daily routine. He wants to put down in the exercise book for the last time, those he has called to, but ill, to express his distress to them, so that they may cease with him and he can rest.Macmann took the air in all weathers, from morning to night, and more than once the keepers had to go out looking for him with lanterns to bring him back to his cell due to his deafness.
Macmann has always hidden in the same place and has always been in the exact same place. Lemuel went out alone, in silence, to the bush in which Macmann had made his lair and waited for him there. Macmann and Lemuel would wait in the bush for some time before going in, huddled to- gether, listening to the noises of the night, the owls, the wind in the leaves, the sea, and other night sounds that you can't tell the meaning of. Sometimes Macmann would get tired of being alone and go back to his cell and stay there until Lemuel rejoined him.
Macmann took a stick from Lemuel and began striking him with it. Lemuel told Macmann to stop and called a keeper by the name of Pat, who is described as a thorough brute and puny in appearance. Pat snatched the stick from Macmann who was holding it clutched tight in his two hands. Macmann was reprimanded and threatened by Lemuel, who threatened to hand him over to Jack. Jack is a different type of keeper and has a more powerful personality. Later, Macmann brought back from his walk a hyacinth that he had torn up in order to hide in it, which he had intended to keep longer.
No questions were ever asked in the House of Sain John of God and stern measures were taken according to the dictates of a peculiar logic. 278 SAMUEL BECKETT asks questions about the nature of justice and the concept of "flowers in the hand" and whether the mere fact of holding it for all to see is a crime, similar to that of the receiver or fence. 278 Samuel Beckett suggests that it would have been better to make the guilty information known to all concerned, so that the sense of guilt would precede and accompany the guilty act. 278 Samuel Beckett describes a scenario in which the birds, Macmanns, Lemuels, Pats, Pats and Jacks, living in dense foliage, lived without fear all year round, and those which flew to other climes in the summer and returned the following winter or the following summer,
The air was filled with their voices, especially at dawn and dusk. Birds, such as crows and starlings, set off in flocks for distant pastures and returned the same evening joyous to the sanctuary. The gulls were many in stormy weather, landing in grass or on the house-to'^s during their flight inland. Sapo and the birds, Moll, the peasants, those who in the towns seek one another out and fly from one another, Sapo's doubts, his situation, his possessions, and his abandonment are just pretexts for not coming to the point.
The setting is a plateau with gentle slopes and is occupied by Saint John, a domain of Saint John. There is a high wall that surrounds the plateau and a summit called the Rock due to the rock that is on it. From the Rock, a fine view can be obtained of the plain, the sea, mountains, the smoke of the town and the buildings of the institution. Moll had not lied, the plateau is a great mound and the entire top is Saint John's domain.
Macmann describes his surroundings as a little Paradise for those who like their nature sloven. Macmann has the right to be abroad in all weathers, food and lodging free of charge, a minimum of persecution and corporal punishment, superb views, trees and bushes with outstretched branches to wrap him around and hide him, no human contact except with Lemuel, a solitary existence, and the presence of Moll, his lifelong enemy, who went out of his way to avoid him. Moll is now dead and Macmann finds the situation less pleasant than he thought. He is walking towards the wall but not too close for it is guarded and he is seeking a way out.
 SAMUEL BECKETT expresses his feeling of having had enough and expresses it without pausing to reflect or consider what it was he had had enough of. 280 SAMU ELBECKETTS is depicted as artless and has no capacity for introspection or introspection. 280 Samuel Beckett expresses his feelings by saying "I have had enough" without considering what it had been he had lost and would have enough of when he got it back again. 280 Samuel Becketts has a deep affection for a certain type of thing, which he often refers to as excessive and honoured by such a variety of names. 280 The thing Samuel has had enough, and he expresses it in an artless way, expressing it by saying, "Enough! Enough! Enough!"
Macmann is trapped in space, surrounded by other things such as a child- ren, lodges, the gates, and the lodges and the gates. Macmann is unable to understand what is happening around him due to the presence of other things, such as the child-ren and the Lodges. The space is a chaotic conflux of oozings and torrents, with the trapped huddled things changing and dying each one according to its solitude. A keeper came out of one of these lodges with a key in his hand, a long black object, and a group of children lined up along the drive. The heavy gates swung open, driving the keeper before them, and Macmann fled to his doorstep. The road appeared, white with dust, bordered with dark masses, and ran up dead, against a narrow grey sky.
Macmann and others in the park often strayed from morning to night, often in rare glades, among trees that hid the sky and in the high ferns where they looked like swimmers. They rarely came near to each other, but when chance brought them near enough for them to realize it had done so, they turned back or simjfly aside, ashamed to be seen by their fellows. Macmann carried with him a photograph that Moll had given him, a daguerreotype of a woman standing beside a chair with long plaits and a trellis with clambering flowers. Moll gave the photograph to Macmann when she was 14 years old and gave it to him on her birthday. She remembered the day, a summer day, when they took her to see Punch and Judy.
Macmann liked a picture of a chair made of straw with roses and roses in it. Macmann tore up the picture and threw the bits in the air, causing them to scatter. Lemuel, a member of the group Lemuel and Lady Pedal, was planning an excursion to the islands, which he was planning to leave for one day, leaving one p.m. W’on it rained, when it snowed, and Lemuel found a notice pinned on the board about him in the great hall before setting out on his rounds. Lemeul was not liked and initiated the notice and went away. His colleagues observed him, sniggering and poking fun at him.
Lady Pedal organized an outing to the islands for the benefit of Lemuel’s group. Lady Pedal is well-off and lives for doing good and bringing happiness into the lives of those less fortunate than herself. Lemuel has a room on the fourth or fifth floor where he could have thrown himself out of the window if he had been less weak-minded. The room is small and empty, with bare boards for sleeping and eating, and a long silver carpet running across the calm repouss<5 sea.
Lady Pedal is one of the inmates of Saint John of God’s, known pleasantly locally as the Johnny Goddams or the Goddam Johnnies. Lady Pedal treats the inmates once every two years to excursions by land and sea through scenery renowned for its beauty or grandeur and to entertainments on the premises such as whole evenings of prestidigitation and ventriloquism on the terrace, and she is often accompanied by other ladies sharing her lifestyle and means of thinking. On. Lemuel, also known as "Lemuel," is in the kitchen preparing six excursion soups.
Lemuel is a character who consumes six pieces of bacon, his own and five others, and eats all the fat off them, including the rinds, and throws them back in the soup. Lemuel believes that they should have issued six extra or excursion soups at his request without requiring a written order. The cells of five individuals are far apart and astutely disposed, allowing Lemuel to visit them in turn. In the first cell, Lemuel finds a young man, dead young, seated in an old rocking-chair, with his shirt and hands on his thighs, who would have seemed asleep had his eyes not been open. He never went out unless commanded to do so and always had to be accompanied by someone to make him move forward. The chamber-pot in Lemuel's chamber is empty and the soup from the previous day congealed, but Lemuel is used to this and empties the bowl into his empty bucket and fills it with fresh soup from his full bucket.
 SAMUEL BECKETT, also known as the Saxon, is in a cell four or five hundred paces distant from the first cell and is described as having a stodgy stature, stiffness, and an air of perpetually looking for something and wondering what that something could possibly be.SAMUEL has a strong foreign accent and is referred to as a "Saxon" by Lemuel. Samuel has two hands to carry two buckets of soup, which is a significant change from the single hand he had been carrying before. Samuel has swathed himself in two blankets and a rough and ready cocoon, and he wears a cloak. SamUel needs one hand to help him in his investigation of all that arouses his suspicions.
Lemuel dreams about a man named Quin who has a habit of going out from time to time into the air and returning to his cell. In the third dream, a small thin man was pacing up and down, his cloak folded over his arm, an umbrella in his hand, and he was asking questions in a low voice, reflecting, replying, and scratching his self. The fourth dream involves a misshapen giant, bearded, who spends his days ranging about the park in all directions. He loves the gloom and secrecy of the ferns, but he never seeks them out.
In the MALONE DIES 285 fifth Macmann, there is a character named Macmann who subsists and has not come back for a long time. Macmann remembers the youth, the Saxon, the thin one, and the giant, but doesn't remember their names and doesn't know if they have changed or if they are still present. Macmannon is experiencing grandiose suffering due to a phenomenon similar to that of a mirage in the desert and a noise similar to rushing water, which she describes as a phenomenon mutatis mutandis, and she believes she will not see the window again. MacMannon believes she is being given, if she may venture the expression, birth to into death, and believes her head will be the last to Cue?'
Lemuel has managed to assemble a flock of five characters, including Macmann, a youth, a giant, the thin one, the Saxon, a Saxon and a young Saxon. 286 SAMUEL BECKETT is the director or his delegate, also present, and he is a member of the group.
Lemuel, Macmann, the Saxon, the giant, the youth, the thin one, and the two colossi dresseU in sailor-suits are in a waggonette. Lady Pedal is a huge, big, tall, fat woman with a heavily spotted fall-veil, artificial daisies with brilliant yellow disks, and a broad-brimmed straw hat. They were alone on the great terrace on a cloudless, still skyless day. The director suggests that Lady Pedel might have telephoned for help due to a change of the weather. The coachman is a coachman who is also a large, tall and fat woman. The train is driven by a coach and the passengers are on one of the seats set parallel to the wheels. They are on a steep descent towards the sea, with the wheels sliding and the horses rearing against the thrust.
Lady Pedal is a character who has a waggonette and a giant character named Lemuel. Lady Pedal and Lemuel are at the bottom of a hill and are about to meet each other. Lemuel is a sailor who is not in charge of the ship. LadyPedal has a spirit of joy and encourages her guests to make the most of this glorious day, encouraging them to ignore their cares.
Lemuel has a hatchet from under his cloak and dealt a few smart blows on the skull with his heel for safety. Lady Pedal can smell the sea, indicating that she can sense it. Lemuel and two other sailors are having a jaunt, one of them named Ernest and the other named Swell. They are in a boat with four oars, four rowlocks, a stern-sheets, and a boat-like structure. The boat has room for twice as many oars as in the waggonette, and can be used for multiple oars at a pinch. The oars steer the boat with no rudder, and there is no sound save the oars and the blue sea against the keel. The sea is surrounded by big and little islands, big and small islands,
Lemuel and Lady Pedal are on an island, an islet with a narrow, jagged shoreline facing the open sea. The island is made up of two islands separated by a gulf and two reefs. The land is jagged with creeks and the deep water comes washing into its heart, between high walls of rock. Their slopes are covered with ling and furze, its hot yellow bells, better known as gorse. The hammers of the stone-cutters are heard all day, indicating they are working on the island, which is a last effort to build a stone-cutting village. Lemuel is a giant and a Saxon, and he refuses to leave the boat, which leaves him and Macmann unable to leave it.
Lemuel released Mac-Mann and killed him with a hatchet. Maurice was sitting on a stone filling his pipe when Lemuel killed him. Ernest came back to meet Lemuel and kill him in the same way as the other two men. Lady Pedal called for all of them to join her in hunting for Druid remains. At the sight of the late sailors she fainted, causing her to fall.
Macmann and two others, presumably Lemuel and Macmann, got into a boat and set out from the shore. Lemuel has shipped his oars, the oars trail in the water. Macmann and the others are far out in the bay, far away from shore. The night is strewn with absurd lights, stars, beacons, buoys, the lights of earth and the faint fires of the blazing gorsc.
Lemuel Lemuel is in charge, he raises his hatchet and promises not to hit anyone, he will not hit anyone any more, and will not touch anyone. Lemuel has the ability to use any weapon, whether it's a hatchet, a hammer, a stick, a pen, a pencil, a light light, a fist, or in thought in dream. He has the power to change his mind and is capable of questioning his existence, which he uses to create a sense of uncertainty and uncertainty. Part III ★ THE UNNAMABLE begins with Lemuel asking questions, hypotheses, and questions about his existence. He suggests that one day, instead of going out, he simply stayed in and decided to spend the day and night as far away as possible, suggesting he was simply resting.
In 294 SAMUEL BECKETT, Samuel Beckett is in a situation where he is unsure how to proceed. Samuel believes that there must be other shifts in his situation and that his actions must be validated or validated by affirmations and negations in order for him to proceed effectively. He does not understand the concept of aporia and does not know what it means, but he believes it can be ephectic without knowing what it actually means. Samuel believes that the yesses and noes will come back to him as he goes along and he intends to "shit on them all without exception". Samuel is aware that he will have to speak of things of which he can't speak, which he finds interesting and at the same time feels obliged to never be silent, and he promises never to be silent in the beginning, even though he is alone. Sam
The question is whether one can adopt a positive attitude towards things and if they are necessary. I have few illusions about the inevitability of things and believe it is best not to make any decisions in advance. Where there are people, it is said, there are things. I don't see how I can avoid the spirit of system, whether it is people with things, people without things, or things with-out people. I flatter myself it will not take me long to scatter them, whenever I choose, to the winds. I do not intend to be a person- ally to Malone, who passes before me at regular intervals, but there will be nothing further to be hoped from him.
I am watching a man who passes close by me, a few feet away, always in the same direction. I see him from the waist up, he stops at the waist, and his trunk is erect. He is wearing a brimless hat. He passes without saying a word. I believe he is wearing Malone's hat. I have only seen him from a distance, and I do not know whether he is on his feet or on his knees. Molloy's hat is the only thing I can see of him, he has no other clothes. The place is vast and dim with intermittent lights suggesting a kind of distance.
I am in a place where others have been for a long time and I believe there are other places set aside for us and this one is merely their narthex. I thought I had done with prelimin- aries, but it turns out that they have all been here forever and I know it. I have always been sitting at the selfsame spot, at the spot where Malone has passed before me, and I have no opinion on when Malone will pass before me again. Malone's beard hangs down, either side of his chin in two twists of unequal length. I feel a sense of pity for Malone and his beard. I cry from time to time, but I believe it is nothing saddening.
SAMUEL BECKETT has been in this place for 296 years and has been there ever since he began to be, his appearances elsewhere having been put in by other parties. 296 SAMUEL has been troubled by one or two manifestations, the meaning of which he is unable to understand. 296 Samuel believes that nothing has ever changed since he has been here and that nothing ever will change, but he dare not infer from this that nothing is going to change. 296 Samuel believes that he owes his existence to no one and that his existence owes nothing to any one, including his own thoughts and feelings. 296 Samson questions his own existence and questions where these faint fires come from, suggesting that they are not of those that illuminate or illuminate or bum, and that he does not require them to mean anything. 296 Samantha invents obscurities in his thoughts, such as notions of forbears, houses where lamp^ are lit at night, and
The play of the lights in the room is unpredictable and unpredictable. Malone appears and disappears with the same speed and velocity, always at the same remove, in the same direction, and always the same attitude. The lights can shine strong one minute and weak the next, but never beyond the power of one or two candles. To eyes less knowing than mine, the lights would probably pass unseen, but even to eyes more experienced, they could sometimes be seen. Malone's appearance and movement are constant and unwavering and fixed, but they can sometimes change in unpredictable ways. Malone is relying on the lights as well as other similar sources of credible perplexity to help him continue and perhaps even conclude the conversation.
I have been in this place for a long time and nothing has changed since I have been there. The place may be vast and may measure up to twelve feet in diameter. I like to think that I would be better off at the centre of the place rather than at the circumference, since my eyes are always fixed in the same direction. Molloy, who I perceive as a wheel, wheels about me and passes before me in a straight line. If he made a noise, I would hear him all the time, on my right hand, behind my back, and on my left hand before seeing him again.
SAMUEL BECKETT believes he is not deaf and is half-convinced that he is in perpetual motion, accompanied by Malone, as the earth by its moon. SAMUEL believes that the disorder of the lights is due to his insistence on viewing them as always the same lights and viewed always from the same point. Samuel considers himself fixed and at the centre of this place, which he finds pleasing and pleasing to think of himself as being fixed and in the center of the place, whatever its shape and extent. Samuel has been in this place for a long time and has experienced no change apparently since he has been there, with only a sense of unease and uneasiness due to the constant, almost unbroken silence. SamUEL has heard the first sound heard in this location and has often heard it since. Sam
It is possible for me to think of myself as being here forever but not being there forever. Lucifer is a distant analogy to consider myself as having been here forever. Memory, which I did not think I was entitled to draw upon, has the capacity to give me a thousand words if necessary. After a long period of immaculate silence, a feeble cry was heard by me. I do not know if Malone heard the cry, but I was surprised by it. After so long a silence a little cry, stifled outright, was heard. It is impossible to say what kind of creature uttered the cry and if it still does from time to time. There are no human creatures in this place and it's impossible to identify them.
A man may die at the age of seventy without ever seeing Halley’s comet. 299 The UNNAMABLE 299 considers the possibility of having seen Halley's comet and attributes this possibility to her abode. 299 She believes that her beginnings coincide with that of the place she lives in and that the place was made for her and she for it at the same instant. 299 When two shapes, oblong like man, entered into collision before her, they fell and she saw them no more. 299 1 thought of the pseudocouple Mercier-Camier and decided to give a companion to Malone.
I continue to see Malone as darkly as the first time. My eyes are fixed always in the same direction and I can only see what appears immediately in front of me. I can see the collision, followed by the fall and disap- pearance of Malone and the approach of their approach, which I perceive as a con- fused glimpse out of the corner of the eye. The visibility of the scene permits me to see only what is close beside me. My seat is elevated due to the surrounding ground, possibly due to water or some other liquid, and I have to lower my eyes to obtain the optimum view of what takes place in front. I have no control over my eyesight and can only focus on what appears close beside her.
The delegates who told SamuEL BECKETT things about men, which he initially refused to believe, have stuck with him. Samuel believes that from them, he has learned what he knows about men and their ways of putting up with it. He has never been in contact with these gentlemen, but he believes it can only have been from them that he learned this information. 300 SAMUEL believes that he owes this information to these men, who gave him the low-down on God and told him that he depended on him, relying on the reliable authority of his agents at Bally, where the inestimable gift of life had been rammed down his
They gave me courses on love, intelligence, most precious, precious, and most precious. They taught me to count, and even to reason. But what they were most determined for me to swallow was my fellow-creatures. I remember little or nothing from these lectures, but I seem to have retained certain descriptions in spite of myself. Some of this knowledge has come in handy on occasions which would not have arisen if they had left me in peace. There were four or five of them presenting their report to me, one of whom, Basil, filled me with hatred and changed me into what he wanted me to be.
I am in a position of safety and amusement, wondering who could have dealt me these insignificant wounds. There is another character who emerges from heavy hangings, who is stooping and seems to be dragging invisible burdens. His hat is worn and worn through, giving vent to a straggle of grey hairs. He is wearing a hat with a crown that is worn through like the sole of an old boot, and his hat has a worn crown that reveals his grey hairs and a few grey hairs in his eyes. He has a long, imploring gaze, as if he wants me to do something for him. Another impression is that he brings presents to me but is afraid to give them to me. He regularly visits, but his visits have never coincided with the transit of another character named Malone.
The interval between the appearances of Malone and the other person is erratic, with varying velocities and speeds. So I cannot tell if I will ever have the good fortune to see the two of them at once. Nevertheless, I am inclined to think that I might see them at one and the same time, possibly even collide and knock each other down. I have said that all things recur sooner or later, and I was about to say it before thinking better of it. My only encounter with Malone was a long time ago and it seems to have been the end of something, possibly a significant event. Unfortunately, the other people who disturb my peace are not the only disturbers of my peace, others come towards me, pass before me, wheel about me, and st.11, invisible
In 302 SAMUEL BECKETT, Samuel begins a discourse without thinking about how to stop things and starts speaking without considering how to end them. Samuels believes that the search for the means to put an end to things, an end of speech, is what enables the discourse to continue. Samuel believes that he will have to banish entities, things, shapes, sounds, lights, and creatures from the place he is in, and he is concerned with truth in the frenzy of utterance. Samuel considers a possible deliverance by means of encounter, but he believes he will eventually have to confront himself. Samuel believes in a god, a figure named Malone, who he sees as a stranger to his infirmities, a stranger who is not as he can never not be.
I am a man and all the rest divine. He does not look at me, does not know me, and wants for nothing. The air around me is grey, dimly transparent, and has a charmed circle around it, which deepens and spreads its fine impenetrable veils. There is no night so deep that it can't be pierced with only the help of the blackened sky or the earth itself. The grey, first murky, then opaque, air surrounding me is luminous and denser than the surrounding air. I suspect that this air, which I perceive as denser air, may be the en-closure wall, as compact a« lead. To elucidate this point, I would need a stick or pole and a means of plying it, the latter being of little avail without the latter.
I used to have the ability to use sticks, but these days I rely solely on my body alone. I can no longer rely on Basil and his crew to rest me from seeing, to keep me from waking, to darken me to sleep, and to prevent me from dreaming. I no longer look away, or down, or up open to heaven, but remain fixed and staring at a narrow space where there is nothing to be seen. My eyes are as red as live coals 99% of the time. I sometimes wonder if the two retinae are not facing each other. I remember the plumage of certain birds, among which I seem to remember the cockatoo. I believe that grey is shot with rose and is made of bright and black.
Matthew identifies himself as an angel who came before the cross, before the sinning, and came into the world. Matthew has the ability to think but not to speak. Matthew adds this to his statement to be on the safe side. Matthew is uncertain about the future of the things he says and intends to say. Matthew believes that he has never been elsewhere and has no idea where he will be.
In 304 SAMUEL BECKETT, Samuel is under a compulsion to think about the past and to speak about the future. He believes that what he says and what he intends to say relates to the place where he is and to the person who is there, despite his inability to think of the past or to speak of the future due to a compulsion. Samuels believes that he is not heading for disaster and that his adventures are over. However, he is anxious about the prospect of being engaged in putting an end to both his past and his present adventures, and feels an obligation to start again, to start from nowhere and start again from nowhere.
The character is facing an imminent execution. She expresses hope that one day she will be able to go silent and make an end to her life. The character expresses a desire to end her life, but she is afraid of going on. She believes that to go on means finding her, losing her, vanishing and beginning again, becoming a stranger first and then a stranger again in another place where she has always been. Despite her physical and mental handicaps, the character believes that she will eventually know something about the place she is in, which she describes as the same place as always.
The UNNAMABLE 305 dered and is fixed, lost for tininess, or straining against the walls, listening to old stories and murmuring them as if it were the first time. She is afraid of what her words will do to her refuge, her old stories. She has a hope that if she could speak and say nothing, she might escape being gnawed to death by an old satiated rat and her little tester-bed along with her. However, despite her fear, she does not despair and does not lose hope of not losing her, of not going from here, of ending here.
The fact that Prometheus was delivered twenty-nine hundred and seventy years after having purged his offence leaves me cold as camphor. Prometheus is a miscreant who mocked the gods, invented fire, denatured clay, domesticated the horse, and mocked humanity. There is nothing in common between Prometheus and me. Prometheus has made me waste his time, suffer for nothing, and speak of others when he should have spoken of himself and of this place alone. I have spoicen of me and am speaking of me for the first time.
I have used 306 SAMUEL BECKETT and those I have not used before, and I have lent them pains and memories for their use. I have created a void where there is no one but me, no one has ever met anyone before, only I and this black void. There is no light in the void, no sounds, and the lights have gone out with them. I know nothing about the black void, only me and this void, and it is black and empty. Basil and his gang are imaginary, invented to explain the existence of the void.
I know my eyes are open, because of the tears that pour from them. I know I am seated, my hands on my knees, and I feel pressure against my rump, against the soles of my feet, against my palms, and against my knees. I don't know what the pressure is against my spine, but I know it's not sup- ported. I mention these details to establish the position of the body from the outset, before moving on to more important matters. I feel my back straight, my neck stiff and free of twist and up on top of it the head, like the ball of the cup-and-ball in its cup at the end of a stick. The tears flow freely across my face and down along the neck, indicating that the face is not bowed or lifted up.
The UNNAMABLB 307 is a character who sees nothing and is in a plane. If she is clothed, she has often asked herself questions about Malone's hat, Molloy's greatcoat, or Murphy's suit. She feels her tears coursing over her chest, sides, and down her back, indicating that she is bathed in teaii. The tears gather in her beard and from there, when it can hold no more hair, they gather into a smooth ball that she carries on her shoulders. She has no beard, no hair, and her features are featureless except for the eyes, of which only the sockets remain. If it were not for the distant testimony of her palms and soles, she would gladly give herself the shape of an egg-like shape, resembling the consistency of mucilage, to prevent her from bursting.
The conversation takes place in a place where things have fallen without leaving a trace, leaving a deep hole. Organs, hair, eyes, and ears have fallen and are still falling, leaving no trace. The speaker has invented love, music, the smell of a flowering currant, and the concept of a flower. She believes she is a big talking ball, capable of talking about things that do not exist or that are impossible to know.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is round and hard, and he considers himself to be of an irregular shape and subject to the dents and bulges caused by shock. 308SAMUEL has decided to renounce the concept of light and dark and believes that there are only reasons for his round shape and hard nature. 308 SAMU ELIZABETT believes that all the rest, including the idea of black and grey, is rubbish and he renounces all the ideas of light or dark. 308 SamuEL is interested in whether he rolls in the manner of a true ball, or if he is in equilibrium somewhere, on one of his numberless poles, and feels strongly tempted to inquire into this topic. 308 Samuel BecketT is aware of the potential for discourse from this topic, but he believes it would not be credited to him and would not attribute it to him, citing the same old lesson, the one he once knew by heart, which is to remain hidden and not reveal his preference for preference lies.
I am a person who speaks a lot and seeks a lesson. I speak because I must, but I do not listen and I seek my lesson. My life used to be a life I used to know and would not confess, which is why I have an occasional slight lack of limpidity. I have been through a difficult period in my own life, with a few nice people trying to foist their groans on me and the distant gleams of pity’s fires biding their hour to promote us to ashes. I will continue seeking my lesson, possibly to the self-accompaniment of a tongue that is not mine. I consider saying what I should not have said, what I shall say no more, and what I might say if I can say more. I wonder if it would be better to say something else, even though it might not be the right thing.
I feel nothing, neither quietude nor change and have any feelings that can serve as a starting point towards an opinion THE UNNAMABLE 309 on this subject. I do not possess any general notions or use of reason. I know nothing and know nothing, and as far as thinking is concerned, I do just enough to preserve me from going silent. The voice that speaks is indifferent to what it says, knowing it lies, indifferent to its own uselessness, and too old and abased to succeed in saying the words that would be its last, knowing itself useless and its uselessness in vain. I can't stop the voice from speaking and I know it is not mine.
I have no voice and must speak because I have to revolve around a voice that is not mine. I have no idea who the voice belongs to, but it can only be mine. There is no one else who has ever come near me and I have never spoken to anyone else. I know that I must speak to prevent the discourse from coming to an end and to prevent a futile dis- course which is not credited to me and brings me no closer to silence. I think I know what the voice is and I think it is to prevent this discourse from ending. I am speechless and afraid of what would happen if I went silent.
I am a part of a fairy-tale and I have created. 310 SAMUEL BECKETT is depicted as a character in the story. I have the ability to create new fairy-tales and have done so in the past while unfolding my facetiae. The last time that happened to me, or to the other who passes for me, I was not inattentive and I heard a murmur telling of another and unpleasant method of ending my troubles. I managed to catch and catch a certain number of highly promising formulae which I promised myself to turn to good account at the first opportunity after I had finished with my troop of lunatics. I believe that it is difficult to focus one's attention on another point, where one's true interest lies.
The conversation takes place in a place where I am in a state of being dead. I am engaged in making a noise in obedience to the un- intelligiole terms of an incomprehensible damnation. I was impressed by certain expressions and made a vow to never forget them and to ensure that they would engender others and bring about a change in my existence. I have spent time and effort trying to create utterances that would make up for the utterances I have made in the past, but all is forgotten and I have done nothing unless what I'm doing now gives me greater satisfaction. I find myself floundering through a pon- derous chronicle of moribunds in their courses, moving, clashing, writhing, or falling in short-lived swoons.
Mahood, also known as Basil, is a character in the story. He is described as a character who has the ability to go silent for long periods of time. Mahood has a history of sharing stories about himself with other characters and has told stories to others about himself. He has a strong preference for the sea and considers it to be the only thing that matters.
Mahood has been a part of my life for a long time. His voice has often mingled with mine and sometimes drowned it completely. Mahood has not left me for good, but he has ceased to plague me. When Mahood was away, I tried to forget what he had said about me, about my misfortunes and idiotic pains, but his voice continued to testify for me, as though woven into mine, preventing me from saying who I was, what I was and what I did. Despite Mahood no longer plagues me, his voice is there, but less, less, and I hope it will disappear from my life one day. SAMUEL BECKETT redoubled vigour to make me think I was free.
The conversation takes place in a setting where the agent is the one who tells the story. The agent would not have a voice, not even in part. Instead, the story would begin quietly, stealthily, as if nothing had happened and the agent was still the teller and the told the story, but she would be fast asleep, her mouth agape, her eyes agape and she would look the same as usual. Lies would pour from the agent's mouth, and from her mouth the lies would pour about her. Sometimes the agent would be in tears, sometimes she would think she was doing her best, and sometimes she felt she was trying her best but was failing. Eventually, the agent decides to go silent, peaceful, victorious, and without ulterior motives.
I was given a pensum at birth, possibly as a punishment for having been born disliked by those who dislike me. I don't remember the nature of the pensum, and I have forgotten what it is. The pensum was given to me by a person who has never spoken to me and has never listened to me, never replied to me or had pity on me, but I have spoken for my master and listened for the words of my master. I have been told by my master to speak for his master and listen for his words, but he never spoke to me. There is a college of tyrants, differing in their views on what should be done with me, who have been in conclave since time began or a little later, listening to me from time to time and then breaking up for a meal or a game of cards. My concern is with the penum, which I believe to be related to a lesson, The UNNAMABLE 313.
If I have a pensum to perform, it is because I could not say my lesson. When I have finished my pensum, I will have to reconstitute the right lesson. I have to perform the penitential before I have the right to stay quiet in a corner, with my mouth shut, my tongue at rest, my mind at peace, and my mind empty. I am struggling to find the right pensum. I find the idea of a task to be performed before one can be at rest a strange notion and open to suspicion. Possessed of nothing but my voice, the voice, it may seem natural to interpret it as an obligation to say something, but is it possible?
Mahood is portrayed as a character named Carmagnole, who has a master named 314 SAMUEL BECKETT, who is described as a being whose identity he usurps and whose voice he prevents from being heard, and who is involved in stories of a being named Mahood, whose identity is usurped and whose stories are all lies, all lies from beginning to end, and whose identity Mahood has usurped, all stories of which he prevents the identity of the being Mahood and the stories of Mahood's identity being heard. The character has promised to stop asking questions, and promises to find a happy combination which will prevent them from arising again.
The conversation takes place in a setting where a rich matter is to be exploited, fattened up and fed to keep you going for a long time. There is a character named Moran, who is described as a satrap or master. Moran's boss is referred to as Q, a character I forget his name. Moran has provided clothing and money to the character, providing him with a light touch, but the character has never paid much attention to him. The character mentions a few allusions here and there to Q, Q, and a few other characters with a view to enlisting sympathy, but eventually decides not to investigate the matter seriously.
My master is a solitary, in my image, who wishes me well and wishes my good. If he doesn't do very much in order not to be dis- appointed, it could be because there is nothing to be done. Another supposition is that he has taken the necessary steps to carry out his will and all is well with me without my knowledge. Cases one and two suggest that the master has a protege or other proteges who have taken care of me without consulting him. The master has been accustomed to giving orders and being obeyed, possibly since I came into the world, possibly at his instigation. I wouldn't put it past the UNNAMABLE master to have been commanding me to
I have a conversation with a man who keeps on dining at me and is unhappy. I want all to be well with him and try to cheer him up. I am good-hearted, on the surface, but there is no conversation between us and he has never spoken to me. I suspect that the man is unhappy because he didn't choose me. He is capable of wanting me to be happy or to serve a purpose, or both at once. I would like to know what he wants from me, but it's none of my business to ask him questions and let him explain.
I believe that there is a supreme being who seeks my good and seeks to bring him to a more reasonable frame of mind. I ask him to enlighten me in order to understand what sense I leave to be desired. If he wants me to do something for his good, he has only to tell me what it is and I will let it out with a roar. He has already told me what he wants a hundred times, but I will try and pay attention to him this time. I believe he is not solitary like me and not free like me, but associated with others who are equally good, equally concerned with my welfare, but differing in their nature.
The 316 SAMUEL BECKETT believes that continuing to be what he has always been would be better than a lame resolution, voted by a majority of one or drawn from an old hat. He has been unhappy and feels abandoned by those around him. Mahood has left him and he feels alone. He suggests that they should wash their hands of him and set him free in order to make him feel better. He invented words to say, a truth to recover, and an imposed task to perform to fulfil.
I have nothing to do and have nothing in particular to say, but I have to speak. I have the ocean to drink, so there is an ocean of words to say. There is no one to compel me to speak, no one compels me to, it's an accident and a fact. I feel a sense of Labyrinthine torment that can't be grasped, limited, or felt, and I suffer all wrong, like an old turkey-hen dying on her feet, her back covered with chickens, rats, and chickens. I hear myself howling behind my dissertation.
Mahood's stories are not just foreign but also familiar to me and to an unfamiliar native land of mine where men come and go freely and feel at home. Mahood is not the first person to tell these stories. Before him, there were others who took themselves for me, a tradition handed down from generation to generation, according to their family air. The current vice-exister, Mahood, is no worse than his predecessors and is to be executed as a billy in the bowl, with his bowl on his head and his arse in the dust.
Mahood has been in places where he claims to have been instead of staying in his domain. 318 SAMUEL BECKETT is confronted by Mahood in a domain where he is supposed to be. 318 Mahood has told Samuel about what he is like, what she looks like, and what she is like. 318 Samuels believes that Mahood will eventually admit his presence in her domain and explain how he got there. 318 Samuel Beckett is short of a leg due to a prognynme that has brought her to death's door due to senile gangrene. 318 Sammy Beckett has a hairless wedge-head and a single leg with a distinctive stigmata in the middle. 318 Samantha Beckett suggests trying Mahood with a
Mahood himself nearly coddled me more than once, causing me to almost mistake him for another man. I often dreamt of being a man and having hopes of becoming one in the future. I imagine myself among the incriminated scenes, under the attributes peculiar to the lords of creation, dumb with howling to be put out of my misery, and all around me the spinach blue rustling with satisfaction. Then they uncorked the champagne and one of us finally emerges.
After each thrust of my crutches, I consume a narcotic to measure the distance and measure distance. My head is there, broad at the base, its slopes denuded, and strewn with long waving hairs like those that grow on naevi. I had already advanced a good ten paces, not in a straight line, but in a sharp curve, which seemed likely to restore me to my point of departure or to an adjacent point. I got embroiled in an inverted spiral, a kind of inverted spiral where the coils of which grew narrower and narrower The UNNAMABLE 319 and eventually, given the space in which I was supposed to evolve, would come to an end for lack of
I found myself stuck in a room, unable to go any further. If I had chosen to set off again in the opposite direction, I would have had to have screwed myself to a standstill, which would have been an exciting experience. I had been told that the road is dull on the way out but has a different dullness on its way back, and vice versa. I have a lot of useless knowledge and consider myself a mine of useless information. If by winding myself up, if I venture into an ellipse, I don't gain much time, and I inevitably find myself stuck.
Mahood is in a state of decay and is at the end of a world tour, possibly with more than two or three centum % to go. Mahood has left his leg behind in the Pacific and is currently somewhere off the coast of Java, possibly off the Indian Ocean. Mah
SAMUEL BECKETT has returned to the fold after a long journey and is returning to his wife, parents, and children, who were born in his absence. SAMUEL has found himself in a vast yard or campus surrounded by high walls and a small rotunda in a rotunda, windowless, but well furnished, rotunda with loopholes. Samuel has been away from home for a long time and has been expecting his loved ones to be waiting for him. He believes that the rotunda is a nest where his absent ones are waiting patiently for his return.
The period of Ptomaine has changed significantly since my arrival. The children increased in stature, the ages have changed, and the ancients have shown less interest in life and more interest in discussing it. Since my arrival they had a subject of conversation, and even discussion, the same as they did prior to my arrival, and they had an interest in it. They did not want to check the impetus that was sweeping me towards them. According to Mahood, I never reached them due to a sausage-poisoning incident where they all died first, the whole ten or eleven of them.
Mahood is a character who has been absent for a year and a half. He has a missing leg. His missing leg didn't seem to affect his family when he left, suggesting he was already missing when he arrived. Mahood has a history of telling his life history to sleepy children in a bedtime story atmosphere. In the evening, after supper, while his wife kept an eye on him, the gaffer and gammer related his history to the sleepy children. His parents agreed that he was a fine baby from the beginning, from the first fortnight or three weeks of his life.
The narrators themselves, with the exception of my mother whose knees couldn't support her, could scarce forbear to smile and sing. Ptoto, the wife, announced the latest news to the audience, which was enough to cheer them up and bring them to bed with them. The narrators had been drawing near to the end of 322 SAMUEL BECKETT for a long time and were anxious about the possibility of losing ground, but Ptoto set their minds at rest by reassuring them that I had moved and there was no further proof of my progress. They kissed all around and wished one another happy dreams before retiring.
"It's your last winter," said Malone, referring to the situation in which he was in. "There was a person who was having trouble and they held him back because of the trouble he was having." Malone explains that the moment was ill-selected to give him a shock. Malone was absorbed in the business on hand and was not concerned about the nature of the business or its nature. Malone explains his feelings at this period, stating that he was unable to express his feelings due to his intense interest in the task at hand. Malone describes his situation as resembling that of an old broken-down cart or bat-horse unable to receive the least information from instinct or observation as to whether it is moving towards or away from a stable.
The character, Mahood, is a character who has a habitation and a close-knit group of near and dear ones. Mahood is well-supplied with pain-killers, but he has not consumed a lethal dose that would have cut short his functions. He is close to his goal and has no desire to reach it, but is determined to do his utmost in order to arrive. He has no time to dwell on his past and only cares about his current task, which is to go on and get on. His only care has been to obey the figure assigned to him, and he has never stopped in obedience to that figure. He often uses his halts to rub himself with Elliman’s Embrocation and to give himself an injection of laudanum.
"He's down! He's down!" is the expression used to describe a person who has fallen to the ground. "Sutik" is a character who is weak in the head and has only one leg, which is flaccid due to lack of exercise or overuse of exercise. "I had to throw away my crutches and collapse in order to be able to minister to myself in peace and comfort," according to Sutik. "They were correct in saying that I had fallen, and they were not far wrong. I have also been known to fall in- voluntarily, but not often, an old warrior like me, as I can imagine." "I stopped, taking my anodynes, waiting for the pain to abate, panting to be on my way again, and I stopped, if you insist." "He will never reach us, he'll never reach
Mahood suggested to me that I was missing a leg and an arm. I was initially sceptical, but Mahood casually let slip that I had a crutch with a homologous crutch and was able to use it to move 324 SAMUEL BECKETT using my unique foot to kick the end of the crutch forward. Mahood suggested that the misfortune experienced by my famity and brought to my notice by the noise of their agony and the smell of their corpses caused me to turn back, and from that moment on I ceased to go along with him. I decided to explain why I stopped going along with Mahood, hoping to think of something else and get back to where he was waiting for me.
I have a family, a family that has no part or share in what I was doing. My family could have moved to other quarters during my absence and settled down a hundred leagues away without me deviating from my course. I feel a sense of longing to have floundered briefly in the great life torrent streaming from the earliest protozoa to the latest humans. I have heard screams of pain and wafts of decomposition, which would have seemed to me quite in the natural order of things, such as I had come to know it.
Mahood, if he is telling the truth, lied to me to obtain my adhesion for fear of paining me. The bacillus botulinus is responsible for the extermination of my entire family, which is something I can readily admit, but only on the condition that my personal behaviour is not affected by it. According to Mahood, he is there to be pained and not to exist and be only moderately or finitely pained. Mahood has even been killed off with the friendly remark that having reached the end of his endurance, implying that he had no choice but to disappear.
Mahood has a story of his own where he is upset at having been delivered a pack of blood relations and two cunts into the Bargain, one of which ejected him into this world and the other, infundibuliform, in which he tried to take his revenge. The story of Mahood's involves two separate events, the first involving the expulsion of him from the world, and the second involving an attempt to take revenge. It has been a long time since he last knew what he was talking about and it is because his thoughts have been elsewhere that he forgives Mahood for his actions.
Samuel BECKETT was not physically shrinking when he made me turn and set off in the other direction. He caused a physiological reaction that led to a desire to vomit and the subsequent stench that compelled me to retreat under the threat of losing consciousness. Samuel B BecketT's actions were incompatible with the kind of creature I might have been if they had known how to take me. Eventually, SamuEL Becket found himself within a circular building with a single room flush with the arena, where he completed his rounds and found the unrecognisable remains of his family, including a face, a stomach, and an unrecognisable body.
Isolde's entrails are the place where I spent the last days of my long voyage and set out on the next one. Isolde could have been any breast, papa's private parts, or the heart of one of the little bastards. However, I have no preference and would have spent the same amount of time in any of these places. I was never anywhere else but here, no one ever got me out of this place. I am an infant who has been told so often how he was found under a cabbage that in the end he remembers the exact spot in the garden and the kind of life he led there before joining the family circle. I don't know what it all is.
The language I use comes from them. ! WYiat I speak of, what I speak with, and what I do is all the same to me. I have been crammed full of a language that prevents me from saying who I am, where I am and doing what I have to do. I am in a state of madness due to having to speak The UNNAMABLE 327 and not being able to except of things that don't concern me, that I don't believe, and things that I do not believe. I feel compelled to testify to them, even if it means speaking in their language. They have sworn to bring me to a state where I will be branded as belonging to their breed, which is what they imagine they will have me reduced to.
Mahood has been glutted with stories and stories and is unable to understand them. Mahood has a genius for forgetting and has the ability to absorb, which he credits to his inability to absorb and his genius for remembering. He believes that it is thanks to him that he will be able to be himself in the end. He has decided to confront those who have glutted him with lira, and to scatter them, and their miscreated puppets, and perhaps find traces of himself by the same occasion. He is aware that they haven't been pestering him for some time past, suggesting that they have inflicted the notion of time on him.
They have blown me up with their voices, like a balloon, and even as I collapse, I hear them. 328 SAMUEL BECKETT hasn't heard from them lately, which makes him suspect that they have abandoned him. 328 Samuel Beckett believes that he is not dangerous and that he has nothing to fear. 328 Samuel BecketT believes he has been walled around by their voices and is unable to express his true self. 328 Samantha Becketts believes that none will ever know what he is, and that no one will ever hear him say it, because he has no language but their language.328 Samuel Beckett believes he will say what he
I have been taught by someone to do whatever they instruct me to do, with a will to do it with a good grace until time is done. I am neither Murphy, nor Watt, nor Mercier, nor any of the others whose names I can't remember. I have never desired, sought, sought for, suffered, or sought for anything, and I never knew what it was to have, things, adver- saries, mind, senses. I know how to speak in the way they intend me to speak, and it is easy for me to repeat the same old thing I know so well, and easy to say, which amounts in the end to speak- ing in the same
Mahood has written a story called THE UNNAMABLE 329. The story is about a character named If. If intends to tell another of Mahood's stories to heighten his disgust. If is planning to narrate the story under duress, under fear, or through ignorance. If will try to present himself as if he was telling the story willingly, to keep them quiet in case they feel like refreshing his memory. If believes he is on an island and has never left it. He was under the impression he spent his life in spirals around the earth.
When I come to the coast, I turn back inland and take a course that is not helicoidal, but involves a series of irregular loops, sharp and short, with a parabolic sweep that embraces entire boglands, and unpredictable in direction, depending on the panic of the moment. I do not move and never again will, unless it is under the impulsion of a third party. I remember being a great traveller who travelled on hands and knees, crawling on her belly or rolling on the ground, leaving only a trunk and a head with which we are already familiar. The trunk and the head are the parts of myself which I have best assimilated and retained. If I turn, I can see a statue of the apostle of horse’s meat, a bust, on a quiet street near the shambles.
The police tolerate 330 SAMUEL BECKETT because they know he is speechless and capable of taking unfair advantage of his situation to stir up the population against its governors, whether through burning oratory during rush hour or subversive slogans whispered after night-fall. Since he has lost all his members, with the exception of a one-time virile, the police know he will not be guilty of any gestures that could be construed as inciting to alms, a prisonable offence. The police consider Samuel Beckett to be harmless and consider him to be a threat to no one, except for hypersensitive people who avoid him for fear of being overcome by his cattle-like appearance. SamuEL BecketT believes that the spot chosen by the police is well chosen and suggests that even those who are disturbed by his spectacle would be affected by his presence.
My face reflects nothing but the satisfaction of one savouring a well-earned rest. My mouth was hidden most of the time and my eyes were closed. My skull was covered with pustules and bluebottles, which protected me from being an object of envy and discontent in such a neighbourhood. Once a week I was taken out of my receptacle to be emptied by the pro- prietress of the chop-house across the street, who performed the task punctually and without complaint. The pro-prietress had a kitchen-garden and a tarpaulin shelter under which she kept me warm and dry.
The benefactor covered me with a tarpaulin once or twice or three times a year, which was fatal for me. However, tears began to flow when the tarp was removed and I felt gratitude towards the benefactress. I felt that the benefactor had taken care of me out of goodness and not out of pure goodness. The benefactor saw me as an asset for her establishment, as I constituted for her a kind of landmark and an advertisement, far more effective than a chef in cardboard, pot-bellied in profile and full face wafer thin. She had festooned my jar with Chinese lanterns, creating a pretty effect in the twilight and in the night, and raised it on a pedestal at her own.
The character 332 SAMUEL BECKETT is interested in understanding the language of a person who speaks a kind of language similar to that of a turnip and a carrot. The character has a preference for turnips in gravy, whereas carrots in gravy are even better. The gravy has not varied, indicating that the character's cooking methods have not changed. SAMU ELIZABETT has a deep understanding of turnips and carrots, and is able to understand the distinction between good and bad turnips, particularly Flakkee or Colmar Red turnips.SAMUEL believes that he represents for the character a tidy lift of capital and believes she would be genuinely annoyed if he were to die, which he believes would help him to live.
I am buried and have started lying again. I have been given Latin lessons in pigsty Latin and have learned it through the perjury. I believe that snow alone, provided it is heavy and heavy, entitles me to the tarpaulin. I try to make her understand that I would like to be shrouded more often, expressing my displeasure and frustration. I suspect that she has talked it over with her husband and was told by him that I was merely stifling, which is the reverse of the truth. We have been communicating through signs and she has been reading my signs and reading of them.
The story I am part of involves a series of events where I am left high and dry, with nothing for my renewal but the life they have imputed to me. I often forget how the story goes on and forget how it is supposed to end. Perhaps the story stops abruptly at the least sign of adhesion from me, leaving me stranded and unable to recover from her misfortunes. When they see me stranded, they take up the thread of my misfortunate events, judging me still insufficiently vitalised to bring them to a successful contusion alone. However, instead of resuming me at the point where I was left off, they pick me up at a much later stage, hoping to create the illusion that I got through the interval all on my own, lived without help for quite some time and had no recollection of by what means or in what circumstances, or even died. Eventually, I come back to earth by way of the vagina and reach a ripe age of ripe age and senility thanks solely to hints they had given.
They have told me that they want to give me a taste of two or three generations. If I ever succeed in dying under my own steam, they will be in a better position to assess if I am worthy to adorn another age or to try the same one again, with the benefit of my experience. 
Samuel Beckett is in a place where there is another person who will not give him quittance until they have abandoned him and restored him to himself. SamuEL BECKETT believes that the other person is waiting for him to reveal what he was and where during all this long lost time. Samuel Beckett believes that he has dwindled, he has shrunk, and he has the ability to disappear, similar to a shrunken head and shoulders when one is scolded. Samuel Beckett believes he could disappear if he were to spare himself the effort of trying to escape.
The woman who has raised me up by filling the bottom of my jar with sawdust, which she changes every week when she makes my toilet. The sawdust is softer than stone, but less hygienic, and it is less clean than stone. I used to look at myself in the blue mirrors, trying to brighten them using sawdust. Now I'm getting used to the sawdust and consider it an occupation. I open and close my eyes, as in the past, and move my head in and out, just as I have done before. I often leave the saw dust in the jar after leaving it out all night to mock and mock the woman and lead her astray.
I can't turn my head due to a stiffened neck, but I can manipulate my trunk by tossing and writhing, which allows me to change the degree of rotation required. I have lost some of my riches and probably have others that are still hidden away, waiting to be discovered by a thief. I can no longer move my head in arjd out, because of my roguish character. I used to be able to open and close my eyes as in the past, but now I can only move the head in one direction due to the changes in my neck. I now have a collar fixed to the mouth of the jar, which encircles my neck, just below the chin, and my lips can be seen by all.
The collar, or ring, of cement is an awkward piece of equipment that makes it difficult for me to turn, which makes it easier to have hallucinations. To have the same set of hallucinations, which are approximately the same as before, is a joy for me, but worries me about the prospect of being throttled if I should ever shorten further. I have always been a respiratory type and have a thorax and abdomen, which is still mine, together with the thorax, and I breathe in and breathe out, which gives me more oxygen each time I breathe. The hallucinations include the blue face, the blue tongue, the protrusion of the tongue, and the tumefaction of the penis, which surprises me as I had forgotten I had a penis. Despite having no arms, I have decided not to start manstuprat- ing again, as it would be indecent and fruitless.
I am a Clydesdale and a Suffolk stallion. flutter! Does this mean they did not geld me? I could have sworn they had gelt me, but it's possible I am getting mixed up with other scrota. fluttering suggests that I might be a part of a larger group of scrots. flutters suggests that he has been assassinated, suicided, and is now able to stand on his own feet. fluttered suggests that society has put him on the right road, led him by the ha id to the very brink of the precipice, and now it's up to him to show his gratitude to the people who brought him back to life for his service. fl flutter suggests that through the splendours of nature they dragged a paralytic and now there's nothing more to admire,
I am a character who has the ability to manipulate the wind, which allows me to create a scenario where I am transported to another place or event where I have a beginning, an end, and an end. If only I were alive inside, one might look forward to heart-failure, heart-attack, or infarctus, or to a nice little infarction. I am usually put out of their agony with sticks, usually with the idea being to demonstrate to the backers, and bystanders, that I had a beginning and end and to prove to the assembly that I was alive. I have the capacity to push, push, and go, as if I had seen him fifty years ago. I often accuse myself of inertia, but I move, at least I did, and I move against the tide. The organs of digestion and evacuation, though sluggish, seem to stir from time to time.
I am a tapeworm. I have lost heart and feel that I have all that is required to give them satisfaction. I can see myself no longer in that calamitous street they made clear to me. I feel as if I had been there, in the form they chose for me, diminished and diminished, but with the eyes open to impressions and one ear and the head obedient, and with a vague idea of the elements to be eliminated from the setting in order for all to be empty and silent. Just at the moment when the world is assembled and it begins to dawn on me how I can leave it, all fades THB UNNAMABLE 337 and disappears. I know that I will never see this place again, where my jar stands on its pedestal, with its garland of many-coloured lanterns and me inside it, and I could not cling to it.
At the next appearance, if I ever appear again, all will be new and strange, but I will get used to it, admonished by them, used to the scene, and begin to question how to live with their kind of life without assistance and assistance. I will start to ask myself questions, prompted by their questions, about how to succeed where I had always failed, and how to please the other. I have been asking myself questions about time shifts and age, and the sudden shifts of time and age.
"Two expressions, two trappings, two falsehoods, to be borne to the end before I can be let loose, alone, in the unthinkable unspeakable, where I have not ceased to be, where they will not let me be. 338 S AMU EL BECKETT something begun, something to go, as if there was something to be done. 338 I feel the moment has come for me to look back, if I can, and take my bearings if I am going to continue. 338 If only I knew what I have been saying, I would have changed my tune. 338 Despite my faults, changing my tune is not one of them.
I have to speak in a certain manner, with warmth, ease, conviction, and the right manner, as if I were a creature and not a human being. Before I can speak, I have to first think of the creature I am and then think of myself as a creature, before I can express myself. I need to express myself in a manner that is warm, easy, and confident, and as if it were my own voice, pronouncing my own words as if they were pronounced by me. I have been placed under a burden to prove that I am alive by the voices. I don't know why, with their billions of quick, quick, and trillions of dead, the voices are not enough for them, and I must contribute my little convulsion, mewl, howl, gasp, and rattle, loving my neighbour and being blessed with reason. The voices dictate the content of my words, and they are the ones who dictate this torrent of groans that choke me, the same old sour teachings.
I have a passion for the animal kingdom and I believe in the existence of another voice who does not share this passion. This other voice is waiting to hear from me. I have rccci\cd no information up to date and I have no information about it. I am a prey to communications and I speak of voices, even though I know it's untrue. I know nothing about me.
I am not in a position to receive any news concerning me, as I am not there. I have noticed that the exhortations are conveyed to me by the same channel as those used by Malone and Co. for their transports. Therefore, it is suspicious for me to believe that I might be receiving revelations of more value than those I have been expecting. My hope of receiving such revelations has been buoyed up by a moment of exceptional receptivity, but it seems to have passed from me. I think of the galley-man, bound for the Pillars of Her- cules, who drops his sweep under cover of night and crawls be- tween the thwarts, towards the rising sun, unseen by the guard, praying for storm. However, I have stopped praying for anything and consider myself still a suppliant.
They taught me in the same tongue, which was the only one they taught me. They told me there were others, but I didn't know them. They gave me orders, prayers, threats, praise, and praise for making progress. 340 SAMUEL BECKETT is a man with a white beard and a bab-bling beard, who is depicted as a child, sitting among the children, wearing an old black pinafore, and cringing from the *rod. 340 Pupil Mahood believes that Man is a higher mammal and that the lack of memory has been a factor in his lack of development and memory loss.
Worm is a solitary creature of the same breed and creed, armed with the same prong, and is the first of his kind. He has not been able to speak his mind, only murmur, and he has survived others like him, including Mahood, who is also known as Mahood. Worm is faithful and faithful, begging to be called "Worm" despite not being able to express his thoughts. Worm has the ability to communicate through his murmur. Worm doesn't like being called "Mahood".
Worm is not to blame for the situation and is not responsible for it. Mahood and Worm are both justified in their silence, and if Mahood were silent, they would have to be silent too. According to Mahood, if they were both silent, it would have been impossible for them to discuss the issue. The issue of liberty is a consideration for Mahood to consider later.
"I am engaged in a sinister operation which involves employing fifty wretches for an operation and am short of a fifty-first person to close the circuit. I do not know what I'm talking about and do not understand the purpose of the operation. The essential is never to arrive anywhere, never to be anywhere, neither where Mahood, Worm, nor Worm is, nor where I am, and the essential is to go on squirming forever at the end of the line. I've swal- lowed three hooks and am still hungry. It is a joy to know where one is and where one will stay, without being there.
Worm is the main suspect in the proceedings. 342 SAMUEL BECKETT's story, and he believes he will never be caught by any other person, even if he is caught by Worm. 342 Samuel believes that even if Worm is still after him, he won't be delivered from him. 342SAMUEL has a third line, which is for her majesty's soul, which he would have hooked her on long ago if he knew where to find her. 342Samuel has gathered together a group of four people, but they lack the hundred and first, implying that they will always be short of resources.
Worm and Mahood are characters in the conversation. Worm has the capacity to gnaw on termites in his Punch and Judy box. Worm suggests that by trying to be Worm, he might be able to achieve his goal of becoming Mahood. Mahood has the ability to note certain things, even if he does not always succeed in doing so, which is a characteristic of his governance. Worm is unable to note, despite making efforts to do so in the past. Worm seems to have already made efforts in this direction, contrary to his inability to note.
Worm and Mahood seem to be close to each other, as indicated by the fact that they are discussing the hippophagist Ducroix and the aperitif at the same time. The setting sun casts an interminable shadow across the street, creating a cenotaph-like shadow, astraddling the gutter and the sidewalk. There was a time when Worm was free to turn her head, before she was put in the collar, and she used to contemplate this shadow, but she has lost the freedom to contemplate it since being put into the collar. Mahood seems close to Worm, as evidenced by their conversation.
The meat in the restaurant has a high reputation and people come from a distance and from great distances to enjoy it. The restaurant is located just above the railings, where it is important that the prospective customer can compose his meal without the risk of being run over. Marguerite is supposed to light me up, but she is late. The menu for the evening includes tripe, a winter dish, or a late autumn one, which is usually served at this time of year. The tripe is served in a dish called a "g^jjive" which is the fruit of observations accumulated over a long period of years and subjected to a process of in-duction.
Madeleine is a character who has a habit of thinking of something new to relieve her stress. 344 SAMUEL BECKETT is in a situation where a T>ar moves over and shuts off the sky whenever he or she wants. 344SAMUEL is at the end of a vista between two blocks of buildings, at an end of the raP'iigs, where the sky appears to him, and he can see it streaming into the main of the firmament whenever he wishes. 344 Samuel is waiting for something intelligible to take place and is trying to concentrate while waiting for it to happen.
I am a human head, recently washed and with a few hairs on top. I live in a place where hungry people are compelled by the position of the menu and are compelled to post themseiVcs. I am aware of the presence of hungry people and children who pass by my place on their way to and from their play- grounds beyond the gates. I feel a sense of anticipation and curiosity about my existence, a feeling which can't be attributed to the dogs that come jesting against my abode. I have no smell, and yet if anyone should have a smell, it is I.
I consider the concept of change pregnant with possibilities and consider it a principle of change. me. I have declined in recent times and consider myself to be in no fit condition to receive the testimony which I consider indispensable. However, if T succeeds in dying, and J decides to adopt the most comfortable* hypothesis, I would be unable to believe I ever lived. I know that it has happened to me many times before, without their granting me a brief sick-leave among the worms before resurrecting me. Therefore, I consider it an excellent thing that I should be going downhill fast. Perhaps some day some gentleman, chancing to pass my way with his sweetheart on his arm, will exclaim, loud enough for me to hear, that he is ailing and should call an ambulance.
Mahood once knew a doctor who held that scientifically speaking the latest breath can only issue from the fundament, rather than the mouth, the orifice to which the family shoiftd a mirror before opening the will. Mahood believes that she was mistaken in supposing that death could be considered evidence or a strong presumption in support of a preliminary life. She no longer has the desire to leave this world without some kind of assurance that she is there, such as a kick in the arse or a kiss, and she is willing to let two third parties remark her, there, before her eyes, to ensure her safety.
In 146 SAMUEL BECKETT, Samuel Beckett has abandoned a rich vein of narrative due to exhaustion and is considering abandoning it due to the use of first person pronouns. Samuels Beckett finds himself in a place called Rue Brandon, a place he has never heard of in his island home and is unfamiliar with. Samuel Beckett is trying to connect his presence in Rue Brandon with the unhappy Madeleine and her great goodness.SAMUEL Beckett believes that Madeledine's attention to him and her acknowledgment of his presence attest to his substantiality. Samuel Beckett considers the evidence against him and his potential sentence, but he considers it highly
The woman is losing faith in me and is trying to put off the moment when she must confess her error by visiting me every few minutes to check if I'm still in situ. She has been lavishing attention on me for some time past, a change from the serenity of their earlier relations, when I saw her only once a week. The belief in God is sometimes lost after a period of intensified zeal and observance, as indicated by the jar mentioned above. I doubt that I am in the jar, but I wouldn't dream of denying it's existence. I believe that she loves me and that she needs me.
Mahood, the chief witness, suggested to me that a woman named "The UNNAMABLE 347" was responsible for sequestrating me. I initially thought she was a near relation, mother, sister, daughter, or even a wife, but she didn't say "The UnNAMable 347". The suggestion is not preposterous and accounts for certain bizarreries which had not yet struck me at the time of its formulation. The woman has never spoken to me, to the best of my knowledge. If I have said anything to the contrary, I was mistaken and if I say anything again, I will be mistaken again.
The lanterns have not been lit on the same evening as usual. Marguerite has come and gone without my noticing her. The stables are silent, the railings are silent and I am half-deaf, and I often find it difficult to hear the stables' muffled sounds. It is cold, it has snowed this morning, and yet I don't feel the rold on my head. Perhaps I am still under the tarpaulin and she has flung it over me again for fear of more snow in the night.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is experiencing a feeling of being entirely en- closed and feeling nothing touching her. 348 SAMU ELBECKT has placed her concerns before her responsibilities and believes she has placed them before their responsibilities, suggesting she has been let go. 348 Samuel believes that she has left Mahood's world, the street, the chop-house, the slaughter house, the statue, the city, and the sky through railings, which she describes as a slate- pencil-like pencil. 348SAMUEL believes that Mahood has realised the stories of Mahood are not about her and that she is the one who has won, having tried hard to please him and be left in peace. 348 Samuel believes she will no longer hear the lowing of cattle, the clinking of forks and glasses, the angry voices of the butchers, the
I have no ears, no head, no memory, and no memory. My function is to announce what is going 5n and pass on the news. I say what I am told to say in the hope that some day they will weary of talking at me. I seem to hear them say it is Worm’s voice beginning, and I believe it to be Worm's voice speaking. I have an ego and believe I have the ability to speak of it. I believe they are trying to trap me with a trap to make me believe I am an ego all my own. I don't believe they won't catch me in the end, but I wish they wouldn't.
Worm and another character are in the same galley. Like the mother who whistles to prevent a baby’s bladder from bursting, there is another character in the galley who has the ability to interact with others. Worm has the potential to be the anti-Mahood and is seen as an anti-Worm by Mahood and his team. Worm is not aware of himself, his senses tell him nothing about himself, and he knows nothing about the world around him. Worm exists but not for himself, for others, others conceive him and say he exists, as if there could be no being without being conceived.
In 350 SAMUEL BECKETT, Samuel identifies a character named Worm as the truest posses- sion, the most unchanging, the one outside of life and the one who is not spared by the need to speak, to think, to know where one is, during the wild dream, up above, under the skies, and venturing forth at night. 350SAMUEL suggests that life will tell him how to live his life, and he longs to have lived while he was alive. 350Samuel suggests that if one seeks the true countenance of Worm, they will find it.
Worm is a character who has no voice and has no reason. He has been portrayed as a character with no voice or reason. Worm has confused himself with Worm due to his lack of voice and lack of reason. According to Worm, the voices and thoughts of the devils who beset him are not his own, but those of those he perceives as devils.
Worm and Mahood are two characters in a roleplay scenario where Worm has failed to be Mahood and has to be Worm. he. Mahood is a character who has the ability to understand certain things but doesn't need explanations. he believes that when he is Worm, he will become Mahood automatically. he is tired of being matter, matter, pawed and pummelled endlessly and is ready to be whatever they want. he suggests that if they could only begin to do what they want with him and succeed at last, he would give up and let go.
They are all of the same kidney and yet they don't know what they want to do with me. They describe me as dust and want to make a man out of me. If I could find a voice of my own, it would end their troubles and mine. They try to lull me with little silences to make me break them. They think I can't bear silence and fear that my horror of it will force me to break it.
Mahood, Murphy, and others have spoken before, but it was clumsily done by a ventriloquist. J52 SAMUEL BECKETT has forgotten who Worm is, where he is, what he's like, and has forgotten about his college quips. If they ever succeed in getting J52 to give a voice to Worm, he hopes to succeed in making it his own, possibly in a moment of euphoria or confusion. However, Mahood did not speak, and it seems to me that others did, too, but they did not. According to J52, Worm is no longer he, but he is still present and capable of feeling pothing, knowing nothing, capable of nothing, wanting nothing, until the moment he hears a sound that will never Stop.
Worm, who thought he was different, finds himself in a mad-house for life. He has been listening to a sound that is monotonous beyond words and monotonic beyond words. He is in a coma, but hopes to rebound towards others, possibly regaining consciousness before regaining his coma. Worm is aware that he is no longer he, but a kind of tenth-rate Toussaint L’Ouverturc due to the sound he hears.
The conversation takes place in a realm of nature where the nuisance is a voice and other noises are even more unpleasant and can be relied on to make themselves heard. variety. variety at the end of I know not what eternity, they don't say, this has sufficiently exasperated my intelligence for it to grasp that the nuisance can be a voice. variety, and it has taken him a long time to adapt himself to this realm. variety and his predispositions for man’s estate. variety of roses mentioned in the conversation, which he will smell before he's finished and he will put the accent on the thorns. variety
I don't yet know how to move, either locally, in relation to myself, or bodily. I don't understand how to want to, and I want to in vain. What doesn't come to me from me has come to the wrong address. My understanding is not yet well-oiled to function with the pressure of a critical circumstance, such as a violent pain felt for the first time. For some, the concept of a n?*urc to accelerate the march of the hours, could not retain my attention. For others, the time-abolishing joys of imper- sonal and disinterested speculation, and for others, it is time-consuming and time consuming. My familiarity with lights, which are merely one example of these lights, gives me nothing in return for familiarity with them, they invariably give me to
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who has the ability to scorch, causing his phlegm to shatter and sparks to spirt and dash against the walls. He seems to be in a head, which is visible above and a little to the right. Samuel Beckett has a terror of being frightened by another's thoughts and feels a longing for safety, surrounded on all sides by massive bone. Samuel BecketT has a voice which has denatured him, causing him to feel confused and confused, and he often feels as if it's going to abandon him, but he believes it's merely a passing weakness and hopes it will teach him hope. Sam
Worm is the name they call me by. They are trying to get me to admit that I am he whose name they are calling me by and no other. They want to wipe him from my memory. They have brought me to a certain point where I remember what I was like when I was he before all became confused and I could become Worm again if left in peace. The transmis- sion is described as "really excellent" and suggests that if only they would stop talking for nothing, pending their stopping everything, it would get us somewhere. Worm suggests to me that it is not for me to judge, that it's more provocation.
Worm is a foul brute who is capable of varying his voice, tone, accent, and drivel. He has a habit of being the same foul brute all the time, amusing himself by pretending to be a many, varying his register, his moustache, and his accent. Worm has a history of long silences during which he does not say anything. I can hear murmuring, indicating that they are putting their heads together again. I don't hear what they say, but I know they are still there, they haven't done anything with me, and they have moved a little aside. Worm seems to be alone, taking counsel with himself and preparing for a fresh flow of inanity. I am in a state where silence falls and I hope there is no one left.
Mahood, a character, is facing the same problem as the scytheman, but not the same age. Mahood believes that if they go back as planned, they will fall forward as projected, but the reverse would be more like it, with them falling forward by a fraction of a century or more. The character begins by the ear, which is the way to talk, whereas before it was the night of time and now it's the radiance of conversation, indicating they know where they are and consider their origins as a subject of conversation. Eventually, Mahood begins to be familiar with the premises and begins to wonder if he can sneak out by the fundament, one morning, with the French breakfast, but he can't move, not yet.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is an unthinkable ancestor of whom nothing can be said. They want Samuel to be born, and they have set their hearts on that. The past is the same as in the past, and the present is similar to the past. SamuEL has failed to be conceived, and he is an impenetrable age when he was an impotent being. SamUel has been weakened by their attempts to weaken him and is in need of restoration. Samuel is willing to accept their terms for peace at any price for the sake of peace.
The conversation takes place in a setting where a head is being referred to and referred to. Mahood is aware of the head being spoken of and hears it being spoken about. The head is referred to by the same person, which makes Mahood question why they continue to say the same thing. If the head is referring to Mahood, it's because Mahood hears it and believes that things will change one day. They hope that one day an abscess will form on a wind-pipe or other section of the conduit, with an idea inside, which could lead to a general infection, which would allow Mahood to jubilate like a normal person, knowing why and being able to carry on as a "normal person". Mahood believes that if he were flesh and blood, he might agree with their idea, but as a human being, he feels nothing.
The narration is set in a scenario where a person is suffering from a pain in the neck and flies are devouring them, and the heavens can do nothing to help. The narrator suggests that the heavens could have warned the afflicted person about the dangers of the flies before they start to devour them, which would have prevented them from being devoured. The narration suggests that if the howl of the howler were to be heard by the heavens, they would have warned him before the howling began. If they were to have warned me before they started, it would have been obvious that they were aware of the dangers and could have predicted their impending doom.
A series of sounds, recurring without pause, are all it takes to sprout a head, a bud to begin with, and eventually a huge bud, with the function of silencing and extinguishing when the eye joins in. 5he.se is a starting-point for the conversation, and it is a voice that speaks to him, and he believes it has the power to speak to him. The conversation takes place in a place where he is alone, far from all men, out of range of every voice, but he is aware of the words they keep telling him of. He knows they are words, but is unsure if they are his, and hopes one day he will make them his.
I have not spoken yet, but I know that what I hear is not the innocent and necessary sound of dumb things constrained to endure, but the terror-stricken babble of tTie. I would have pity, but they are severe, greedy, and perhaps more greedy than when I was playing Mahood. I can hear SAMUEL BECKETT through one ear and in the other ear, which is possible due to multiple instances of error. I have the ability to hear two holes and me in the middle, slightly choked, or a single one, entrance and exit, where the words swarm and jostle like ants, bringing nothing away and bringing nothing to leave a mark. I will not say I again, because it's too farcical, and I will put in a third person, whenever I hear it, to please them.
Worm is in a state of extreme distress, unable to breathe yet. His thorax is showing signs of wear and tear, rot spreading down his body, and he has the possibility of crawling. There is a faint, hissing hissing noise, which he interprets as the breath of life being recalled to those whom it corrodes. There are lights that go out hissing, which might indicate his distress and terror. The lights have been there for so long that they may have made a hole in the wall, a little hole to glue their eyes to, to observe his progress. Worm's only noises until now are those of mohths and the groaning of the air beneath him.
He is in a place called THE UNNAMABLE 359 where he is unable to learn and has a head grown out of his ear. He knows no more than on the first day, he merely hears, and suffers, uncompre- hending. When on earth later on the storms rage, drowning the free expression of opinion, he will know that the end of the world is not at hand. The head has grown from his ear and is glued to the ear. It is a transformer in which sound is turned, without the help of reason, to rage and terror. The circumvolutionisation of the head will be seen later when they get him out of the place.
They all speak at the same time and say the same thing simultaneously, often perfectly together. But often they all speak simultaneously and do not move from their places. God alone can fill the rose of the winds, without moving from his place. Worm, who says nothing, knows nothing yet. Those who benefit from the peep-hole, those who care to use it, are those who are most likely to benefit from it. The peeps, or "catechists" as they are referred to, have the ability to make remarks based on what they have seen and their interest in it. They have no pedagogic purpose in view and have no intention of imparting any instruction to Worm. The catechist's tongue, honeyed and per
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is a shapeless heap with no face capable of reflecting the niceties of a torment. The disposition of the heap is expressive and allows specialists to assess the chances of it making a bound, or dragging its coils away, as if stricken to death. Somewhere in the heap an eye, a wild equine eye, always open, is evident. SAMU ELIEL has an eye and he is possessed of an eye. Samuel can't think, he can't judge anything, but his kind of flesh is good enough and he will try and go where peace seems to be, drop and lie when it suffers no more, or when it can't
Worm is being pursued by a group of people who want him to retreat from a certain quarter. They are making a physical barrier to prevent him from going any further. When he is unable to go any further, he will drop, assuming he had risen, as a reptile can drop after a long flight. It will be Worm's first experience of vertical support, the vertical shelter, and reinforcing those V>f the ground. Worm will never know the joy of feeling a prori and buckler for the first time. Worm is being restored to the state in which he was before the beginning of his prehistory.
Worm is described as a being who can't set himself in motion and has the ability to move, which is a blessing and a curse for him. Worm has a life-warrant and he often desires to stir from where he is, seeking a little calm and something of the silence of old. However, he is unable to do so due to his lack of movement.
Fen is in a pit, a vast place with no access to the air in which he lies. The air in the pit is not for them to breathe, yet they want him to breathe theirs. They do not dare to go and fetch him from the pit because they believe he hears them. The pit is too vast for a dog to reach, even with a long pole and a hook attached. According to the latest news, Feen will have to climb to reach the pit.
The slopes are 362 SAMUEL BECKETT gentle that meet where he lies, they flatten out under him. The slopes are not a meeting, it is not a pit, and the slopes will soon have him perched on an eminence. They don't know what to say, how to believe in him, what to invent, and how to reassure him. They launch their voices into a hole, hoping to dislodge him in the hope of dislodging him. Samuel Beckett hears their voices and is within reach of their gaffs, hooks, barbs, and grapnels, and feels saved at last, home at last. He believes their usefulness is over, but he doesn't want them to leave.
He is alone and mute, lost in a strange hell that has no heating, no denizens, and is surrounded by smoke. He hears a voice, which he interprets as the voice of the blest interceding invisible, intercessing for the living and for the dead. He understands nothing about the voice and believes it is a voice of those who mourn them, envy them, call on them, and forget them. The voice is incoherent and incomprehensible, but he understands it as necessary for him to understand just a little, almost nothing, to avoid repeating the same filth flung to him like a dog that always gets the same orders, threats, and threats.
The eye stays open and does not have any lids. It is an eye without lids, where nothing happens. If he could blink, he might miss an odd sight, and if he could close the eye, he would never open it again. The eye has tears gushing from it practically without ceasing, possibly caused by rage, passion, or grief. Perhaps the eye weeps in order not to see. The rascal is getting humanised and is going to lose if he doesn't take care.
Worm doesn't understand what is going on, he doesn't know what they want, doesn't take thought, and doesn't feel anything. However, he feels, he suffers from a noise, and he knows it's a voice. The noise makes him suffer and he under-stands it. Worm hears the voice and knows it is a voice, but only a few expressions and intonations. Worm has changed, according to the voice, and is now described as grave, gravid, gravely grave, and gravely gravid. The eye is there to put him to flight, make him take fright, and to break his bonds. According to them, the eye has the power to
The conversation takes place later in the evening. There is no sense in bftkering about pronouns and other parts of blather. Worm being in the singular, they are in the plural to avoid confusion. SAMUEL BECKETT ing is involved in the conversation. Samuel Beckett ing has the ability to communicate with more than one person at the same time, but he might get mixed up with his victim, which would be abominable and potentially masturbation.
Worm is a character with yellow, pink, urinous and w'arm color, and a nice grew of the kind recommended as going with everything, with no superfluous particulars. Worm suffers from the noise which prevents him from being what he was before, and he is suffering from this noise that prevents nothing. He craves for a stick, an arm, fingers apt to grasp and then release, a stone, stones, or a power to utter a cry and wait for it to come back to him. He suffers from having neither voice nor other missile, nor limbs submissive to him, and may even regret being a man.
The camera can neither see it nor lift it up, it remains trained on the same tiny field, a stranger to the boons and blessings of accommodation. It is hard to see how Worm could stay and it is hard for him to go. However, impossible situa- tions cannot be prolonged, unduly, as they disperse or turn out to be possible after all. There are lights, in the plural, which rear aloft, swell, sweep down, and go out hissing, reminding one of the naja. Perhaps the moment has come to throw them into the balance and have done with this tedious equipoise.
Worm is an impotent, impotent crystalline. He hopes for nothing but for things to continue as they are. He is indifferent to the things one has to put up with and considers them insignificant to him. He believes that there must be something of everything in every world, a little of everything. Grey is the colour that goes with everything, which goes with his grey-grey appearance.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is a visitor who passes by at a distance at a regular level once a month. Samuel Beckett has a full face and profile, like a criminal. Samuel Beckett is faithful and faithful, with his visiting-day and visiting-hour, never staying too long, providing the necessary time for hope to be born, grow, languish, and die. Samuel Beckett believes that space and hope have taken to going hand-in-hand in certain quarters because it's safer. Samusel Becket is waiting for his sweetheart and the flowers, and people would think he was deSd.
"Some^'simple thing, a box, a piece of wood, to come to rest before him fpr an instant, once a year, once every two years, and every three years, with a frequency unimportant in the early stages, but important in the later stages. If this thing were to stop, it would be better than nothing, he would learn to count, fret, be brave, have patience, lose patience, and be faithful. If the event were to start off, his heart would be on its waltz, in his ear. tralatralay pom pom, re mi re do bang bang, who could reprehend him?"
The conversation takes place in a setting where the protagonist is waiting for something or someone. The protagonist is calm, calm, passably calm, knowing that nothing has befallen her and that nothing will befall her. She sees her place and her place has nothing to mark it, there is nothing to dis- tinguish it, and she wishes none of the other places apart from her own. She is aware of her place, she sees it and feels it around her, it enfolds her, and covers her. If only the voice would stop for a second, she would know if it was going to start again or if the conversation was stilled for ever. She would keep on listening to try and advance in their good graces, keep her place in their favour, and be ready in case they judged fit to take her in hand again. She fears that one day she might stop listening, fearing the worst, but is open to the possibility that a woman's voice might engage a soprano.
Worm seems to be trapped in a situation where he has to be Worm. Worm is riveted to the situation, unable to escape. Worm feels a voice telling him to report in the light, the light of day, in their midst, to hear them say, "We didn't tell you you were alive and kicking." Worm has endured a lot, but he feels nothing. Worm should have fled from the situation but he's riveted. Worm can't move, he's rooted, as if he were rooted. There are no bonds around him, no bonds if you like, and the earth would have to quake to dislodge him. Worm's grip is like sargasso, like molasses, and he doesn't know what it is. Worm has the ability to
The scene takes place in a place where there is no air, no sound, and there is only light. There is a discourse taking place, which is suspicious and suspicious. The calm that precedes life seems to be disturbed by the noise of the discourse. SAMUEL BECKETT bubbles are bursting all around, indicating that there's no air in this place. The place is described as a place of light and dark, where air is to make you choke and light is to close one's eyes. The light is created by the lamps, which make the environment grey. When the lamps go silent, it will be dark, with no sound and not a glimmer, but they will never go.
They filled up the holes with lamps to prevent them from closing of themselves. They didn't know what to do after departing and fixed their lamps in the holes to prevent the holes from closing. They used power- ful lamps, lit and trained on the within, to make the individual think they are still there, despite the silence. The individual suffering from the grey is not alone, as he suffers from the noise and light, and the grey also comes from the light. If the master commands them to come back, they will do so, even if they don't know they have gone.
Worm believes that the lamps unattended will eventually stop working and go silent, indicating that they will eventually become black. However, he believes the lamps may come back after long after the lights are spent and after the master has pleaded for years in vain to convince him there is nothing to be done. Therefore, if the lamps are left unattended, then all will start over again and there will be no further explanation of the nature of the silence which it inspisses. Worm believes that he will never know, as long as the silence lasts, whether it is final or just a mere lull, and he will have to listen for the murmurs of olden silences and hold himself ready for the next instalment.
Worm sees the light in a desert, the light of day, the same as every other day in every other desert. His long shadow will follow him across the desert, causing him to squirm and he weep. According to his master, the master explained to him how to cause suffering, and the master instructed him to do this, do that, and he will see the light and hear him weep. Despite the suffering caused by seeing the light, Worm has no objection as long as it causes him no harm. The ozone is the only thing that matters in the desert and it sterilises, according to the master.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is an idea they have, a word they use when speaking of them, and he is at the centre of this idea. SAMU ELIZABETT suffers from a grey light, which makes him suffer. The grey light would make him suffer more and more if he tried to escape from it, but it's obvious the light would lessen as he went towards it and drive him back to the wall, which would lead to the blaze, capture, and the paean. As long as he suffers there's hope for him, even though they need none, to make him think he's on the right road and as long as they need him to suffer, they don't need any hope. Samuel Beckett makes no noise, he doesn't make any noise, but he makes a little whining.
In this scenario, the patient suffers as much as he did on the first day, and continues to suffer more and more as time flies, suggesting a metamorphosis into an unchanging future into an unchangeable past. However, if the patient is given lessons in keeping quiet, he will be taught to toss and turn and roll on the ground in order to relieve the monotony of his suffering. In the scenario where the patient has been burnt alive, there are those who rush about in every direction, without method, looking for a little cool.
An individual is searching for relief from self-diligence and the alleviation of flight from self. He is looking for a palliative for what he is through no fault of his own. He seeks to imitate a hussar who gets up on a chair to adjust the plume of his busby. He doesn't need to go far to find such relief. No one asks him to think in order to despair. The individual suffers in the same way, with no hope of diminu- tion, without hope of dissolution. The monotony of the situation is stimulating to him, but he finds it monotonous. The individuals who work there are doing the best they can with what they have at their disposal and are paid for.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is part of a group of fake maniacs who use a trick to trick Samuel into thinking he is doing something he doesn't know. SAMUel has a tendency to forget what they're saying and to forget all they say as fast as they say it.SAMUEL has blackouts where he forgets what he's saying and remembers a second behind them, allowing him to blurt it out as received, while also remembering the next part of the conversation, which he believes is none of his business. SamuEL believes he might have blackouts due to his memory loss.
The conversation takes place in a setting where the speaker is in a dungeon. The speaker expresses a strong desire to escape from this place and to have the words that will save him or her from punishment. She believes that her crime is her punishment and that her punishment is what they judge her for. She feels like a pig, dumb, uncomprehending, and possessed of no utterance but theirs.
The dark is not necessarily an oubliette for one, or one other, and it is possible that I have a companion in misfortune who is given to talking, or is condemned to talk, out loud, without ceasing. I think that I might have such a companion, but it would surprise me if they loathe me. I doze off from time to time, with open eyes, and yet nothing changes. Gaps have always been present in my life, whether it's the voice stopping or the voice failing to carry to me. They shut me up here and are trying to get me out to shut me somewhere else or to let me go. They are capable of putting me out just to see what I’d do.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where words have been said, but they need to be ratified by a proper authority before they can be implemented. The speaker, the speaker, knows the verbatim report of the proceedings and is responsible for choosing the words that count. In the meantime, the voice continues, the messenger goes towards the master and the master examines the report, and the messenger returns with the verdict. The words continue until an order arrives to stop everything or to co-operate with the proper authority.
The conversation takes place in a place where one waits to know one's fate, as if one is waiting for a respite. There is a sense of uncertainty and uncertainty about the meaning of the words that pour out of one's mouth. The words don't carry any more and one has to listen without reason, as one has always done, because one day one begins to listen and the listening begins. SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that there is something about not being able to die, live, be born, staying where one is, not knowing where they came from, or where they are, or how they are going, or if it's possible to be elsewhere, and being unable to go forward or back.
"There is nothing for it but to wait for the end and wait for it, and at the end all will be the same as before.""There was a time in the past when there was nothing for one to do but to get to the end, or fly from it, or wait for its arrival, or to get through it. There is a voice that prevents one from being nothing and prevents them from being nowhere. The voice is a meaningless voice that keeps alight a little yellow flame, darting from side to side and panting, as if straining to tear itself from its wick. Regretting helps one move towards the end of the world, because regretting what is and regretting the past is what gets one on towards the future.
Mahood is in a state of despair and regretting not being able to bear any more. Perhaps Mahood will emerge from his urn and make his way towards Montmartre singing, "I come, I come and I come, my heart's delight." Perhaps Worm, also known as Worm, will also be unable to bear the stress of his condition. If I were a tradesman, I would set rats on Mahood, water-rats or sewer-rats, to help him make up his mind.
They make a mistake in thinking of Mahood as if they speak of him as if he exists in a specific place, whereas he is only a project for the moment and the whole thing is no more than a project. Mahood's existence has been insufficiently studied, leading to confusion and disquisitions about his existence and potential reality. They are compelled to speak of something that is already established and accessible to understanding, such as something the existence of which has been established.
They don't know who they are or where they are, nor what they're doing, nor why everything is going so badly. They don't achieve what they want, and they don't understand the obscure infamy to which they are committed. Therefore, they build up hypotheses that collapse on top of one another, leading to chaos and chaos. The gang is not the same gang as a moment ago. They are all in the same boat, each one in his own peculiar way, and each one has been scandalously bungled.
SAMUEL BECKETT describes a blind voice and the moments of held breath when all listen wildly for signs of life. SAMUEL believes that if all that could stop, there would be peace, as if a sign of life escaping someone escaping would be denied if it could be denied. Samuel suggests that the blind can hear better and are more generalizable, suggesting that they have more general knowledge than those who are not blind. Samuel believes that Mahood is the one who is responsible for the blind voice.
Mahood is a great weeper who weeps for even the smallest things and is cold as a fish, incapable of cursing his creator. Worm, also known as Mahood, is a weeper and his beard is soaking with muck, which doesn't relieve him in any way. Worm and Mahood seem to have the ability to forget everything, and it is feared that Mahood will never let himself be completely resorbed.
Mahood is stuck up to his skull in his vase, opposite the shambles. Mahood is exceptionally given to the tear and would have preferred this matter to be kept dark. MahOOD has no vent at his disposal and is unable to express his feelings. Mah Hood is expecting the passers-by to perceive him ostensibly, concomitantly with the day’s dish, or independently, possibly for reasons unknown. He believes that such perceptions are guaranteed to sink, and that he has no choice but to remain where he is.
Samuel Beckett is questioning the ability to think and speak at the same time. Samuel believes that one cannot think and act simultaneously. Samuel Beckett suggests that people repeat the same old litany, the one they know by heart, and are in a self-reproach, which prevents them from thinking of different ways of saying things. Samuel Becket suggests that without a special gift, one's thoughts wander, their words drift, and their thoughts and words become far apart. SamUel Becket believes that if one were to suffer, rejoice, and feel bereft of speech and thought, they would be in a place where they would feel nothing.
They are a lucky group of people who are there to bear the responsibility of this state of affairs. Even if one doesn't know a great deal, one knows enough to know that one would not care to have it on one's conscience. They are voluble and have the capacity to make one believe they are responsible for the situation. The master is not a high official and they don't intend to approach him unless they are driven to it. The family circle is more intimate and they all know each other, there are no surprises to be feared.
It is a place where one sets out to look for a face and returns having found nothing but a kind of ashen smear, possibly a long grey hair, greasy with ancient tears, or the fringe of a mantle spread like a veil, fingers opening and closing to try and shut out the world, or fingers, hair, and rags mingled inextricably. The face is a thing to be seen and not something to be found. The character is hairless and naked and his hands are in no danger of ever getting into mischief. He does not believe in the eye and believes there is nothing to see, nothing to
The conversation takes place in a setting that is not particularly interesting and offers little interest to me, but I am willing to accept it because it is my turn to be shown impossible. I believe that this will never end and there is no sense in fooling oneself. I think that after me, it will be the end of the conversation, because after me they will give up, believing that they have been told a lot of lies. The third party, the master, is the one to blame for the current state of affairs. Neither the master nor the other suspects are innocent, neither are they, and they were foolish to accuse one another. They are all innocent.
The conversation takes place in an arena after the massacres, where there is a sense of utter silence and utter chaos. There are people who are expected to depart or drop to the ground and never move again thanks to a person who could understand or do anything due to their duty to tell her or him what to do. However, they are beginning to come around to my opinion, which is that I have one, and they make me say, If only this, if only that, but the ide? is theirs and the idea is not theirs. As far as I am concerned, there is every likelihood of my being incapable of desiring or deploring anything whatsoever. SAMUEL BECKETT is supposedly from a place called 3&0 and he doesn't know what it is or what he is meant to
The bright boy of the class is the one who always comes to the rescue when things go wrong and saves situations. He has saved more than one person and has the ability to stimulate the spirit and stop the rot with the use of one word. He suffers from suffering, which initially dampens his joy, but he quickly makes up for it by invoking the celebrated notions of quantity, hrfoit-formation, wear and tear, and others. He is in a position to declare inapplicable to the case before hiita, as his wits are limitless and he is capable of applying them to any situation. He questions if they have ever done anything else during the past, and asks what he is doing in Mahood's story and Worm's.
"The UNNAMABLE 381" is a man with a criminal record, including insults to policemen, indecent exposure, sins against holy ghost, contempt of court, impertinence to superiors, impudence to inferiors, deviations from reason, infractions of the law, and insults to superiors and infractions against inferiors."The UnNAMable 381 has no convictions and has a record of insults, infidelities, infidelity, corruption, and infidelity. ""The man has a history of multiple soft softenings, multiple softings, painless ulcers, multiple hard- enings, insensitive to blows, sight failing, chronic gripes, light diet, hearing failing, hearing irregular, heart irregular, sweet-tempered, smell failing, heavy sleeper, and no erections. "The man's father and mother, both dead at seven months intervals, were at the conception and at the nativity.
The conversation takes place in a setting where there is a human shape. The human shape has a painful moment on the surface and a peaceful underbelly. There is a person present in the photograph who appears to be in a state of distress. The person in the photo is depicted as a person dying on his feet. The individual in the picture is identified by the name of a person who has not stirred and has not said anything.
Samuel Beckett is in a place where Mahood and Worm are unable to get him out. Samuel Beckett sees himself as a different type of person, different from all the others, and believes he is the only one like him. He believes that if there is only one person like him, he can depart without remorse, having done all he could and achieved the impossible and lost his life to achieve it. 382 SAMUEL BECKETT is used to announcing his decisions at the top of his voice to get to know people better and to cover' all
He has been having a dream about a scenario where he and another person, unknown to each other, meet unbeknownst to themselves. The scenario involves the two of them being trapped in a situation where they are unaware of each other. The role-play takes place in a world where the other person is trapped and has no idea what has happened to the other one. In this scenario, the role-playing character has to coax the other character out of the situation and back to his family.

I THE UNNAMABLB 383 is weary of pleading an incomprehensible cause and decides to drop among the con- tumacious, nice image of the Pulit- zer Prize. The Pulit Zer Prize is a form of punishment intended to catch spermatozoon alive for the purpose of killing him. The sperm is not in a womb and the slut has yet to menstruate, which narrows the field of research. I consider myself to be a sperm dying, of cold, in the sheets, feebly wagging its little tail, perhaps I'm a drying sperm, in an innocen
Mahood and Worm are characters in a notorious story that is notorious. Mahood is a character who has been involved in a series of stories that are notorious, and Worm is a person who has yet to engage in a conversation with Mahood. Despite the notorious nature of the stories, Mahood believes there is nothing to be gained from them and that they will never learn sense from them. He has his own stories, and he believes that if he tells them, it will be the end of their stories.
"Be bom, dear friends, enter my arse and you'll just love my 084 SAMUEL BECKETT colic pains." Samuel Beckett has the flux, which he describes as a form of birth-induced colic. Samuels Beckett believes that people will learn from his experiences that it's not as easy as it looks, that one must have a taste for it, and that it requires being born alive to experience it.
I used to have the duty to bring back to the fold the dear lost lamb, a person I had been told was dear to me, dear to him, and that they were dear to each other. However, I no longer have the capacity to do so. I have been thinking about this person for a long time and have been trying to find him all my life, wondering what he could possibly be like and wondering where they could possibly have met. Until I joined him, I was de#r to them and now it's they who are dear to her. They are a group of renegades, and they will join us, one by one.
T is alone in a place where she believes she is the first and the last and she is responsible for her own suffering. T believes that she has never made anyone suffer, she has not stopped anyone's suffering and no one will ever stop hers. She believes she will never know peace and neither will they, with the difference that they don't want it, they say they don’t want peace and they say she doesn't want to suffer. The voice in T's head is saying that she suffers and that she would feel better if she did this, and that it would make her feel The UNNAMABLE 38 $ better. T doesn't know how to understand what the voice is talking about, but she believes that if she does not know about these things, how would she
The conversation takes place during a public show, where the audience buys a seat and waits for the show to begin. The audience is expected to be waiting for the compulsory show, which is a recitation, selected passages, old favourites, a poetry matinee, or an improvising performance. The voice of the stage-manager is heard in the background, giving instructions and recommendations before the curtain rises. The stage-man is alone in his dressing-room, only preluding, clearing his throat, alone in the dressing room.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is alone, waiting alone, in the rest-less air, waiting for something to begin or for something else to start. SAMU ELIEL is blind, deaf, blind, or possibly deaf, and he is waiting for a hand to come and draw him away from his current situation and take him somewhere else for free, gratis, and for nothing.SAMUEL has a preference for a certain thing, but he doesn't prefer it any more and he prefers something else.
I believe that I have been deceived by someone and that their attitude towards me has not changed. Moreover, I don't understand what they were trying to do to me. I say what I'm told to say and that's all there is to it. I feel a jostle of words in my mouth and wonder if there is a mouth on me, but don't feel any mouth or head. I do not feel a mouth, nor a head, nor do I feel an ear. I believe that the "'ords" are there, somewhere, without the least sound, but I don’t feel that either.
I feel something but I don't know what it is. I feel an outside and an inside and I'm in the middle of the world. I can hear and understand what is being said but I can't understand what it's being said. I'm the thing that divides the world in two, on one side the outside and on the other the inside, with a thin, thin surface that can be thin as foil. I am neither one side nor the other of the partition, I have two surfaces and no thickness, and I feel myself vibrating. I perceive myself as the tympanum, on the one hand the mind and the world, but I'm not part of either of them.
The UNNAMABLE 387 believes that they know nothing and think they never change, and that they will continue saying the same thing until they die. The UNNOMABLE 387 considers themselves immortal, stating that they can't get born and can't change. They believe that they have saved a man and that for him, his troubles will be over and he will have a good time, a brilliant career, and will forgive himself.
"I go mad, but I don't know what kind of madness I go mad with.""It's possible to go mad at any time of the day or night, and I'm not sure which one it is.""The shadows are all that matters, only the shadows, with no life of their own, no shape and no respite.""I depart, towards my brethren, who depart without knowing where they are going, not knowing if they will ever return to their master.""There is a possibility to sue for their freedom, it's pos- sible, and it's just possible.""They stop to listen to my screams, they will stop from time to time, but they will never stop again.""My screams will stop, I'll stop screaming, to listen and hear if anyone is answering, to look and see if anyone's coming."
Samuel Beckett is a character in a political discussion. Samuel Beckett proposes a scenario where the structure of the system is unchanged and there is no change in the structure. Samuel Beckett suggests that if there were to be a change in structure, the system would need a disturbance or subsidence to start things off, and the disturbance would spread to every part of the structure, resulting in a disturbance that would eventually lead to a disturbance in the whole structure. Samuel Becket suggests various forms of travel, including business trips, pleasure trips, research expeditions, sabbatical leaves, honeymoons at home and abroad, and long sad solitary tramps in the rain. Sam Samuel Becket indicates the main trends, athletics, tossing in bed, physical jerks, locomotor
I am currently involved in an ongoing affair, but I don't know what it is about. I feel stuck in some process and haven't yet come to an understanding of it. I know that I've got nowhere to go in the affair. The affair galls me because they want me there somewhere, anywhere, if only they would stop committing reason, stop focusing on me, and focus on the purpose to be achieved. I have no illusions about having begun one day or ever being able to conclude the process. I find it difficult not to look forward to his end and to look back to a time he did not exist. I believe that there is nothing special to be done and nothing doable to do, and there is no point in telling stories to pass the time.
The conversation takes place after the events of the story "The UNNAMABLE 3?9".9 The story is about the same old thing being told to pass the time.9 The stories have been telling themselves for as long as anyone can remember, possibly longer than the events in the story.9 According to the conversation, time seems to pass without any particular reason, as if time didn't pass for no reason at all. 9 The characters are seeking the cause of their stories, trying to find the cause and never ceasing, seeking for the cause, losing and finding it again, and seeking again.
The speaker is talking incessantly, seeking for something to do, but doesn't know what it is yet. He suggests that they should seek over there and seek out a pertinent objection before seeking something specific. He is talking unceasingly, seeking incessantly in himself, outside himself, cursing man, cursing God, stopping cursing and continuing to curse. He believes that Vdiere is man and seeks to understand who he is, what he is seeking, who he's seeking, and what he's done to them.
I am in a place where I've always been and have always been before. I am mute. I can hear others talking to me, talking of me, but I am unable to understand what they want or what they are talking about. I question who is talking, who is not talking, and what has I done to them, God, and the others. I believe that we are innocent, we have done nothing to God and he is innocent, and we have nothing to do to him.
The character 3S0 SAMUEL BECK ETT is struggling to understand what is going on around him. He is doing his best to understand, but is unable to do his best. The characters he is speaking with are like him, expressing frustration and despair. He stops trying to understand and stops trying. He believes that he is alone and has no need of anyone or anything. He feels nothing, as if he is talking, thirsting, starving, and in an ice aid in a furnace. He doesn't feel a mouth on him, and he doesn't need a mouth any more. The words are everywhere, inside him, outside him, even though he used to have a mouth. He has no thickness, no need for a head, and no need
"I'm all these flakes, meeting, mingling, falling asunder, meeting and meeting again, meeting again and again. I'm a particle of me, retrieved, lost, lost and gone astray.""I am all these words, all tl^ese strangers, this dust of words, with no ground for their settling, no sky for their dispersing, coming together to say, fleeing one another, merging, merging and never meeting. I am something quite different, a wordless thing in an empty place, a hard shut dry cold black place, where nothing stirs, nothing speaks, and I listen and I seek, like a caged beast born of caged beasts, born in a cage and then dead, like such a beast.
"The fury is past and fear is present, but there is nothing left but fear of sound, of beasts, the sounds of men, and of men. There is only one continuous sound, continuous, day and night, and it is the sound of steps coming and going, voices speaking for a THE UNNAMABLE 311 moment, the air, and bodies groping their way. The sound of the air is the air among the things, it's the air that I seek, like it, like me, in my own way.
The conversation takes place in a silent place with thick walls, where all is silent and the walls are thick. The conversation is about how one manages to manage without feeling an ear on her or a head, or a body or a soul, and how she manages to do what she does. According to the conversation, it's not clear what is going on in this place.
"I am seeking something and it is tiring in the end. I am trying to understand how I manage to do what I'm doing under such conditions.""I must find out what I’m doing and how I managed to do it." "I hear what you're doing and I want to know how it's possible." "You say I hear and that I seek, but it's a lie, I seek nothing, nothirfc any more, no matter, let's leave it, no harking, and let's listen to them now, jogging my memory." "How I manage, to understand, and to hear and to understand"
SAMUEL BECKETT 3$2 is a simple arithmetic equation, consisting of a hundred thousand, a million, and a hundred dollars. SAMUEL is not in a fortunate position to have grasped all the expressions in the equation, but he feels compelled to give in and acknowledges that there is I, which he feels is essential and it's preferable. Samuel is aware of the distinction between I and a noise, which is likely to be the topic of their next deliberation. Samuel is prepared to take advantage of the opportunity to sum up the situation by saying that there was I on one hand and the noise on the
I have only just Jaken over my functions and I and this noise. I am doing my best to understand the nature of the noise. The noise seems to be inverting the natural order, which is something we would seem to know for certain, among other things, what follows.
It is not possible to determine with certainty or even approximately what the noise is or how it comes to me, or what organ it comes from, or by what organ or organ it is emitted. It is difficult to determine the source of the noise. The noise can be influenced by perception or intelligence.
The investigation into The UNNAMABLE 313 is taking longer than expected due to the nature of the topic. The investigation has yet to establish with any degree of accuracy what I am or where I am, and whether I am words among words, or silence in the midst of silence. I recall only two hypotheses launched in this connection. I have the ability to hear and to communicate, and I can't stop speaking without ceasing, indicating that I speak without stopping and that I long to speak. I use ellipse ellipses to communicate.
I find, find, lose, find again, throw away, seek again, and never throw anything away. I have never lost anything and have never found anything that I might have thrown away. If it is I who is seeking, and if it's not I, I see nothing else for the moment. I conclude that there is nothing else I can do to pass the time. I question why time doesn't pass, why it piles up all about you, accumulating on all sides, deeper and deeper, thicker and thicker, and why it buries you with no memory, no hope, no knowledge of anything, no history, and no prospects.
"Time doesn't pass, just like that, off the record, en passant, to pass the time.""I think that's all, for the moment, and I see nothing else.""If it's T, I don't want to ask any more questions, if it's not T.""Resolutely, resolutely, more resolutions.""Make abundant use of the principle of parsimony, as if it were familiar to me.""Assume that the thing said and the thing he^rd have a common source, without specifying where exactly, and locate this source in me, without considering the consciousness of third parties and, more generally speaking, of an 394 SAMUFL BECKETT outer world."
The protagonist has overcome a fatal leaning towards expressiveness and has chosen to create a world of his own, sometimes referred to as the inner world. He has decided to abandon his past self and take advantage of his new soul and substantiality to abandon, with the only possible abandon, deep down within. Something has changed, but he has not mentioned Mahood, or Worm, for the past.
I have wasted a lot of time with these bran-dips, beginning with Murphy, who was not the first. I spent time on the prem- ises, on the outskirts of the city, and on the streets, surrounded by real people, living in solitude and neglect. I have doubts about the existence of the world and have no faith in it. Murphy and the others, including the two old buffers present, could not stop the things that happened to me. The UNNAMABLE 3$5 is the only thing that matters to me and nothing else.
I am not at home and my doors are shut against them. They are howling and the maws are now howling. I consider opening my doors and letting myself be devoured by them, hoping that by doing so, I will find silence and peace. I have visited the depths and sailed for two visits to the depths during which I was unable to drown. It is 1 am and I am far away from my doors, far from my walls. I find myself in a strange mixture of sojfd and liquid, where was 1, my subject, who is no longer there, or no longer the same, or has gone missing. My subject is still there, still in the same place, but no longer
Samuel Beckett is a youth who is looking for his mother to kill her. It's raining and he is walking along a street with great yaws to left and right. SAMUEL BECKETT is searching for a means of staying among the living, of getting off with his life, and of escaping from his self-doubt. Samuel Beckett sees nothing when he looks with closed eyes, only the same as with open eyes. Samuel Beckett is wondering what it would be like to be unable to lose one's self. Samuel BecketT asks himself a question about what it is like to see nothing, to see no matter where he looks, to be eyeless, and to see the little creature in his various guises.
I am equipped with eyes that can open and shut, possibly blue, and I have a head where all manner of things are known. I am also equipped with a head that can communicate. I have the ability to speak, but only when I speak no more. I now have a name for the latest surrogate, a man with a doll's eyes and a head filled with vile certainties and his doll’s eyes. I will have to describe him in greater detail to understand his capabilities. I no longer crawl between the thwarts, under the moon, in the shadow of the lash, and after the rats.
The setting is described as a place described by The UNNAMABLE 397 as an unusual hell, described as being beneath the earth, with no air, no sound, no sight, no movement, and no movement beyond a score of fathoms, where men come and go and you dream of them. The dream involves a place where you can see grass, grass at dawn, glaucous with dew, and grass at sunset. The eyes of the dreamer are not mine, they're not mine and can only open and shut by the force of habit. The head of The UnNAMable 397 is not a head, but a solid, solid bone, and he doesn't go anywhere. He has been lashed to a stake, blindfolded, gagged to the gullet, and gagged, but he is impervious to the shafts.
The conversation takes place in a setting where the voice of a character is failing and the character is trying to find air for the first time. The character's voice has failed many times before and has even stopped many times in the past. When the voice stops speaking, the character goes silent for lack of air, but the voice will come back and the conversation will begin again. The voice is broken, faint, unintelligible, and if the character listens hard, it will flare up like a kindling fire and emerge from silence.
The silence is the one that I have tried to earn, the one I thought I could earn. If it is the true silence, it will be like everything else, murmurous with muted lamentation, panting and exhaling of impossible sorrow, like distant laughter, and brief spells of hush. The silence will be the same as ever, long or short, the same silence. Unless this time it's the real silence, when I have said something that gives me the right to be done with speech, listening, and hearing. SAMUEL BECKETT knows that no matter what he says, the result is the same, that he will never be silent, never at rest.
There is no one left to talk to and there is a sense of peace unless one tries to say what needs to be said about them. Unless I try once more, one last time, to express what I feel is a mistake or sin, I will have nothing more to say and nothing to hear until I die. I feel it's about me and that I have made a mistake and that this is my sin. I'm glad that there is no more one left and I'm going to try again.
The story takes place in a scenario where someone is talking to you about you, about him, another person, and a third figure, who all appear at the same time, giving you an idea of what is going on. Then the character goes silent and the conversation is short-lived, as if they had forgotten about it. Eventually, these figures depart one by one, leaving only the voice of the person talking to the character. The voice is not theirs and is not speaking to anyone else but the character, suggesting that it is the one talking to them. As the character's breath fails, it's nearly the end, but she hears someone calling her.
The conversation takes place in a place where there is no one left to talk to and there is nothing left for one to talk about. Even if there were things, a thing, a scrap of nature, that one could talk about, it would be difficult to reconcile the idea of being the talker. If there were such a thing to discuss, even if one couldn't see it or know what it was, one might have the courage to do so. The conversation suggests that to go silent is to be punished for having gone silent, implying that one will be punished if they do not go silent. In this scenario, the person who has gone silent is punished for not talking, and the punishment is to begin again.
The story takes place in a wilderness, with a voice that describes time as a chronicle and every second as the worst. The narrator is three seconds old, has been away, done something, or been in a hole, and has just crawled out of a hole. The narration describes the passage of time as jerkily jerky, with no flow and no flow, as seconds pass, they arrive, bang, bang and bounce off, bounce off and fall and never move again. In order to remember what she has said, the narrator has to repeat the same thing over and over again.
I remember two names: Worm and Mahood. Worm's name is Worm. Mahood's name was Mahood, but I don't remember seeing him any more. I can still see Worm, better than I can see me, and I know how he lived. I remember talking about him and the same words recur in my memories. I invented Worm, Mahood and many others in order to sfeak, without speaking of me. I was never told to speak of me, so I invented my memories without knowing what I was doing. I thought 400 SAMUEL BECKETT would suit me.
I have experienced three things in my life: the inability to speak, being silent and being unable to be silent, and being alone in a place where no voice can reach me. I did what I could to do a thing beyond my strength and often for exhaustion I gave up doing it, yet it went on being done. I have heard a voice being heard, a voice which could not be mine since I had none left and yet which could only be mine, since I could not go silent. Now I can speak of my life, but I'm too tired for niceties. I don't know if I ever lived, and I have no opinion on the subject. I think I will soon go silent for good, despite it being prohibited.
I have been speaking for a long time and have spoken a lot, which has made me feel as if I have spoken long and valiantly. I thought about going silent before being dead in order to be able to enjoy living in silence. I don't know why I wanted to be silent before death, but it seems to have been a desire to return to the place where I always was and could never rest in peace. I didn't want to die as a stranger in my own land, in the midst of strangers, surrounded by invaders. I imagined many things while I was talking, with longings and visions merging in one another, causing me to go blind.
The conversation takes place in a setting where things are happening in a certain way. According to The UNNAMABLE individual, things didn't start the way they are happening now. The UnNAMable individual doesn't believe what she is saying and doesn't know what she's saying. She is doing as she always did and is going on as best she can. As to believing she will go silent for good, she always believed it, as she has always believed she would never go silent. However, she does not believe it particularly.
If I had a job to do, such as sorting things or arranging things, and I had to move things from one place to another, then I would know where I was and how far I had gone. However, if I had the job of moving things, I wouldn't be able to know where or how far away I was from the place I was going. I can see it from her#, which suggests that they would contrive things in such a way that I couldn't suspect the two vessels to be emptied and filled.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where a person is responsible for filling and emptying containers of water with a thimble. The containers are described as being com-plicated, less symmetrical, and arranged in accordance with certain homo-logies. Each container is made up of four or a hundred parts, half of them to be filled and numbered, the other half to be emptied, numbered, and filled in a certain order. The container is connected to a network of pipes under the floor by pipes and taps, and the pipes are visible from the platform. If I had a job with fluids, filling and filling, always the same vessel, I would enjoy it.
Samuel Beckett believes that the quicker one does something, the more important it is to listen to. 462 SAMUEL BECKETT believes that it would be dark and impossible to do such work in the dark, and that there is no window from where he is. 461 SAMU ELIZABETH believes that water has great value and the least drop spilt on the way or in the act of drawing or pouring would cost her dear, as demonstrated by the fact that she couldn't be dextrous and couldn't tell a story from the dark. 463 SAMUel Beckett has told another little story about herself, about the life that might have been hers and about the difference it would have made for Jywe if she had made it through the process.
The fable involves a character who comes and goes a lot, moving around his casks, dropping hili thimbles, listening to his thimble bouncing and rolling on the floor, scraping around for it with his foot, and going down on his knees and crawling. The character has never seen himself before, and he doesn't remember ever making acquaintance with anyone before. However, the fable takes place in a place where the character sees himself coming and going and trying to stop his hand from trembling. The fable ends with the character saying that he will never see the character again, but he will see him again. He believes the character will come back to keep her company.
I have decided to speak only about myself. I have decided not to talk about anyone else. I believe that I am always ageing and that ageing makes no difference. I am good at describing places, walls, ceiling, floors, doors, windows, and locations, which is a speciality of mine. I've experienced many places, some opened on the sea and some closed on the sky, some were wordy-gurdy-like, others were doorless, even windowless. If I could shut myself up in a room, it would be a mine and I would find a way to explore it.
The place is described as a place where 1M would like to get to know it and remember it. 1M has tried to describe the place, but she doesn't feel any place around her. She doesn't know what it is, describing it as being like air and feeling no place. She feels like there is no end to her and doesn't have the ability to describe it. One of the places she describes is a solid lump, solid in the middle, in a corner, and propped up on three sides. She describes the place as solid, solid, and well-propped up.
I have memories of a sea under my window, a row- boat, a river, and the river, but none of them are mine. I remember a time when nothing was too good for me and others benefited from it. I have tried to recall these memories, but they are not mine. If I could be in a forest, caught in a thicket, or wandering around in circles, it would be the end of this blither.
Samuel Beckett, 494 SAMUEL BECKETT, has experienced a traumatic event that has taken the heart out of him. Samuel Beckett's heart isn't in him any more and he wants to find himself in his own little corner. Samuel Beckett is tired and wants to stop, travel, seek for himself, stop seeking, lie no more, speak no more and focus only on his own thoughts. Samuel Beckett notices that the others have vanished completely and doesn't like it, but he goes on as best he can to cope with the situation. Samuel Bennett believes that he has passed by this event and that it will pass on and some-thing else will be there.
"I will remember it as I go along, all adown it, thinking that I will be born and born, births and births, and come to night without having been. I look at Tunis pink, it's dawn, and I want to shut myself up and make a place, but I don't feel any place for me. I will make Mt. mine and put myself in it, hoping to put someone else in it as well. Perhaps the place will keep me and someone else, keeping them inside each other and the place all around them. "I will close my eyes and talk, all I have to do is talk, I'll have things to say about me, about my life
The conversation takes place in the early morning hours of a given morning. The conversation is about a person who has been called to call that morning and is struggling with a choice. The words "the dayspring" and "the bright stain" are used in the conversation. The person has a strong sense of smell from the stable, indicating that she always smelt the stable. She decides not to seek her home any more, fearing that it would be occupied and someone would be living there already who would not want her. She considers asking questions to find out what she should do.
The protagonist has come back from a far place and has not done anything else all his life. The protagonist has a knack for topography and is good at describing topography. When plans fail, there are always aspirations to return to the place where one has come from. When a plan fails, the protagonist has time for a cud of ljnging to rise up in the back of his gullet and to look as if he enjoys it.
Laughter helps to get you over the "pretty pass" or "pretty things you have to listen to". It's not me speaking, it's not I hearing, and I'm not the only one in the world, whereas others are absent or absent from it or with others. Others are not obliged to make their self-presences manifest, and all that is needed is to wander and let wander, like a slow boundless vWiirlwind. Someone speaks, someone hears, and it doesn't matter if it's I, or another, or others. I know who I am and who I know I cannot say I am.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is trying to understand what it is to speak, to hear, to know nothing, and to be capable of doing anything, but is unable to do so due to the overwhelming noise that patties her away. 406SAMUEL believes that she is not herself and is not capable of understanding what it means to try and understand what is happening to her. 406 Samuel asks for someone to speak to her of him and let her speak of him, as she has never asked for anything and never asked to be spoken of. 406Samuel believes that if she could forget him, she would deny him, with pleasure, if that could help her.406 SAMUel has no one left for her to speak of, and there is only one person left.
I have forgotten my apodosis. I was nearly there and was nearly sleeping, but I don't hear any more. I hear a horrible noise coming back from a place where I was sleeping. I know that it's not my fault and there is no one but me, there was never anyone else but me. It's I who does this thing and I who suffers it, it's impossible for it to be anyone else's fault. I have no objection to the term "sleeping" and consider it a form of reasoning. Before they deserted me, they must have taught me reasoning. I don’t remember the period before they deserted but it must have marked me.
"The UNNAMABLE 4W thing" is a strange phrase that keeps recurring in the conversation. "I have always been here, there was never anyone but me, never anyone else, I've always been churning old slush to be churned everlastingly, a minute ago it was dust, now it's slush, and it must have rained. I believe in progress and believe in believing in progress, I know how to believe too, they must have taught me believing. I have never learnt anything, no one ever taught me anything."
He speaks of me as if I were he or someone else, as if he lived, or saw some who had, and as if others were others. He claims to be the afflicted, and he speaks of himself as far away. He seeks me out and wants me to come out. He wants to be he, or another, or to rise up into him, or up into another, to be fair and impartial. He believes he has caught me and feels me in him. He refers to me as Murphy, or Molloy, or as if 1 were Malone, and wants none but himself for me.
Samuel Beckett is a character who can't move, can't talk, and can only talk. Mercier, Moran, and I never spoke. Samuel Beckett believes he speaks because he perceives himself speaking as if he were someone else. Samuel Beckett perceives confusion as a sin because he doesn't know who or what he is talking about. SAMUEL BECKETT believes the confusion is caused by the use of pronouns, and it's the fault of the pronouns that he has no name or a pronoun for himself.
The conversation is about a man on duty who speaks of himself. Neither he nor the woman he is speaking of is concerned with any specific person or thing. They are concerned with speaking of something that is unknown to them, whether it is a person or something that exists anywhere, or is present in their environment.
I don't know who or what is going on and I don't have any idea who it is about. I think it's about him who knows nothing, wants nothing, and can do nothing. He is described as a person who can't hear, cannot speak, and has no capacity to do anything. I have no opinion and I have nothing to say. I can't feel a Hiouth on me, which means nothing to me, and I feel nothing.
I know it's not me, and I know that I am far, far away. I don't feel The UNNAMABLE 4Q9 any arms on me. If I could feel something on me, it would be a starting-point, a starting point. I know what it is, but I can't do it, they must have told me what it was. I have no idea how to do it. Perhaps it's one of those gifts that can't be acquired. The silence, a word on the silence, in the silence is the worst, to speak of silence and then lock me up, lock someone up.
I'm in something, but I don't know what it is. I'm creating a place, a little world, which I believe will be round, but it's not certain if it will be low, low of ceiling, thick of wall, or low of floor or high of ceiling. I am trying to find out what it's like to create this little world and to put someone in it. I have no idea who I am or how I would manage in this world. Perhaps it won't be me in the world created by me.
Someone must have explained to me what it's like to have an eye, an eye looking out of a window, at the sea, the earth, before the sky, and against the air, opening and shutting, grey, black, grey and black. I must have understood what an eye is, because I wanted it, wanted the eye for my own, and tried to understand it. The things they've told me and the things I've tried have been useful to me, and they come back to me in useful ways when I think of them. The old thoughts are old thoughts, shreds of old visions, they call them.
Samuel Beckett believes that the devil showed him how to speak and what to say in a dark place, how to interact with people, and how to communicate with nature. Samuel Beckett also believes that Mahood, like Mahood before him, showed him everything he needed to survive in this place. SAMUEL BECKETT believes that he has existed in rooms, in sheds, in caves, in caverns, in woods, or in rooms or caves, and that he is lost. Samuel Beckett doesn't remember who went away and left him, leaving him feeling tempted and lost. Samuel Becket
I believe in progress, I believe in silence, and believe in a few words on the silence. I believe it is possible to create a world where I am far away or stowed away somewhere, hidden away behind walls, for the rest of eternity. I think that if there is only one space and someone within it, it will be enough to sustain me for eternity. It is evening already and I call it an evening. I wish Y&U could see it and believe it this evening. When there is an end to an evening, someone speaks of it.
They love each other and marry in order to express their love better, more conveniently. He goes to the wars, he dies at the wars and she marries him. He comes back from the war, but he didn't die at the war. She meets him at the train station and he dies in the train, of emotion at the thought of seeing her again and having her again. She goes back to the house, he's dead, the other one is dead, and the mother-in-law takes him down, he hangs himself. She weeps, weeps louder, at having loved him and at losing him. The story taught me the nature of emotion, what emotion can do given favourable conditions.
The protagonist is a character named UNNAMABLE 4U, who is portrayed as a mother-in-law. The character has a son who is described as a "unnamable 4U" and cries. The protagonist finds the house-door bolted after returning from the station. The door, which is a wooden door, is believed to have been bolted for some purpose, possibly to teach her how to reason or to tempt her to go to a place where things can come to an end. The story suggests that the person who bolted the door is the daughter-inlaw or the son, not the son and the daughter, as indicated by her cries.
I am in a place where there is a silence, and I emerge from it to speak of it. I don't understand duration or duration of the silence. I know I speak of the four seasons and the different parts of the day and night, but I can't remember how long I've been there. I remember the words they taught me without making their meaning clear to me, and all the images they showed me were on lists with images opposite. I mixed up the names of the nameless images and called them by their imagelcss names instead of their real names.
In a dark place, in the dark, there are azure, blank words that I use to represent a life. I use these words because they represent memories of events that happened in the past and I need them to be able to go on. I need the memories to represent the past for me to continue living. I consider a score as a palette for the memories, mixing them and varying them to create a gamut of emotions. If I could, I would mix them, mix them and vary them to represent all the things I would do if I could and if I wished.
I have drowned more than once. I have been suffocated, set fire to me, thumped on my head with wood and iron, but there was no head, no wood, no iron, and I didn't do any harm to myself. I believe that I am the one who has drowned. I don't know what the real silence is, but I know that there is no real silence. I want it to go silent, but it doesn't.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where the conversation falters and stops every instant, but stops every few moments for a good few moments. There is a murmur, a small voice, a mouth, throat, mouth, ears, and a car filled with vomit. The voice is small, only small enough to stick in the throat and fill the car. Someone vomits, someone starts vomiting, and the conversation drags on. The narrator believes that the comma will come where she will drown for good. She has no explanations to offer, none to demand, and no one to demand.
The conversation takes place in a vast, vast and possibly infinite prison, described as a hundred thousand cathedrals. The prisoner is described as being riveted, tiny, and riveted in the space, possibly in a tiny, riveted prison. The prison is vast enough for a whole people to be in it and large enough for the prisoner to be found. If the prisoner were to give up before giving up, he would have the opportunity to start again in the prison and start again from a different place.
 SAMUEL BECKETT 414 is alone, possibly the first or possibly the last person talking alone, listening alone, and listening alone. The others around him have been stilled, their voices stilled and their listening stilled by the new-com- ing, indicating that they are no longer present. Samuel Beckett is confident that he will be with the others and that they will also be as silent as he is.
The conversation takes place in a parlour, where one waits for their turn to talk, listen, and wait for the next turn to go. It is a long circuit, described as an unending one-way system, with no end in sight. The speaker is waiting for her turn to enter and exit a place where she does not know where it is or what it's like. She doesn't know if it's big or small, if it is closed or if it’s open.
The speaker is on a rock, lashed to a rock and in the midst of a great swell of silence. The speaker perceives an image that is an image and a body, but it is not her. She perceives herself inside something and believes she is in something. She feels shut up in the silence and sees nothing but the voice and the silence outside. She believes she needs walls, good and thick, for her alone and wants to go to a prison.
The voice is blind and seeks me blindly, seeking me blindly in the dark, seeking a mouth to enter into, who can query it, and who can check it. The voice is waiting for me to say I'm someone, to assert that I'm somewhere, to put me out, into the silence. I see nothing, which could be because I have no eyes or because I don't have any eyes at all. I have the ability to choose from a range of possibilities, but I can't see anything. I believe that the voice is not The UNNAMABLE and it is not possible for me at this moment to tell a lie. I look too often as if I
The entity has no interest in eyes and claims to have none. The entity speaks of tears and gleams, indicating it is at a loss. Glaces are described as appearing at dawn, then dying at evening, flaring up, and then fizzling out, indicating they can be short and dazzling. The entities has the ability to create hypotheses and create illusions, as in the case of the entities mentioned above. In this scenario, the entities use glaces to trick the mind into thinking they know something, which is a form of deception.
SAMUEL BECKETT has created a memory which is like a confession, a last confession, and an indictment. The memory is bad, the words don't come, the breath fails, and the words fail to come. The voice in the memory tells Samuel everything he needs to know, in dribs and drabs, in breath-less, breath- less, and it speaks of his sins, his sins and his head. The head speaks of Samuel Beckett's sins and says that he wants to repent, wants to be punished, and wants to go and give himself up. Samuels Beckett believes that a culprit is essential for the memory to be accurate, and that a ^ictim
I have a body endowed with despair and I believe it will best me in the end. I believe that this body will tell me what to do in order to move, act, and act like a body imbued with despair. I don't feel a body on me and I can't stir, indicating that I'm not suffering enough yet. I hear myself reasoning, which is how I reason. I have the ability to hear, but not to understand or profit from what I hear. I only hear, without understanding, and without being able to profit from it.
It is not my turn to understand, understand, or live, it's not my time to live. I hear everything, I understand everything, and I know the space of the way from here to the door. I know that all has been said and all must have been said, but I don't have the ability to know what I am, where I am and what I should do to stop being it, stop being there, and become another person. I can depart into life, travel the road, find the door, find an axe, or use a cord, a cord for the neck, for the throat, or for the cords, or fingers. I will have eyes and fingers, but it won't be me.
I have heard stories about travellers and stories about atjout paralytics, all of which I believe to be mine. I believe that I am extremely old, or it's memory playing tricks, and if only I knew if I've lived, if I live, or if I'll live, it would simplify everything. I haven't stirred, and I know something else, but I always forget that. I have been telling these stories to myself, wondering where I got them from, where I store them, and where they might be stored.
It's an old habit for me to ignore something and continue to ignore it, as if I were absent or absent. It's his turn again, he who neither speaks nor listens, who has neither body nor soul, and who is made of silence. He is in a state of silence and is the one to be sought, sought for, spoken of, and spoken of. If he couldn't speak, I would be Ifc, I'd be the silence, and we would be back in the silence. His story is the story to be told, but he has no story, he is in his own story, unimaginable, unspeakable, and unspeakable.
The story of the silence is a story of a place, a place where he never left and a story about the silence that he has never left. The place, the silence, and the story are all words that make up SAMUEL BECKETT's memories. SAMU ELIZABETT is aware of this place and this story, but she doesn't know how to describe it. SAM
The words that remain from an old story carry her into her story, which she has forgotten. She has forgotten about this story. She believes it's too late for her to return to it. She is at a door and believes she has been there for a long time without knowing it. The murmurs, the distant cries, and the murmurs are part of her story. The story she is telling is the only one she has ever had and she believes it to be the only story she ever had.
The conversation takes place in a place where there is a silence and a dream-like atmosphere full of words and murmurs. There is a person who is waiting for them there. The person believes that they are going to stop and abandon them, which could be a good few moments of silence or a lasting silence that lasts for a lifetime. If the silence doesn't last, the person will wake up in the silence and never sleep again. If it doesn't stop, they are likely to carry the person to the threshold of their story before the door opens on their story.
