Metamorphosis
His room, a proper human room
Getting up early for work.
I’m going to make a change in the alarm clock.
How long will Gregor be waiting for the next train?
When he first heard his own voice
His father went back to his breakfast, but Gregor had no intention of opening the door.
Breaking the chains: the first time he tried to do it in bed
When he had finally got his head out of the bed.
The Alarm Clock and Allosteric Motions
Ten years’ experience with opening the door to a stranger
The last time I checked my watch.
A new look at the chief clerk in the family: he’s gone on the early morning
A new look at the way things are done in the kitchen.
Why was he crying?
I’m here on your terms.
I’m feeling alright.
Gregor the Impediments of Self-Renewal
Alarming the way he said it: Gregor the voice of an animal
He coughed a little bit.
Turning the key: Gregor pulls the lock from his pocket
The last time he saw the door.
The last time I checked my watch.
I’m going to work my way out of it.
The last time I went away from the office.
Lethal and silent tears in the presence of his sister and the chief clerk.
The last time he touched his body.
His mother was not far from the table; she had forgotten the chief clerk’s name and wanted to see him again
Gregor’s father had a go at the chief clerk.
Gregor and his father had agonism over the decision to turn round.
All he had to do was push himself through the front door.
The last time he ate breakfast.
A new look at the family: readings from the bedside to the bench
A quiet life for Gregor.
No-one is watching over his shoulder.
A new look at the beginning of life with Gregor
All he ate was his sister’s.
His first taste of life.
The last time he ate his dinner.
When he was little and she was still very young.
His mother had been gone for a while.
Gregor had a good time in prison.
He had a secret plan to give his sister a place in the conservatory at Christmas
His father had gone back to work.
When Gregor's mother had to go and earn money
He might go back to the window.
A new look at the beginning of life with Gregor
Gregor and his sister have been arguing in the basement for months now.
Gregor and his mother had a very long time to wait outside the door to see his sister.
Gregor had his first birthday.
Gregor’s new way of entertaining his sister.
He’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone
His mother’s voice still there: Gregor is learning to walk
His mother’s permission for Gregor to crawl in the dark- and light-adapted mouse house
His mother looked at him with a smile.
The last time he saw his writing desk.
Grete and his mother had a go at it.
All she wanted was a slice of her own blood.
Lethal, silent, and then: Gregor’s reaction to his mother’s knock at the door
Gregor and his father had a go at it.
Can he stand up straight?
Gregor was able to run up and down the stairs without stopping his father
The last time he saw an apple.
A new look at the beginning of the end: Gregor in his wheelchair
Watching old friends: quiet is back.
Gregor’s father would wake up early to try to persuade him to go to bed early
If he had been in charge of his own bed.
The last time I said goodbye to my maid.
Gregor’s mother and sister sit at his bedside with tears in their eyes
All he wanted was attention.
His mother had not been able to do anything about it yet.
When Gregor’s mother refused to let her son into the house
A beginning of the end: no-one is watching her.
The last time he ate.
The last and the beginning of the end of the line
The last time I ate with my father and stepmother.
A new look at the old problem.
His mother had made preparations for a son to play with the violin.
A little boy with a big appetite for hearing music
His sister had gone to bed with him.
A neighbour gone mad: Gregor and his violin
Alarming the neighbours: I give immediate notice on my room
A new look at the beginning of the end: Gregor’s father is gone, and his mother is still there
Gregor’s sister cried out in tears.
Gregor’s sister: he’s just gone mad.
A beginning of the end: Gregor pulls his sister out of his wheelchair and starts to run round the house
A new look at the gates of death
When he thought he’d gone home.
The last time I saw her.
The last time I saw my mum.
