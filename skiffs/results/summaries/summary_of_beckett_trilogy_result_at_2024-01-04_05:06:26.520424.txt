 Samuel Beckett is in his mother's room and sleeps in her bed . He doesn't know how he got there but says he was helped by a man who comes every week . He says: 'I don’t know how I got there. I was helped'
 "I piss and shit in her pot. I have taken her place. I must resemble her more and more. All I need now is a son. Perhaps I have one somewhere. But I think not. He would be old now, nearly as old as myself .
 All grows dim. A little more and you’ll go blind. It’s in the head. It doesn’t work any more, it says . You go dumb as well and sounds fade. The threshold scarcely crossed .
 It was on a road remarkably bare, I mean without hedges or ditches or any kind of edge . cows were chewing in enormous fields, lying and stand- ing in the evening silence . The road, hard and white, seared the tender pastures, rose and fell at the whim of hills and hollows .
 Samuel Beckett and his friend stopped, face to face, on a deserted road . They turned towards the sea which, far in the east, loomed high in the waning sky, and exchanged a few words . Then each went on his way .
 From there he must have seen it all, the plain, the sea . and then these selfsame hills that some call mountains, indigo in places in the evening light . But now he knows these hills, that is to say he knows them better .
 The man was innocent, greatly innocent, he had nothing to fear, though he went in fear . It seemed to me he wore a cocked hat . It was a stout stick, he used it to thrust himself onward .
 A man, a fortiori myself, isn’t exactly a landmark, because, I mean if by some strange chance he were to pass that way again, after a long lapse of time, his eyes would search out the rock . No, he certainly didn't . I watched him recede, at grips (myself) with
 A or C, I don’t remember, going resignedb' home. wildly. He was bare-headed, wore sand- 12 SAMUEL BECKETT shoes, smoked a cigar. He moved with a kind of loitering indolence which rightly or wrongly seemed to me expressive .
 The little dog followed wretchedly, after the fashion of pomeranians, stopping, turning in slow circles, giving up and then, a little further on, beginning all over again . Constipation is a sign of good health in pomerans .
 MOLLOY 13 is a novel by Dutch writer Willem de Klerk . It is about a man on crutches who tries to catch up with a mangy dog . The author says he knew he could catch the man, he just had to want to .
 I’ve disbelieved only too much in my long life, now I swallow everything, greedily . What I need now is stories, it took me a long time to know that, and I'm not sure of it .
 Once again I am, I will not say alone, that’s not like me, but, how shall I say, I don’t know, restored to myself, I never left myself, free . So I doubtless did better, at least no worse, not to stir from my observation post .
 I understand now why I never wore a flower in my buttonhole, though it was large enough to hold a whole nosegay . My buttonhole was set aside for my hat . But it is neither of my hat nor of my greatcoat that I hope to speak at present, it would be premature'
 There is a little of everything, apparently, in nature, and freaks are common . And I, what was I doing there, and why come? These are things that we shall try and discover .
 I sleep little and that little by day. Let me hear nothing of the moon, in my night there is no moon, and if it happens that I speak of the stars it is by mistake . How agreeable it is to be confirmed, after a more or less long period of vacillation, in one’s first impres- s
 "I know how to summon these rags to cover my shame. I wonder what that means. But I shall not always be in need" A and C I never saw again. But perhaps I shall see them again.
 I was crippled though I was, I was no mean cyclist, at that period. I fastened my crutches to the cross-bar, one on either side. I propped the foot of my stiff leg on the projecting front axle. It was a chainless bicycle, with a free-wheel, if such a bicycle exists .
 When I had to part from my bicycle I took off the horn and kept it about me . I believe I have it still, somewhere, and if I blow it no more it is because it has gone dumb . Even motor-cars have no horns nowadays .
 The author's mother never refused to see him . She never called him son, fortunately, he couldn't have borne it .
 I called her Mag because for me, without my knowing' why the letter g abolished the syllable Ma . And at the same time I satisfied a deep and doubtless unacknowledged need, the need to have a Ma, Dan was my father’s name perhaps, yes, perhaps she took me for my father .
 One knock meant yes, two no, three I don't know, four money, five goodbye . I was hard put to ram this code into her ruined and frantic under-standing, but I did it .
 'I don’t think too harshly of her. She must have thought I was saying no to her all the time, whereas nothing was further from my purpose'
 I forgive her for having jostled me a little in the first months . And I*also give her credit for not having done it again, thanks to me . If ever I'm reduced to looking for a meaning to my life, you never can tell, it's in that old mess I'll stick my nose to begin with .
 Samuel Beckett was distraught, who am so seldom distraught, from what should* I be distraught, and as to my motions even more uncertain than usual . The night must have tired me, and the sun, hoisting itself higher and higher in the east, had poisoned me, while I slept .
 Cyclists entering and leaving town are required by the police to dismount, cars to go into bottom gear and horse- drawn vehicles to slow down to a walk . The ways into and, of course, out of this town are narrow and darkened by enormous vaults .
 I was told that my way of resting, my attitude when at rest astride my bicycle, my arms on the handlebars, my head on my arms, was a violation of I don’t know what, public order, public decency . Modestly, I pointed to my crutches and ventured one or two noises regarding my
 The wisest perhaps, lying in the squares or sitting on their doorsteps, were savouring its languid ending, forgetful of recent cares . Others on the contrary were using it to hatch their plans, their heads in their hands .
 Samuel BBCKETT was interrogated by a police official at a police station . The official had a straw hat on his head and protruding from his mouth was a thin flexible object . He was dismissed before he knew what had happened .
 I am full of fear, I have gone in fear all my life, in fear of blows . Insults, abuse, these I can easily bear, but I could never get used to blows . Even spits still pain me. But they have only to be a little gentle, I mean refrain from hitting me, and I seldom fail to
 Molloy was told by the sergeant that he could not sit on his crutches because of his short leg . He said: 'They let me keep my hat on, I don't know why. Is it your mother's name?'
 Molloy, I cried, my mother’s name . Your mother, said the sergeant, is your mother . Your name must be Molly too, I said .
 Social workers will pursue you to the ends of the earth, the vomitory in their hands . The Salvation Army is no better than the Salvation Army . To him who has nothing it is forbidden not to relish filth .
 Conscious of my wrongs, I was surprised to find myself so soon at freedom once again . I will not tell what followed, for I am weary of this place, I want to go more .
 I used to be intelligent and quick. I had it to overflowing, the exasperated good-will of the over-anxious . So that my repertory of permitted attitudes has never ceased to grow. I have only been told what good behaviour is and I am well-behaved, within the limits of my physical possi-b
 If I have always behaved like a pig, the fault lies not with me but with my superiors, he writes . He says he had only negative and empirical notions, which means that he was in the dark, most of the time .
 Samuel Beckett was imprisoned in a barracks in China . He was released after a year and a half in prison . Beckett says he has always cried out more or less openly .
 Molloy writes in the present tense, it is the mythological present, don’t mind it . It is difficult to think riding, for me .
 The MOLLOY 27 is a book of short stories written by the author . It is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99 .
 It came back to my mind, from nowhere, as a moment before my name, that I had set out to see my mother, at the begin- ning of this ending day . My reasons? I had forgotten them. But I knew them, I must have known them, and I had only to find them again .
 28 SAMUEL BECKETT is published by Simon Cowell at the end of this week at the bottom of a ditch . The novel is about the life of a young man .
 "I wish I smelt like a sheep, or a buck-goat," writes the author . "I don't smell like a Sheep, I wish I Smelt Like a Sheep"
 A shepherd and his dog were walking along the path . The shepherd asked the dog where they were going . The dog did not reply .
 I heard the shepherd whistle, and I saw him flourishing his crook, and the dog bustling about the herd, which but for him would no doubt have fallen into the canal . The bleating grew faint because the sheep were less anxious., or because they were further away, or because my hearing was worse than a moment before .
 The Aegean, 'thirsting for heat and light, him I killed, he killed himself, early on, in me' The pale gloom of rainy days was better fitted to my taste, no’s not it, to my humour, no . I had-neither taste nor humour, I lost them early on .
 In winter, under his greatcoat, I wrapped myself in swathes of newspaper, and did not shed them until the earth awoke, for good, in April . One day I counted them. Three hundred and fifteen farts in nine- teen hours .
 All roads were right for me, a wrong road was an event, for me . I did not know if I was on one of those right roads and that disturbed me . Judge then of my relief when I saw, ahead of me, the familiar ramparts loom .
 "I had been living so far from words so long, you understand, that it was enough for me to see my town" "Even my sense of identity was wrapped in a namelessness often hard to penetrate, as we have just seen I think"
 "All I know is what the words know, and the dead things, and that makes a handsome little sum, with a beginning, a middle and an end"
 "I have never been particularly resolute, I mean given to resolutions, but rather inclined to plunge headlong, into the shit," he writes . The most you can hope is to be a little less, in the end, the creature you were in the beginning, and the middle . Precautions are like resolutions, to be taken with precaution
 MOLLOY 33 was overtaken by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and all ages . But instead of grovelling in my turn, invoking my great age and infirmities, I made things worse by trying to run away .
 The police constable brought down heavily on his handle-bars his big red hairy paw, I noticed it myself, and had it appears with the lady the following conversation . But it is clear he has not all his wits about him, that he is beside himself, for reasons of which we know nothing .
 Samuel Beckett needed to help his mother get rid of her dog, and I needed her . "I too needed her, it seemed. She must have told me, for that was an insinuation I could not decently pass over"
 I always say either too much or too little, which is a terrible thing for a man with a passion for truth like mine . I mean that on reflection, in the long run rather, my verbal profusion turned out to be penury .
 The dog was uniformly yellow, a mongrel I suppose, or a pedigree, I can never tell the difference . His death must have hurt him less than my fall me .
 It was she dug the hole, under a tree, because I couldn’t, though I was the gentleman, because of my leg . I could have dug with a trowel, but not with a spade . I had so to speak only one leg at my disposal, I was virtually one- legged .
 All my life I have gone in terror of festered wounds, I who never festered, I was so acid . My life, my life, now I speak of it as of something over, now as of a joke which still goes on, and it is neither .
 Loussc dug the hole while I held the dog in my arms . He was heavy already and cold, but he had not yet begun to stink . He smelt bad, if you like, but bad like an old dog, not like a dead dog .
 The dog had ticks in his ears, I have an eye for such things, they were buried with him . Funny she should have chosen, to bury her dog beneath, the only tree I can identify .
 She ushered me into the drawing-room and gave me food and drink, good things without a doubt . Unfortunately I didn't much care for good things to eat . But I quite liked getting drunk .
 "I woke up in a bed, in my skin. They had carried their impertinence to the point of washing me" "I went to the door. Locked. To the window. Barred. What is there left to try?" "The chimney perhaps" He listened, his head on one side, pondered, then said
 The room was chock-full of pouffes and easy chairs, they thronged all about me, in the gloom . My beard was missing, when I felt for it with anguished hand . How had my sleep withstood such liberties?
 "I was a little closer to her than the night before, if my reckoning was accurate. But was it? If I was in the right town, I had made progress. If on the other hand I was  in the wrong town, from which my mother would necessarily be absent, then I had lost ground"
 In the end it was magic that had the honour of my ruins, and still today, when I walk there, I find its vestiges . How difficult it is to speak of the moon and not lose one’s head, the witless moon . The next pain in the balls was anthropology and the other disciplines, such as psychiatry
 'If I do not go there gladly, I go perhaps more gladly there than anywhere else, astonished and at peace' 'I listen and the voice is of a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world'
 "I too am at an end, when I am there, my eyes close, my sufferings cease and I end" "I wither as the living can not. I will listen no longer, for the time being, to that"
 The moon which had just sailed gallant and full past my window had appeared the night before . The moon filled me suddenly with amaze, with surprise, perhaps better . I was considering it, after my fashion, with indifference, seeing it again, in a way, in my head, when a great fright came suddenly upon me .
 42 SAMUEL BECKETT asks: Had there then elapsed, between that night on the mountain, that night when I saw A and C and then made up my mind to go and see my mother, and this other night, more time than I had thought, namely 14 full days, or nearly? And if so, what had
 The moon seen from Lousse’s house, far from being full, as it had appeared to me, was in fact merely entering on its first quarter . And it came back also to my mind, as sleep stole over it again, that my nights were moonless and the moon foreign .
 "I vanish happy in that alien light, which must have once been mine, then the anguish of return, I won't say where, I can't, to absence perhaps, you must return"
 I pushed them rather than struck them, I thrust at them and lunged, and that is not pushing either, but it’s more like pushing than striking . But recalling who I was I soon threw away my crutch and came to a standstill in the middle of the room .
 He was an oriental perhaps, a vague oriental, a child of the Rising Sun . He wore white trousers, a white shirt and a yellow waistcoat, like a 44 SAMUEL BECKETT .
 The boughs them- selves seemed to shift, as though endowed with an orbital velocity of their own . In the big frosted window the door was no longer inscribed, but had slightly shifted to the right, or to the left . But that there were natural causes to all these things I am willing to concede .
 My sucking-stone in particular was no longer there. I deemed it wiser to say nothing about it, all the more so as he would have been capable, after an hour’s argument, of fetching me a com- pletely unsuckable stone . Nothing was missing then except the lace to fasten my hat to my
 A knife was missing, a noble knife, and I soon received a very fine vegetable knife, so-called stainless, but it didn’t take me long to stain it . Perhaps they had been taken from me at the police-station, without my knowing it, or scattered and lost, when I fell, or at some other time
 'I no longer know what I»am doing, nor why, those are things I understand less and less, I don’t deny it' 'If I do not always appear to observe this principle it is because it escapes me from time to time, and vanishes' 'And then how can you know whether you are observing it
 What I have, what I am, is enough, was always enough for me, and as far as my dear little sweet little future is concerned I have no qualms, I have a good time coming . And the things that are worth while you do not bother about, you let them be .
 Lousse was in the garden, fussing around the grave . She was sowing grass on it, as if grass wouldn’t have sown itself on it . Seeing me, she came warmly towards me and gave me food and drink .
 "I would live in her home, as though it were my own. I would have plenty to eat and drink, to smoke too if I smoked, and my remaining days would glide away without a care"
 SAMUEL BECKETT met Lousse in a garden in a town in the south of France . Lousse loved spike- lavender above all other herbs and flowers, because of its smell, and then also of its spikes, and its colour .
 She gathered this lavender when it bloomed I presume, left it to dry and then made it up into lavender-bags that she put in her cupboards to perfume her handkerkerchiefs, her underclothing and house-linen . And all the time she never stopped talking, whereas I only opened my mouth to ask
 There was no question of moon, nor any other light, but it was a night of listening, a night given to the faint soughing MOLLOY 49 . And these inseparable fools I indulged turn about, that they might understand their foolishness .
 'I was the precarious calm, the thaw of the snows which make no differ- ence and all the horrors of it all over again. But that did not happen to me often, mostly I stayed in my jar which knew neither seasons nor gardens'
 The words engraved themselves for ever on my memory, perhaps because V understood them at once, a thing I didn’t often do . Not that I was hard of hearing, for I had quite a sensitive ear, and sounds were registered perhaps better by me than by most .
 I mis- judged the distance separating me from the other world, and often I stretched out my hand for what was far beyond my reach . I would have been an excellent husband, incapable of wearying of my wife and committing adultery only from absent- absent-minded .
 A good while then with Lousse. It’s vague, a good while, a few months perhaps, a year perhaps . That is to say I could I suppose, if I took the trouble. But why should I? In order to establish beyond all question that I could not do otherwise?
 The house and garden were fixed, thanks to some unknown mechanism of com- pensation . When I moved, from place to place, it was very slowly, as in a cage out of time . To be out of one and not out of the other was for cleverer than me .
 'I helped neither in the house nor the garden and knew nothing of what work was going forward, day and night, nothing save the sounds that came to me' 'I preferred the garden to the house, to judge by the long hours I spent there'
 The garden was surrounded with a high wall, its top bristling with broken glass like fins . The wall was broken by a wicket-gate giving free access to the road . Never did I see a woman within these precincts, and by precincts I do not merely mean the precincts .
 Lousse her- self I saw but little, she seldom showed herself to me, out of tact perhaps, fearing to alarm me . But I think she spied on me a great deal, hiding behind bushes, or the curtains .
 'I accuse her without ill-feeling of having drugged my food and drink with noxious and insipid powders and potions' 'Even sipid they would have made no difference, I would have swallowed it all down with same whole-heartedness'
 SAMUEL BECKETT usually attributed to heavy eaters eat ponderously and with method . But the little he did eat I devoured with a voracity . He would engulf five or six mugs of beer with one swig then drink nothing for a week .
 From time to time I caught myself making a little bound in the air, two or three feet off the ground at least . And it happened too, less surprisingly, when I was walking, or even propped up against some- thing, that I suddenly collapsed, like a puppet when its strings are dropped .
 I never had to call for it. It was brought to me, wherever I happened to be, on a tray . It was round, with a low rim, to keep things from falling off . But this basket made no impression on me, good or bad, and I could not tell .
 With Lousse my health got no worse, or scarcely . By which I mean that what was already wrong with me got worse and worse, little by little . But there was kind'ed no new seat of suffering or infection .
 Lousse was a woman of extraor- dinary flatness, physically speaking of course . She had a somewhat hairy face, or am I imagining it, in the in- terests of the narrative? The poor woman, I saw her so little, so little looked at her. And was not her voice suspiciously deep?
 She had a hole between her legs, oh not the bunghole I had always imagined, but a slit, and in this I put, or rather she put, my so-called virile member, not without difficulty . It was she made me acquainted with love, for she had told me so .
 Lumbago: Have I never known true love, after all? Perhaps after all she put me in her rectum .
 Edith gave me money after each session, to me who would have consented to probe it to the bottom . She had a dainty flat, it made you want to lie down in a corner and never get up again .
 When your frantic member casts about for a rubbing-place, and the unction of a little mucous membrane, and meeting with none does not beat in retreat, but re-tains its tumefaction . And when you add a little pedicure and massage, having nothing to do with the instant of bliss strictly speaking, then I add
 It is quite possible that the fact of having found a man when they should have found a woman was immediately repressed and forgotten, by the few unfortunate enough to know about it . But there is one thing that tor- ments me, when I delve into all this, and that is to know whether all my life has been devoid of love
 My mother's image sometimes mingles with theirs, which is literally unendurable, like being crucified . And I am quite willing to go on thinking of her as an old woman, widowed and withered, and of Ruth as another .
 She sat down on her dog's grave, perhaps, which was mine too in a way, and which by the way she had not sown with grass, as I had thought . I left her my bicycle which I had taken a dislike to, suspecting it to be the vehicle of some malignant agency and perhaps the cause of my recent
 Not knowing where I was nor consequently what way I ought to go I went with the wind . I entered the first shelter I came to and stayed there till dawn, for I knew I was bound to be stopped by the first policeman and asked what I was doing .
 Little windows overlooked it, on either side, on every floor, facing one another . At the end there were two recesses opposite each other, littered with miscellaneous rubbish and with excrements, of dogs and masters .
 A fine rain was falling and I took off my hat to give my skull the benefit of it, my skull all cracked and furrowed and on fire, on fire . But I also took it off because it was digging into my neck, because of the thrust of the wall .
 Samuel Beckett's diary is written when he is in pain . Beckett writes that his legs are as stiff as a life-sentence .
 In the end I left the im- passe, where half-standing, half-lying I may have had a little sleep, my little morning sleep, and I set off, believe it or not, towards the sun . Or rather towards the least gloomy quarter of the heaven .
 Molloy met a young old man shivering all alone in a narrow doorway . Many a one must have said. They arc right, I am wrong, meaning by they the category to which he did not belong . So I went and stood beside him, with the air, I hoped, of one jvho says .
 There I am then in my turn alone, in the doorway, in a doorway . I could not hope for anyone to come and stand beside me, and yet it was a possibility I did not exclude . That’s a fairly good caricature of my state of mind at that instant, I stayed where I was .
 Samuel BECKBTT could never bring himself to sell it, even in his worst need, for he could never understand what possible purpose it could serve . For a certain time I think it inspired me with a kind of veneration, for there was no doubt in my mind that it was not an object of virtue, but that The strange instrument
 There is rapture, or there should be, in the motion crutches give . It is a series of little flights, skimming the ground . The mind cannot always brood on the same cares and the mind needs fresh cares .
 Molloy lost interest in knowing, among other things, what town he was in and if he should soon find my mother and settle the matter between us . For it was no small matter and I was bent on it .
 "I came' to the ramparts as night was fall- ing, having described a good quarter of a circle, through bad navi- gation" Things are perhaps dif- ferent today .
 Molloy says he never noticed anything of the kind, but however far he went, it was al- ways the same sky, always the same earth .
 "When I see my hands, on the sheet, which they love to floccillate already, they arc not mine, less than ever mine, I have no arms, they are a couple, they play with the sheet" "With my feet it’s the same, sometimes, when I see them at the foot of the
 From eight or nine till noon is the dan- gerous time, but towards noon things quiet down . The most im- placable are sated, they go home, it might have been better but they've done a good job .
 The author spent the night in the desert before setting out on his journey . He describes the night as 'nauseating but not pestilent, less rat than toad' Day is the time for lynching, for sleep is sacred and especially the morning .
 For the monster on the move, or on the watch, lurking in his lair, there is no mercy . For the hunter is weak at heart and senti- mental, overflowing with repressed treasures of gentleness and com- passion .
 Much of my life has ebbed away before this shivering expanse, to the sound of the waves in storm and calm, and the claws of the surf . 'I found it natural not to rush into it and, when I forgot myself to the point of trying, to stop in time'
 I once went forth on it, in a sort of oarless skiff, but I paddled with an old bit of driftwood . And I sometimes wonder if I ever came back, from that voyage . For I have always said. First learn to walk, then you can take swimming lessons .
 "I shuffled them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while I sucked, before transferring them" "I was really only sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about"
 70 SAMUEL BECKETT replaced the stones by the four in the right pocket of his trousers . He then replaced the four remaining stones in the left pocket with the four from the right .
 No matter how I caused the stones to cir- culate, I always ran the same risk . It was obvious that by increasing the number of my pockets I was bound to increase my chances of enjoying my stones in the way I planned .
 T did not feel inclined to take all that trouble for a half-measure . And if at a pinch I could double the number of my pockets, were it only by dividing each pocket in two, with the help of a few safety-pins .
 One day suddenly it dawned on the former, dimly, that I might perhaps achieve my purpose without increasing the number of my pockets, but simply by sacrificing the principle of trim . The meaning of this illumination began to sing within me, like a verse of Isaiah, or of Jeremiah, I did not penetrate at once .
 All (all!) that was necessary was to put for example, to begin with, six stones in the right pocket of my great- 72 SAMUEL BECKETT coat, or supply-pocket . Five in the left pocket of his greatcoat, which for the time being remained empty .
 Watch me closely.-I take a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, suck it, stop sucking it, put it in the left pocket, the one empty (of stones) I take a second stone from. the right pockets of my trousers, suck them, put them in left pocket. And so on until the. right pocket
 The MOLLOY 73 series of sucks and transfers starts with the first six stones back in the supply pocket, the next five in the right pocket of my stinking old trousers and the last five in left pocket of same .
 First, seventh and twelfth for example of the first cycle might very well be the sixth, eleventh and sixteenth respec- tively of the second . If in the cycles taken together utter confusion was bound to reign, at least within each cycle taken separately .
 The only perfect solution would have been the sixteen pockets, sym- metrically disposed, each one with its stone . But however imperfect my own solution was, I was pleased at having found it all alone .
 'I suck the stones in the way I have described, not haphazard, but with method, was also I think a bodily need' 'Deep down I didn’t give a tinker’s curse about being off my balance'
 The black speck I was, in the great pale stretch of sand, who could wish it harm? Some came near, to see what it was. But when they saw the jetsam was alive, decently if wretchedly clothed .
 'My good eye saw more clearly and there were even days when the bad one too had to look away' 'To be taken unawares was so to speak impossible, for I turned often towards the land too'
 Samuel Beckett lived in a cave in the middle of a swamp between his town and the sea . There was always talk of draining, by means of canals, or of transforming into a vast port and docks, or into a city on piles for the workers .
 The statistics escape me for the moment and doubtless always will, so complete is my indifferer- ence to this aspect of the question . It is true they actually began to work and that work is still going on in certain areas . But from this to pro- claiming that the sea came lapping at the ramparts of my town,
 The two legs shorten at the same time, but when one shortens, and the other not, then you begin to be worried . 'I didn’t know which foot to land on, when I came down'
 For the old pain, do you follow me, I had got used to it. Whereas to the new pain, though of the same family exactly, I hadn't yet had time to adjust myself . Nor should it be forgotten that having one bad leg plus another more or less good,
 "I could have made it seem as short as the other, long enough to land on the true short one, before taking off again. But I couldn’t. Bend it. For how could I bend it, when it was stiff?"
 The author was on crutches for most of his life due to a broken leg . He says the pain of his leg at rest was constant and monoto- nous . But the pain inflicted by work was suspended for an instant .
 "I could count the days when I could neither breathe in the blessed air with its life-giving oxygen nor, when I had breathed it in, breathe out the bloody stuff, I could have counted" "The thought of suicide had little hold on me, I don’t know why, I thought 1 did, but I see I
 "I was tempted to put an end to it, by cutting my throat, but I never succumbed . The noise betrayed me, I turned purple" "Not a word, not a word against the crises that seized me, wr wr
 "I apologise for having to revert to this lewd orifice, 'tis my muse will have it so. Perhaps it is less to be thought of as the eyesore here called by its name *han as the symbol of those passed over in silence"
 At the seaside they had developed normally, yes, I had noticed nothing abnormal . But I had hardly left the shore, harried by the dread of waking one fine day, far from my mother, with my two legs as stiff as my crutches .
 My health which, if it was not exactly rude, to the extent of my bursting with it, was at bottom of an incredible robustness . No, my true weak points were else- where. cramp. And if I do not draw up here and now the impressive list of them it is because I shall never draw it up, perhaps
 "My prepuce, sat verbum, oozes urine, day and night, at least I think it’s urine, it smells of kidney . Me too they would bury alive, in despair, if there was any justice in the world . So I husband my strength, for the spurt .
 "I can’t shake off the feeling that the day will come for me to say what is left of all I had" "I must first wait, to be sure there is nothing more I can acquire, or lose, or throw away, o- give away"
 I was no ordin- ary cripple, far from it, and there were days when my legs were the best part of me . The fact is, and I deplore it, but it is too late now to do anything about it, that I have laid too much stress on my legs .
 Some days I advanced no more than thirty or forty paces, I give you my oath . The forest was all about me and the boughs, twining together at a prodigious height, compared to mine .
 Bui came on a kind of crossroads, you know, a star, or circus, of the kind to be found in even the most unexplored of forests . I might have loved him, I think, if I had been seventy years younger, but it's not certain .
 Samuel Beckett met a stranger in the forest . He asked him to show him the way to the nearest town . He did not know . He held him back by the sleeve when he made to go .
 "I swung, that’s all that matters, in an ever-widening arc, until I decided the moment had come and launched myself forward with all my strength" I carefully chose the most favourable position, a few paces from the body, with my back of course turned to it .
 People imagine, because you are old, poor, crippled, terrified, that you can’t stand up for yourself, and generally speak- ing that is so . But given favourable conditions, a feeble and awk- 85 ward assailant, in your own class what, and a lonely place, and you have a good chance of showing what
 When a man in a forest thinks he is going forward in a straight line, in reality he is . going in a circle . And by going on doing this, day after day, and night after night, I looked forward to getting out of the forest, some day . For I stopped being half-witted and became sly, whenever I
 "I could have stayed there till I died, unrepining, yes, without pining for the light and the plain" "I considered that the forest was no worse then. And it was not only no worse, to my mind, but it w£s better, in this sense, that I was there"
 "I could not, stay in the forest I mean, I was n5t free to. That is to say I could have, physically nothing could have been easier, but I was not purely physical, I lacked something" "But imperatives are a little different, and I have always been inclined to submit to them, I don�
 Molloy 87: The voice which deserted me was partly to blame, that's all it can be reproached with . For the outer world opposed my suc- ceeding too, with its wiles, he has given some examples .
 All my life, I think I had been going to my mother, with the purpose of establishing our relations on a less precarious footing . When I was with her, and I often succeeded, I left her without having done anything . And when I was no longer with her I was again on my way to her, hoping to do better the next
 SAMUEL BECKETT: "I am merely complying with the convention that demands you either lie or hold your peace" "I did not say. Yet a little while, at the rate things are going, etc., but that resembled perhaps what I would have said, if I had been able"
 "I had no impression of any kind, but simply somewhere something had changed, so that I too had to change" "My marches got shorter and shorter and my halts more and more frequent and I may add prolonged"
 It was winter, it must have been winter, and not only many trees had lost their leaves, but these lost leaves had gone all black and spongy and my crutches sank into them . Strange to say I felt no colder than usual. But I was never very sensitive to changes of temperature .
 A horn goes well with the forest, you expect it. But a gong! Even a tom-tom, at a pinch, would not have shocked me . It was mortify- ing to have been looking forward to the celebrated murmurs if to nothing else .
 The advantage of this mode of loco- motion compared to others, I mean those I have tried, is this, that when you want to rest you stop and rest, without further ado . For standing there is no rest, nor sitting either, but he who moves in this way, crawling on his belly, like a reptile, no
 I kept losing my hat, the lace had broken long ago, until in a fit of temper I banged it down on my skull with such violence I couldn’t get it off again . But there was always present to my mind, which was still working, if laboriously, the need to turn, to keep on turning .
 I suppose it v/as the fall into the ditch that opened my eyes, for why would they have opened otherwise? I looked at the plain rolling away as far as the eye could see . I fancied I saw, faintly outlined against the horizon, the towers and steeples of a town .
 It must have been spring, a morning in spring. I thought I heard birds, skylarks perhaps . I suppose you have to try everything once, succour included, to get a complete picture of the resources of their planet .
 Moran was savour- ing the day of rest, while deploring the importance attached to it, in certain parishes . To work, even to play on Sunday was not of necessity reprehensible, in his opinion . Moran, Moran, Jacques. That is the name I am known by .
 Seeing something done which I could tthve done better myself, if I had wished, was a joy in which, during the week, I could seldom indulge . The writer would gladly have rested on weekdays too, if he could have afforded it .
 Samuel Beckett was not a neighbor but had journeyed from afar on purpose to disturb me . He was dressed in his heavy, sombre Sunday best, and at this my displeasure knew no bounds .
 Gaber's son was spying on them from behind a bush . Gaber called him and ordered him to fetch some beer . He returned with two glasses and a quart bottle of beer .
 Jacques went away grumb- ling with his finger in his mouth, a detestable and unhygienic habit, but preferable, all things considered, to that of the finger in the nose .
 Moran cried, but he’s out of his mind! Your son goes with you, said Gaber . Moran asked for a private communion, in the course of the afternoon, in which he would go withoi.; lunch . Moran was too late for mass .
 I was sometimes inclined to go too far when I reprimanded my son, who was con- sequently a little afraid of me . Oh I had not been spoiled either, merely neglected .
 Anything in the nature of surveillance was hateful to the good Father Ambrose . The verger had a list of the faithful and that, from his place beside the font, he ticked us off when it came to the absolution .
 Moran had not yet begun to take the matter seriously . Instead of bringing to bear upon it without delay all the resources of my mind and of my experience, I sat dreaming of my breed’s infirmities .
 The eucharist produced the same effect, taken on top of beer, however light? I could always try. I decided to suck a few peppermints on the way to the presbytery .
 Gaber had gone without his beer, yet he had wanted it badly . He said he had been to church alone . Gaber was a free-thinker. He knew my habits, my Sunday habits .
 I felt a great confusion coming over me. Should I set out on my autocycle? This was the question with which I began. I liked punctuality, all those whom my roof sheltered had to like it too. Sometimes too I left on foot, or on my bicycle, silently, in the night .
 I liked leaving on my autocycle, I was partial to this way of getting about . To try and solve the problem of transport under such conditions was madness . I was wrong, the sky was clouding over, soon it would rain .
 My son burst in wanting to know if he might go out. Where? Out! Vagueness I abhor. To the Elms, he replied. And yet there is not an elm to be seen in it . I would almost have preferred him to say For a walk or to look at the tarts .
 The Father is sleeping, said the servant. I hastened on to the presbytery. She showed me into the sitting-room, bare and bleak, dreadful, dreadful . Father Ambrose came in rubbing his eyes. He offered me a cigar which I accepted .
 I came to ask you a favour, I said, a wink is as good as a nod, you want communion . Sunday for me without the Body and Blood is like — . Above all no profane comparisons, he said. Perhaps he was thinking of the kiss without a moustache or beef without mustard .
 Father Ambrose sent for a portable pyx, opened it, and dispatched me . He informed me that Mrs Clement, the chemist’s wife, had fallen, in her laboratory, from the top of a ladder, and broken the neck .
 Samuel Beckett's hen has been sitting with her arse in the dust, from morning to night . She ate nothing any more, he cried. He meditated. Like Job, haha, he said. What a joy it is to laugh, from time to time .
 The interview with Father Ambrose left me with a painful impression . He was still the same dear man, and yet not nobility . I seemed to have surprised, on his face, a lack of nobility .
 My life was running out, I knew not through what breach. I might have known. I could not understand what was happening to me. I tried to pull myself together. I even rummaged in the bin. Nothing. them.
 My son had a way of saying papa, when he wanted to hurt me, that was very special . His face took on an expression of anguished attention . We leave this evening, I said in substance, on a journey . Put in your little knapsack, the one I gave you for your birthday, your toilet things,
 I have an appointment with Mr 104 SAMUEL BECKETT Py tomorrow . There exist other dentists, I said, Mr Py is not the unique dentist of the northern hemisphere . We are not going into the wilderness. But he’s a very good dentist .
 My son had drawn a small glass from his pocket and was examining the inside of his mouth, prising away his upper lip with his finger . He was not worthy of me, not in the same class at all, I could not escape this conclusion .
 I rang for Martha and lay down again. She looked at me in astonishment. Did we not always dine at home? I had not yet told her we were leaving. I had made the mistake of putting myself in her place .
 The Eisner sisters were not bad neighbours, as neigh- bours go . They made a little too much music, that was the only fault I cr ild find with them . If there is one thing gets on my nerves it is music .
 Crouching down I would stroke his ears, through the railings, and utter wheedling words . He reared up on his hind legs and pressed his chest against the bars . Then I could see his little- black penis ending in a thin wisp of wetted hair .
 Molloy used a code incomprehensible to all but himself . Gaber understood nothing about the messages he carried . His memory was so bad that his messages had no existence in his head, but only in his notebook .
 Gaber reflected on his messages and drew conclusions from them, it was not as we would hdVe reflected on them, you and I, the book closed and probably the eyes too, but little by little as he read . Gaber was undecipherable to all but one- self, dead without knowing it to the meaning of one
 Samuel Beckett was a member of a secret organisation . He says he and Gaber thought they were the only ones of their kind . But he says they were not .
 Martha was sitting in her rocking-chair, in the chimney-corner, rocking herself moodily . This rocking chair, she would have you believe, was the only possession to which she clung .
 Molly's weekly supply of lager, half-a-dozen quart bottles, was delivered every Saturday . Of these six bottles Gaber and I, together, had emptied one . There should therefore be five left, plus the remains of a bottle from the previous week . I never touched them until the next day, for lager must be left
 The author's son was looking at his stamps in his album of duplicates . He was in the habit of gloating over certain rare and valuable stamps which he could not bring himself to leave, even for a few days .
 Samuel Beckett's mother took the albums and withdrew, without a word . The sight went straight to my heart, but nevertheless I did my duty . Anger should be left to cool, in my opinion, crisis to pass, before one operates .
 Sollst entbehren, that was the lesson I desired to impress upon him, while he was still young and tender . Magic words which I had never dreamt, until my fifteenth year, could be coupled together .
 After dinner I drowse, I took off my coat and shoes, opened my trousers and got in between the sheets . It is in the warmth, in the gloom, that I best pierce the outer turmoil's veil .
 The blood drains from my head, the noise of things bursting, merging, avoiding one another, assails me on all sides, my eyes search in vain for two things alike . I drown in the spray of phe- nomena .
 Molloy, or Mollose, was no stranger to me. If I had had colleagues, I might have suspected I had spoken of him to them . But I had no colleagues and knew nothing of the circumstances in which I had learnt of his existence . Perhaps I had invented him, I mean found him ready-made in my head
 Molloy was not completely foreign to me either, it seemed . But she was much less alive than her son, who God knows was far from being so . After all perhaps I knew nothing of mother Molloys, or Mollose, save in so far as such a son might bear .
 Mol, very clear, followed almost at once by a second, very thick, as though gobbled by the first . Mol, or oc. Mol, was doubtless that my mind had a weakness for this ending, whereas the others left it cold .
 He swayed, to and fro, like a bear. He rolled his head, uttering incomprehensible words . He was massive and hulking, to the point of misshapenness. And, without being black, of a dark colour .
 "I was unable to conceive what had brought him to such a pass, I was no better able to conceive how, left to his own resources, he could put an end to it . A natural end seemed unlikely to me, I don’t know why, but then my own natural end, would it not at the same time be
 Molloy was not the true denizen of my dark places, for it was not his hour . But images of this kind the will cannot revive without doing them violence . Don’t wait to be hunted to hide, that was always my motto .
 "There were three, no, four Molloys that inhabited me, my caricature of same, Gaber's and the man of flesh and blood somewhere awaiting me"
 The sound of a gong, struck with violence, filled the house . It seemed as if the enquiry were about to start at last . But would not this fifth Molloy necessarily coincide with the fourth?
 Anger led me sometimes to slight excesses of language, I could not regret them . It seemed to me that all language was an excess of language . Naturally I con- fessed them to Martha and laughed so much I began to hiccup .
 The sequel, I said. Not only had the rain stopped, that I knew already, but in the west scarves of fine red sheen were mount- ing in the sky . I felt them rather than saw them, through my little wood .
 SAMUEL BECKBTT's son said he had not told Martha we were leaving . He pretended not to know what I was talking about . He was wrong to invoke the pic. dish. But he was still young .
 I was not averse, in conversation with my son, to jests of doubtful taste, in the interests of his education . But I had turned my phrase badly, mouth was not the word I should have used .
 Since your dinner is uneatable, I said, be good enough to prepare a packet of sandwiches, with the chicken you couldn't finish . My son came back at last at last with a minute-thermometer .
 Father Ambrose gave his son an enema, with salt water, but he struggled, but not for long . The porcelain, the mirrors, the chromium, instilled a great peace within me .
 How can you hope to shit, i said, when you’ve nothing in your stomach? He protested he had had his lunch . He stood up trembling all over .
 I rubbed the iodex into my knee. The knee is full of little loose bones. Let it soak well in, said my son . Martha watched me in silence, lolling in her rocking chair .
 She asked me how long I expected to be away. I have no idea, I said. I advised her to have a good rest while I was away . Then almost in the same breath, seeing her so old, worse than old, ageing, so sad and solitary in her ever- lasting corner .
 Martha had been a long time in my service. I was often away from home. Sometimes I departed without a word to her. I reproached myself with this negligence. I dissolved a sleeping-pow- der in the milk.
 Samuel Beckett was so concerned that he took his son's favourite stamps . The Togo one mark carm! 10 with the pretty boat, the Nyassa 1901 ten reis, and several others were found .
 I had not struggled, toiled, suffered, made good, lived like a Hottentot. I desired this advantage for my son. And that he should hold aloof from those who pride themselves on their eagle gaze. I tip- toed out. I quite enjoyed playing my parts through to the bitter end.
 There is something in this house tying my hands. A man like me cannot forget, in his evasions, what it is he evades . I reflected with bitter satisfaction that if my son lay down and died by the wayside, it would be none of my doing .
 My son’s window was faintly lit. He liked sleeping with a night-light beside him . I sometimes felt it was wrong of me to let him humour this weakness . Others concerned the dog Zulu, the perfumes Sharpened tenfold by the rain .
 In a house without a gas-oven I would not have felt easy . In the night, interrupting my prowl, I like to go up to a window, lit or unlit, and look into the room, to see what is going on . I have terrified more than one neighbour in this way .
 Moran made ready to go without knowing where he was going, having consulted neither map nor time-table . Moran had only the vaguest notion of the outfit he would need, the time the expedition was likely to take, the money he would require and the nature of the work to be done .
 Conspicuousness is the A B C of my profession . To call forth feelings of pity and indulgence is indispensable . All I needed was a butterfly-net to have vaguely the air of a country schoolmaster on convalescent leave .
 There is something about a father that discourages derision . When he is seen out with his young hopeful, his face grows longer and longer . He is taken for a widower .
 Some people whistle for no reason at all, not I. Not I. dreaded. And if I whistled fitfully while revolving these lugubrious thoughts, it was because I was happy at heart to leave them .
 A massive chain, attached to my braces, prevents me from losing them . This chain lies, coiled, on the bunch, in my pocket . Its weight gives me a list to the right, when I am tired, or when I forget to counteract it .
 This disgust- ing exhibition left me no choice but to use my umbrella, holding it by the end with both hands . 'Shame on you, I cried, you ill-bred little pig! I would get angry if I were not careful'
 SAMUEL BECKETT's son was crying when he left his room . He was still young, the words of reproach died on my lips . The night was fine, in his humble opinion .
 My trees, my bushes, my flower-beds, my tiny lawns, I used to think I loved them . If I sometimes cut a branch, a flower, it was solely for their good . And I never did it without a pang. I grew no vegetables .
 I had long since given up going for walks with my son, though I sometimes longed to do so . The least outing with him was torture, he lost his way so easily . I wanted him to walk like his father, with rapid steps, his head up, breathing even and economical .
 With me he invariably took the wrong turn, a crossing or a simple corner was all he needed to stray from the right road . I waited for him to come back, then spoke the words calculated to settle this matter once and for all . Get behind me, I said, and keep behind me .
 I toyed briefly with the idea of attaching him to me by means of a long rope . We should have needed, not the soft silent rope, but a chain, which was not to be dreamt of . And yet I did dream of it, for an instant I amused myself dreaming of it .
 I tell you to keep behind me and you go before me, I said . But already I was called elsewhere by the image of my son no longer behind me, but before me . His school cap was green with initials and a boar's head, or a deer’s, in gold braid on the front .
 There he was before me, his big feet splayed, his knees sag- ging, his stomach sticking out, his chest sunk, his chin in the air, his mouth open, in the attitude of a veritable half-wit . I myself must have looked as if only the support of my umbrella and the wicket were keeping me
 My son was a veriest dunce when it came to literature and the so-called exact sciences . He had no equal for the dates of battles, revolutions, restorations and other exploits of the human race . He deserved his scout-knife .
 He would doubtless at that moment with pleasure have cut my throat, with that selfsame knife I was putting so placidly in my pocket . But he was still a little on the young side, my son, for the great deeds of vengeance . He kept back his tears, for which I was obliged to him .
 I have no intention of relating the adventures which befell us, me and my son, together and singly, before we came to the Molloy country . It would be tedious, in this relation that is forced upon me, but I shall conduct it in my own way, up to a point .
 "I follow it none the less, more or less, I follow it in this sense, that I know what it means," he writes . "And I feel I shall follow it from this day forth, no matter what it commands"
 Molloy Y 133 is a novel about the life of a young man in England . The novel was written by the author of the novel .
 "I know scarcely any better where I am going and what awaits me than the night I ".lung to the wicket, beside my idiot of a son, in the lane"
 Samuel Beckett was born and raised in Molloy, Ireland . He lived in a small market-town called Bally in the north of the country .
 Ballybaba means Bally and Ballyba when you mean Bally plus its domains . The principal beauty of this region was a kind of strangled creek . The people came flocking from the town, unromantic people, to admire this spectacle .
 The population of Ballyba was small. The land did not lend itself to cultiva- tion. The pastures, in spite of the torrential rains, were exceedingly meagre and strewn with boulders . Only quitchweed grew in abundance, and bitter blue grass fatal to cows and horses .
 I showed my son how to use his pocket-compass . He was behaving well, better than I had hoped . We walked for several days, by sequestered ways . I did not want to be seen on the highways .
 A farmer I knew overtook my son and took him away in the direc- tion we were coming from . The right thing would have been to travel by night and hide during the day . But the weather was so fine I could not bring myself to do it . Such a thing had never happened to me before, in the course of my
 The Yerk affair took me nearly three months to conclude successfully . I felt he must have told me what to do with Molloy once he was found .
 On another occasion my mission consisted in bringing the per- son to a certain place at a certain time . A most delicate affair, for the person concerned was not a woman . I regret it. I was never required to prove I had suc- ceeded, my word was enough .
 SAMUEL BECKETT never saw one of them again, subsequently, not a single one . The directions which Gabcr must have given me with reference to this had gone clean out of my head . I don’t know what became of him. I lost interest in my patients, once I had finished with them .
 I had his address just as he had mine. I would send him a telegram. How deal with M? To give me an explicit reply, though in terms if necessary veiled, was not beyond his powers. But was there a telegraph in Ballyba? I also told myself, being only human, that the longer I took to
 The sensation could indeed well be compared to that of a blow, such as I fancy a horse’s hoof might give . I waited anxiously for it to recur, motionless and hardly breathing, and sweat- ing . But sure enough the pain did recur a few minutes later, but not so bad as the first time
 It's easy to talk about being unable, whereas in reality nothing is more difficult . I despaired at first ever bending my leg again and then, through sheer determination, did succeed in bending it, slightly .
 The pain, having warned me several times in vain, had no more to say . I examined the bad knee in the light of my torch . It was neither red nor swollen. It felt like a' clitoris . All this time my son was puffing like a grampus .
 When you can neither stand nor sit with comfort, you take refuge in the horizontal, like a child in its mother’s lap . You explore it as never before and find it possessed of unsuspected delights . And if in spite of all you come to tire of it in the end, you have only to stand up, or indeed
 The sky sinks in the morning, this fact has been in- sufficiently observed . Unless it is the earth that lifts itself up, to be approved, before it sets out sinking .
 SAMUEL BECKETT told him to go to Hole, he said, and buy a bicycle . I asked him if he was pleased. He did not look pleased. What a restful change it is from time to time, a little dialogue, I said .
 He took them out of his pockets one by one, held them delicately between finger and thumb, turned them this way and that before my eyes . I told him to stop . Perhaps he was hiding the ten shillings up his sleeve, or in his mouth . Besides I was not ill. I should have had to get up and search
 Did I know how much I had spent? No. Usually I kept the most rigorous accounts when away on business . This time no. For I was throwing my money away with as little concern as if I had been travelling for pleasure . Do you imagine a second-hand bicycle costs four pounds ten?
 I didn’t tell you second-hand, I Said, I told youSecond-hand for preference . He osten- tatiously let fall a big ball of tangled string . The ten shillings were perhaps inside it .
 Jacques Moran sent his son to buy a bicycle in Hole, the nearest town in Turdy . He had not yet grasped that the bicycle was for him .
 When he asked me how I was I said noth- ing, and when no one asked him anything he announced he was not feeling well . Are you not pleased, I said, to have a nice brand-new bicycle, all your own? I was decidedly set on hearing him say he was pleased . But I regretted my phrase, it
 I reached up above my head, broke off a live bough and hurled it violently in his direction . He stopped and stared at me, his head on one side like a parrot, utterly bewildered apparently . Foolishly, I made to stoop, to pick up a stone or piece of wood or a clod, and nearly fell
 The day seemed very long. I missed my son! I busied myself as best I could. I ate several times. I took advantage of being alone at last, with no other witness than God, to masturbate. My son must have had the same idea. I hope he enjoyed it more than I did.
 After ten or eleven steps a great weariness seized hold of my leg, a heaviness rather, and I had to stop . I took a little morphine. I asked myself certain questions. Why had I not told my son to bring me back something for my leg?
 I saw a man a few paces off, standing motionless in a shelter . He wore a coat much too heavy for the time of the year . He turned and we looked at each other for some time in silence . There was a coldness in his stare, and a thrust, the like of which I never saw .
 His accent was that of a foreigner or of one who had lost the habit of speech . I expected him to devour it there and then. But he broke it in two and put the pieces in his coat-pockets .
 I wished I could have been in the middle of a desert, under the midday sun, to look after him till he was only a dot, on the edge of the horizon . He threw me a last look and went. It was almost dark. He walked with swift uncertain step, often changing his course .
 The 148 SAMUEL BECKETT knee was not better, but it was no worse either . Moran's leg was perhaps a little worse, without my being in a condition to realize it, for the simple reason .
 "I found that when I leaned upon it the heaviness in my leg, due probably to a defect in the bloodstream, disappeared even more quickly than when I stood supported only by my muscles and the tree life" "I no longer confined myself to circling about the shelter, as I had done the previous day, but I radiated from it
 "What I saw was more like a crumbling, a frenzied collapsing of all that had always protected me from all I was condemned to be. again" "I seemed to see myself ageing as swiftly as a day-fly"
 I saw a little globe swaying up slowly from the depths, through the quiet water . Then little by little a face, with holes for the eyes and mouth and other wounds, and nothing to show if it was a man’s face or a woman’
 Samuel Beckett was stranded in the middle of the English countryside when he was hailed by a man on his way home from work . He had been unable to find a way back to the UK and was running out of food . He was trying to renew his provisions when he heard the voice of a man outside .
 The branch was thick and full of sap and did not burn when I stuck it in the fire . I numbered among my familiars the dragon-tree of Teneriffe that perished at the age of five thousand years, struck by lightning .
 Molloy 151 was precisely the kind of pest I thought he was, without being sure, because of the dark . He wore a thick navy-blue suit (double-breasted) of hideous cut and a pair of out- rageously wide black shoes . The fringed extremities of a dark muffler, seven feet long at
 The old man asked me if I had seen an old man with a stick pass by . He wanted to know if I'd seen him pass by and described him . But the face which he said vaguely resembled his own was nothing compared to the face .
 Samuel Beckett found his friend stretched on the ground, his head in a pulp . He dragged him by the ankles and dragged him backwards into the shelter .
 "I dragged him into the copse, with frequent rests on the way, but without letting go his legs, so as not to have to stoop again to pick them up" "I dismantled the shelter and threw the branches over the body" "In a word I struck"
 MOLLO Y 153 found keys scattered on the ground, the ring having broken . "I wiped each key on the grass, before putting it in my pocket, whether it needed wiping"
 While looking in this way for my keys I found an ear which I threw into the copse . There is no use my counting them, for I do not know how many there were . But finally I said. Hell to it. I’ll do with those I have .
 The land from where I was, and even the clouds in the sky, were so disposed as to lead the eyes gently to the camp, as in a painting by an old master . I made myself as comfortable as possible. I got rid of my various burdens and I ate a whole tin of sardines and one apple .
 To kill time I asked myself a certain number of questions and tried to answer them again . And I also mended the ring, twisting the two pieces together, and I slipped on the keys and made fast the long chain again .
 I declare the foregoing to have been written with a firm and even satisfied hand, and a mind calmer than it has been for a long time . For I shall be far away, before these lines are read, in a place where no one will dream of coming to look for me . And then Youdi will take care of me, he
 Samuel Beckett met a man on his way to the camp where the camp had been . He was pushing a bicycle which he let fall with a gesture signifying he could bear no more . Pick it up, I said, till I look at it. He picked it up and said he had a fall .
 They asked four pounds five, he said . Have you the receipt? I said. He did not know what a receipt was. I cried. If he had said two pounds or even thirty shillings I should have cried .
 The dirty little twister was letting the air escape between the valve and the con- nection which he had purposely not screwed tight . He took a bar of chocolate from his pocket and offered it to me . But instead of eating it, as I longed to, I cast it from me .
 My son and I were on a bike ride when the back wheel buckled and we fell . My stocking was torn and my leg bleeding. Happily it was the sick leg. What would I have done, with both legs out of action?
 Samuel Beckett's son straddled the frame of his bicycle . He followed, half dragged, half hopping. I trembled for my testicles .
 I would not have got there without my son. He often complained of his health, his stomach, his teeth . When I asked him what was wrong he could not tell me. I still did not know what I was to do with Molloy . In this way we came to Ballyba. happily .
 A flock of black shorn sheep strayed about them, unafraid . They did not seem timid, as sheep go . The shepherd watched me as I came, without getting up . The silence was absolute .
 I longed to say. Take me with you, I will serve you faithfully, just for a place to lie and a little me . But when I moved I saw nothing but the ground and the play of my feet .
 He raised one hand, it wavered an instant as if over a map, then stiffened . The pipe still smoked faintly, the smoke hung blue in the air an instant, then vanished . The sheep were losing interest in 160 SAMUEL BECKETT .
 I was wondering how to depart without self-loathing or sadness, or with as little as possible, when a kind of immense sigh all round me announced it was not I who was departing, but the flock . I watched the man in front, then the sheep, huddled together, their heads sunk, jostling .
 I must have had so many scenes with my son. At the time it must have seemed a scene like any other, that’s all I know . But the next day I realised my mistake. For waking early I found myself alone, in the shelter .
 I desired him to learn double-entry book-keeping and had instructed him in its rudiments . I could no longer be bothered with these wretched trifles which had once been my delight . I had told him to keep an eye out, on his expeditions, for a second bicycle .
 SAMUEL BECKETT. found his son had gone through his pockets before he left, while I slept . He left him with his bag, umbrella and fifteen shillings . He was alone, with my bag, my umbrella (which he might easily have taken too)
 "I dallied with the hopes that spring eternal, childish hopes, as for example that my son, his anger spent, would have pity on me and come back to me! Or that Molloy, whose country this was, would come to me, and grow to be a friend, and help me do what I had to do
 At the thought of the punishments Youdi might inflict upon me I was seized by such a mighty fit of laughter that I shook, with mighty silent laughter . For several days I had eaten nothing. I could probably have found blackberries and mushrooms, but I had no wish for them .
 Moran found Gaber sitting on a tree-stump, half asleep and half asleep . Moran found him dressed as when he had last seen him .
 He took a small electric torch from his pocket and shone it on his page . He read Moran, Jacques, home, instanter. He put out his torch, closed his notebook his finger and looked at me . Do you recognise me? I cried. Ah Moran, he said, what a
 Gaber kept rubbing his hands from morning to night, I can hear them in the outer room, said Gaber . Moran, he said, you are beginning to give me a serious pain in the arse . Gaber said, 'I'll be going, if that's all you have to say to me' Moran overtook him,
 Gaber gave me a shove. He had not intended to make me fall, he did41ot realise the state I was in, he had only wanted to push me away . I did not try to get up. I let out a roar. He bent over me. He was not brutal, Gaber,* I knew him well.
 Samuel Beckett set out on a quest to walk from Ballyba to Dublin . Each day saw him advance a little further and he stopped when he could go no further .
 Anyone else would have lain down in the snow, firmly re- solved never to rise again, not I . I still think I am cleverer than things. There are men and there are things, to hell with animals. And with God. them .
 The disease, whatever it was, was dormant! How can such things be? But to return to the flies, I like to think of those that hatch out at the beginning of winter, within doors, and die shortly after . That is a strange race of flies .
 Certain questions of a theological nature preoccupied me strangely . What value is to be attached to the theory that Eve sprang, not from Adam’s rib, but from a tumour in the fat of his leg (arse?) Does the serpent crawl or, as Comestor affirms, walk upright?
 Is it true that the devils do not feel the pains of hell? What was God doing with himself before the creation? Might not the beatific vision become a source of boredom in the long run? What is one to think of the excommunication of vermin in the sixteenth century?
 What was the name of the martyr who, being in prison, celebrated the consecration on his stomach and gave himself absolution? Would I go to heaven? Would we all meet again in heaven one day? What had become of my hens, my bees?
 The dance was best to be observed among the bees re- turning to the hive, laden more or less with nectar, and it involved a great variety of figures and rhythms . These evolutions I finally interpreted as a system of signals by means of which the incoming bees informed the out- going bees in what direction to go .
 The purpose of the hum 'is not to emphasise the dance, but on the contrary to vary it,' says 170 SAMUEL BECKETT .
 'I would never do my bees the wrong I had done my God,' he writes . 'I have spoken of a voice giving me orders, or rather advice'
 This belly I did not know remained my belly, my old belly, thanks to intuition . "I not only knew who I was, but I had a sharper and clearer sense of my identity than ever before"
 At the sight of the blue flesh, between the knicker-bockers and the tops of my boots, I sometimes thought of my son and the blow I had fetched him . My shirt? Never! But I often wore it inside out and back to front .
 When it rained, when it snowed, then I found myself faced with the following dilemma . Was I to go on leaning on my umbrella and get drenched or was I to stop and take shelter under my open umbrella? It was a false dilemma, as so many dilemmas are. I could have gone on, very slowly,
 When it was clear that the rain, etc., would not stop all day, or all night, then I did the sensible thing and built myself a proper shelter . But I did not like proper shelters, made of boughs, any more . For soon there were no more leaves, but only the needles of certain conifers .
 Molloy spent two. boughs. preferring the shelter of my faithful umbrella . I reached home with my fifteen shillings intact .
 He seized me by the jacket, by the lapel. In the other he held a spade. To bury me with if necessary. I understood finally that I did not own the land. It was his land. What was I doing on his land?
 It’s thanks to her I lost my infant boy, I said, and kept his mamma . Such sentiments could not fail to please a cattle breeder'
 Moran took a florin from his pocket and gave it to him for your poor-box . It's a long way, he said. God will go with you, I said. But I cannot, I cannot . I have sworn to make a bee-line to her ! Moran took himself off telling me to stay where I was .
 The key went into the hole, but would not turn . Long disuse? A new lock? I burst it open. I drew back to the other side of the lane and hurled myself at it. I had come home, as Youdi had com- manded me .
 This time a year ago I was setting out. One day I received a visit from Gaber. He wanted the report. Perhaps I shall meet Molloy. My knee is no better. It is no worse either. The company had cat off the light. They have offered to let me have it back. But I told them they could
 I have been a man long enough, I shall not put up with it any more . I am going to blow it out and go into the garden. I shall go faster, all will go faster. They will be happy days. I have crutches now .
 At first I did not know what it wanted. But in the end I understood this language. I understood it, I understand it, all wrong perhaps . Does this mean I am freer now than I was? I do not know. I shall learn .
 L was always content, knowing I would be. 180 SAMUEL BECKETT: I must be on my guard against throes. I am less given to them now, since coming here .
 "I wish them all an atrocious life and then the fires and ice of hell and in the execrable generations to come an honoured name" There he is now, my old debtor. Shall I then fali on his neck? I shall not answer any more questions. I shtdl even try not to ask myself any more.
 From now on I shall never do anything any more from now on but play. But perhaps I shall not succeed any better than hitherto. Perhaps as hitherto I shall find myself abandoned, in the dark, without anything to play with. Then 1 shall play with myself. Then it will be different. I shall play a great part of the time,
 One about a man, another about a woman, a third about a thing and finally one about an animal, a bird prob- ably" "I think that is everything. Perhaps 1 shall put the man and the woman in the same story, there is so little difference between a man and a woman"
 Samuel Beckett will write a book about his possessions . He will start with his stories of a man and a woman . Then he will write about a stone . But reason has not much hold on me, just now .
 "It is playtime now. I find it hard to get used to that idea. The old fog calls" "I shall play with all the more ardour afterwards. And it will be a pendant to the inventory"
 This room seems to be mine. I can find no other explanation to my being left in it. Unless it be at the behest of one of the powers that be. That is hardly likely. Why should the powers have changed in their attitude towards me?
 Samuel Beckett fainting in an ambulance has left no trace on his mind . He does not remember how he got to the hospital . But who has not experienced such lapses?
 If I did not feel myself dying, I could well believe myself dead, expiating my sins, or in heaven's mansions . But I feel at last that the sands are running out. The loss of consciousness for me was never any great loss .
 There is a cupboard I have never looked into. My possessions are in a corner, in a little heap. With my long stick I can rummage in them, draw them to me, send them back. When I have completed my inventory, if my death is not ready for me then, I shall write my memoirs .
 The moon has grown familiar, I am well familiar with her changes of aspect and orbit . I know more or less the hours of the night when I may look for her in the sky and the nights when she will not come . And all sorts of birds come and perch on the window-sill, asking for food!
 I am naked in the bed, in the blankets, whose number I increase and diminish as the seasons come and go . I am never hot, never cold. I don't wash, but I don’t get dirty. If I get dirty somewhere I rub the part with my finger wet with spittle. What matters is to eat and
 I don't know how long I have been here, I must have said so . All I know is that I was very old already before I found myself here . I call myself an octogenarian, but I cannot prove it . Perhaps I am only a quinquagenarian, or a quadragen- arian .
 "My body is what is called, unadvisedly perhaps, impotent. There is virtually nothing it can do" "I tremble a little, but only a little" "Sometimes I miss not being able to crawl around any more"
 The man's name is Saposcat. Like his father’s . Like his Christian name? I don’t know. He will not need one. His friends call him Sapo .
 Mr. Saposcat used to say to his wife, I really must find work for the evenings and the Saturday after- noon. He added, faintly, And the Sunday. But if you do any more work you’ll fall ill. The life of the Saposcats was full of axioms .
 The Saposcats drew strength to live from the prospect of their impotence . But sometimes, before reaching that stage, they paused to consider the case of their first-born . It was in this atmosphere of unbridled dream that these conferences usually ended .
 Saposcat took over the erroneous figure, murmuring it over and over to himself as though it were a question of the rise in price of some indispensable commodity, such as butcher's meat . Sometimes he stated wearily his regret that his son should not be more eager to make himself useful .
 They did not know why he was committed to a liberal profession . He will look after us when we are old, said Mrs Saposcat. wife .
 Samuel Beckett wrote a book about his life . The book is called 'Sapo' and is published by Simon & Schuster . It is about a young man's life .
 At the age of 14 he was a plump rosy boy . His wrists and ankles were thick, which made his mother say that one day he would be even bigger than his father . But Sapo was not expelled, either then or later .
 Even his teachers could not help thinking he had a remarkable head . But he could not endure the look in Sapo’s eyes and went out of his way not to meet it .
 Samuel Beckett was a simpleton, but he loved the flight of the hawk . He would stand rapt, gazing at the long pernings, the quivering poise, the wings lifted for the plummet drdp .
 Sapo's phlegm, his silent ways, were not of a nature to please . Sapo remained motionless in his place, often standing, and gazed straight before him . To old dogs the hour comes when, whistled by their master setting forth with his stick, they cannot spring 'after him'
 Mr. Sapo dropped his jaw and breathed through his mouth . His father supposed him a prey to the first flutterings of sex . His dream was less of girls than of himself, his own life .
 Mr Saposcat was sorry he had not learnt the art of thinking, beginning by folding back the second and third fingers the better to put the index on the subject and the little finger on the verb . And a little less well endowed with strength and courage he too would have abandoned and despaired .
 Adrian Beckett was a patient, reasonable child, avid of the least gleam, a stranger to the joys of darkness . Here truly is the air I needed, a lively tenuous air, far from the nourishing murk that is killing me .
 In the morning he took private lessons. In the afternoon he left the house, with his books under his arm, on the pretext that he worked better in the open air, no, without a word . I fell asleep. Coma is for the living .
 Sapo was born grave as others syphilitic. All alone, well hidden, played the clown, all alone, hour after hour . Sapo stands on one leg, motionless, his strange eyes closed . The turmoil of the day freezes in a thousand absurd postures .
 "I tried to live without knowing what I was trying, perhaps I have lived after all, without knowing . Ah yes, to relieve the tedium. Live and cause to live"
 Samuel Beckett wrote of his experiences in a letter to a friend . He wrote that he was on the point of vanishing, at the same time as the stranger .
 "I want, when the great day comes, to be in a position to enounce clearly, without addition or omission, all that its interminable prelude had brought me and left me" I have rummaged a little in my things, sorting them out and drawing them over to me, to look at them . I was not
 A boot, for example, can a boot roll behind a piece of furniture? And yet I see only one boot . I see then I had attributed to myself certain objects no longer in my possession, as far as I can see .
 SAMUEL BECKETT writes about his time in India and his time is limited . He also dis-covered a little packet tied up in age-yellowed newspaper .
 My situation is truly delicate. What fine things, what momentous things, I am going to miss through fear, fear of falling back into the old error . All I ask is that the last of mine, as long as it lasts, should have living for its theme .
 Kaspar David Friedrich loved a tempestuous and bright night . Words and images run riot in my head, pursuing, flying, clashing, merging, endlessly . Beyond this tumult there is a great calm, and a great indifference .
 "I am buried in the world, I knew I would find my place there one day, the old world cloisters me, victorious . But I am not wise. For the wise thing now would be to let go, at this instant of happiness . And what do I do? I go back again to the light"
 The Lamberts found it difficult to live, I mean to make ends meet . There was the man, the woman and two children, a boy and a girl . The father was known as Big Lambert, and big he was indeed .
 He often spoke of his father with respect and tender- ness . His like will not be seen again, he used to say, once I am gone . For his fee was lower than the butcher's, and he had even been known to demand no more, in return for his services, than a lump of gammon or a pig's
 Lambert could speak of nothing but the pig he had just dispatched, 1 would say into the other world if I was not aware that pigs have none but this, to the great affliction of his family . But they did not dare protest, for they feared him . Lambert was feared and in a position to do as he pleased .
 Lambert's farm was in a hollow, flooded in winter and in summer burnt to a cinder . Lambert's son, or heir, was a great strapping lad»with terrible teeth .
 'Dead world, airless, waterless. That’s it, reminisce. Here and there, in the bed of a crater, the shadow of a withered lichen'
 The 4 voman, pausing an instant between two tasks, or in the midst of one, flung up her arms and, in the same breath, let them fall again . Then she began to toss them about in a way difficult to describe, and not easy to understand . The movements resembled those, at once frantic and slack, of an
 Sapo remained alone, by the window, the bowl of goat’s milk on the table before him, forgotten . The room was dark in spite of the door and window open on the great outer light .
 The ticking of the invisible alarm clock was as the voice of that silence . Sometimes abruptly he turned to face it, letting it envelop and pervade him, with a kind of relief . Then he heard more clearly the sounds of those at work, the daughter calling to her goats, the father cursing his mule .
 It was quite possible there were several grey hens, and yet only one in the habit of coming to the kitchen . Sometimes she was followed by a second, a third and even a fourth, bearing no likeness to her .
 Sapo spent long hours in that old kitchen where, neither quite indoors nor quite out of doors, he waited to be on his feet again . Among those who must have known, some arc dead and the others have forgotten .
 The Lamberts saw Sapo, from far off or from near by, suddenly emerge from behind the washing and set off down the path . Then they did not try to detain him or even call goodbye, unresentful at his leaving them . They knew he meant no harm .
 They cried the news to one another, for they often worked at a great distance apart, or they exchanged signals, all erect and turned towards the event, for it was one . And at the first spell of rest taken in common, about the table or elsewhere, each one gJIve his version of what had passed and listened to those
 "The face of Sapo as he stumbled away was as always grave, or rather expressionless," he writes . "When he halted it was not the better to think, or the closer to pore upon his dream, but simply because the voice had ceased"
 The sound I liked best had nothing noble about it. It was the barking of the dogs, at night, in the clusters of hovels up in the hills . The dogs of the valley replied with their gross bay all fangs and jaws and foam . From the hills another joy came down, the brief scattered lights that sprang up .
 "For a long time now I have been hearing things confusedly," he writes . "The noises of nature, of mankind and even my own, were all jumbled together in one and the same un- bridled gibberish"
 SAMUEL BECKETT writes about himself with the same pencil and in the same exercise-book as about about about himself . He has a minimum of memory is indispensable, if one is to live really .
 It is because it is no longer I, I must have said so long ago, but another whose life is just beginning . That is my excuse. But there must be others, no less excellent . It is right that he too should have his little chronicle, his memories, his reason .
 It has been singing the same song for a long time now . It has uttered for the last time the triumphal cry on which [t] ends .
 This last phrase seems familiar, suddenly I seem to have written it somewhere before, or spoken it, word for word . Turned towards the window I saw the pane shiver at last, before the ghastly sunrise .
 From now on I shall write on both sides of the page . SAMUEL BECKETT at all events .
 The decisive moment was at hand when the hopes reposed in Sapo were to be fulfilled . "I gave rein to my pains, my impotence"
 Mr. Saposcat sold himself a fountain-pen, at a dis- count. year . He cried, as she made to take it in her hand .
 A bird, its yellow beak agape to show it was singing, adorned the lid, which Mr Saposcat now put on again . He wrapped with expert hands the box in tissue-paper and slipped over it a narrow rubber band .
 Sapo arrived at the farm earlier than usual . He was surprised to see, at a distance, the father’s big red and white head . His bodj- was in the hole or pit he had dug for his mule which had died .
 Big Lambert sat by the window, smoking, drinking, watching his son Sapo . Sapo sat down before him, laid his hand on the table and his head on his hand . Edmund paused to rest, leaned panting on the spade and smiled .
 Edmund stopped often to rest, leaning on the spade and looking about him . The look in his eye, he said, was like a jrayer to me to take him . It was covered with sores, but in the case of mules one should never let oneself be deterred .
 Edmund and his mother passed each other by in silence . The face of the earth, on which it had plodded its life away, would see it no more . Edmund would soon be able to plough and harrow the place where it lay .
 Seeing Sapo she first thought he was her daughter . She emptied out the lentils on the table and began to sort them . But suddenly with a furious gesture she swept the two together .
 To stop in the middle of a tedious and perhaps futile task was some- thing Sapo could readily understand . For a great number of tasks arc of this kind, without a doubt, and the only way to end them is to abandon them .
 Lambert's son Sapo, attracted by the savoury smell, entered the kitchen . After a silence Lambert declared. I’ll kill Whitey tpmorrow. Those of course were not the words he used, but thai was the Thai .
 Edmund went up to bed, so as to masturbate in peace and comfort before his sister joined him, for they shared the same room . But neither his wife nor his son could approve him .
 Lambert, the only member of the household who had no desire to sleep with anybody, saw it coming with indiffer- ence . Lambert sat watch- ing her . She was crouched before the range, in an attitude of dejection .
 Mrs. Lambert was alone in the kitchen . She sat down by the window and turned down the wick of the lamp . She stood a moment irresolute, bowed forward with her hands on the table .
 Five years now it had been going on, five or six, not more . Night seemed less night in the kitchen pervaded with the everyday tribulations . Her mind was a press of formless questions, mingl- ing and crumbling limply away .
 The author was once in love with a parrot . He tried to teach it to say 'Nihil in intellects etc. agree' One day I took counsel of an Israelite on the subject of conation .
 Bawling babies are what dumbfound me now. Suave mari magno, especially for the old salt . When young the old filled me with wonder and awe. The house is full of them finally .
 All hangs together, I am in chains. Unfortunately I do not know quite what floor I am on, perhaps I am only on the mezzanine . All I- know is that the living are there, above me and beneath me .
 SAMUEL BECKETT: I honestly believe that in this house there are people coming and going and »even conversing, and multitudes of fine babies . There is naturally another possibility that does not escape me, though it would be a great disappointment to have it confirmed, and that is that I am dead already .
 "My horse-sense tells me I have not yet quite ceased to gasp" "I enjoy a kind of night and day, admittedly, often it is pitch dark, but in rather a different way from the way to which I fancy I was accustomed"
 The light, instead of being the dawn, turned out in a very short time to be the dusk . And the sun, rather of rising higher and higher in the sky as I confidently expected, calmly set, and night calmly fell again .
 There is really no colour in this place, except in so far as this kind of grey incandescence may be called a colour . I myself am very grey, I even sometimes have the feeling that I emit grey, in the same way as my sheets for example .
 There is no possibility of my making light, artificial 222 S AMU EL BECKETT light, like the couple across the way . The noises too, cries, steps, doors, murmurs, cease for whole days, their days .
 Sometimes it seems to me I am in a head and that these eight, no, six, these six planes that enclose me arc of solid bone . A kind of air circulates, I must have iaid so, and when all goes still 1 hear it beating against the walls and being beaten back by them .
 What mv stick lacks is a little prehensile proboscis like the nocturnal tapir’s. I should really lose my pencil more often, it might do me good, I might be more cheerful. I have spent two un- forgettable days of which nothing will ever be known .
 "I use the two points turn and turn about, sucking them frequently, I love to suck" "I strip them with my nails which are long, yellow, sharp and brittle for want of chalk or phosphate" "The day is fast approaching when nothing will remain but a fragment too tiny to hold"
 All these superficies or should I say in- fraficies, the horizontal as well as the perpendicular, had visibly blanched since my last examination of them, dating from I know 224 SAMUEL BECKBTT not when . And this is all the more singular as the tendency of things in general is I believe rather
 I can even distinctly remember the paper- hangings or wall-paper still clinging in places to the walls and covered with a writhing mass of roses, violets and other flowers . But now they seem to be all gone, quite gone, and if there were no flowers on the ceiling there was no doubt something else, cupids perhaps
 1 MALONE DIES 225 was utterly deceived, I mean in imagining I had grasped the true nature of my absurd tribulations, but not so utterly as to feel the need to reproach myself . For I knew it would be so, even as I said .
 "I have felt so many strange things, so many baseless things assuredly, that they are perhaps better left unsaid. To speak for example of the times when I go liquid and become like mud, what good would that do?"
 SAMUEL BECKETT has the brainwave to live long enough to get acquainted with free carbonic gas, then say thanks for the nice time and go . That has always been my dream at bottom . Perhaps it is the same one back again, ideas are so alike, when you get to know them .
 "I was never happy, but wishing night would never end and morning never come" "I shall go on doing as I have always done, not knowing what it is I do, nor who I am, nor where I am"
 I have taken a long time to find him again, but I have found him . How did I know it was he, I don't know. I ran him down in the heart of the town, sitt ; ng on a bench . And what can have changed him so? Life perhaps, the struggle to love, to eat, to
 'I was always a great man for apples, to be had almost for the whinging if you knew your way about, and a little sunshine and shelter for those who direly needed them' There he is as good as gold on the bench, his back to the river, and dressed as follows .
 The tails of this coat literally sweep the ground and rustle like a train, when he walks . The thread of the sleeves too is bare and frayed into long waving strands that flutter in the wind . The posture is completely lacking in abandon, and but for the absence of bonds you might think he was bo^nd to the bench .
 The coat, when new, was of a fine plain green colour, what you might call cab green . But perhaps l am wrong to call this coat a greatcoat and perhaps I should rather call it an overcoat or even cover-me-down .
 The material of this coat looks like felt, and the various dints and bulges inflicted upon it by the spasms and contortions of the body subsist long after the fit is past . The hat, as hard as iron, is marred by a wide crack or rent extending .
 It would not surprise me to learn that this hat once belonged to a sporting gentleman . And it is a pleasure to find oneself again in the presence of one of those immutable relations between harmoniously perishing terms .
 Macmann might be stark staring naked under this surtout for all anyone would be any the wiser . The trouble is he does not stir. Since morning he has been here and now it is evening . The tugs, the black funnels striped with red, tow to their moorings .
 At this hour then erotic craving accounts for the majority of couples . But these arc few compared to solitaries pressing forward through the throng, obstructing the access to places of amusement .
 Some even take a cab to get more quickly to the rendezvous or, when the fun is over, home or to the hotel . Then the drowsiness, the little memorandum book with its little special pencil, the yawned goodbyes . Then you see the last stage of the horse, between its recent career as a pet horse or
 The 232 SAMUEL BECKETT place is 232 Samuel BECKett place, by the shortest route or deviously . Each one has his reasons, while wondering from time to time what they are worth .
 For Macmann it is a true spring evening, an equinoctial gale howls along the quays bordered by high red houses, many of which are warehouses . Or it is per- haps an evening yi autumn and these leaves whirling in the air .
 In order not to die you must come and go. Unless you happen to have someone who brings you food . And you can remain MALONE DIES 233 for two, three and even four days without stirring hand or foot .
 There is no point, no point in not knowing this or that, either you know all or you know nothing, and Macmann knows nothing . But it is bad policy, for on the fifth day rise you must, and rise in fact you do, but with how much greater pains than if you had made up your mind to it the day
 Samuel Beckett's eyes stare into the fulness of the great deep and its unchanging calm . At long intervals they close, with gentle suddenness of flesh that tightens, often without anger, and closes on itself .
 'I feel I feel it's coming. I mean sure of feeling that my hour is at hand. For I never doubted it would come'
 "I believe I have now reached what is called the month of May, for May comes from Maia, hell, I remember that too, goddess of increase and plenty" At hand, that is in two or three days, in the language of the days .
 I don't feel my feet any more, my feet feel nothing any more . And yet I feel they arc beyond the range of the most powerful telescope . Is that what is known as having a foot in the grave?
 I do not expect to see my sex again, with my naked eye, not that I wish to, we’ve stared at each other long enough, in the eye, but it gives you some idea . If my arse suddenly started to shit at the present moment, which God forbid, I firmly believe the lumps would fall out
 Samuel Beckett has written 236 books . He is currently living in a small apartment in New York City . He says he fits in the room as well as he can .
 "I simply believe I can say nothing that is not true, I mean that has not happened, it’s not the same thing but no matter," Bob says . "If I ever stop talking it will be because there is nothing more to be said," he says .
 In two or three days MALONE DIES 237 if I remember rightly . Then it will be all over with the Murphys, Merciers, Molloys, Morans and Malones, unless it goes on be- yond the grave .
 "It is time for this to stop. After all this window is whatever I want it to be, up to a point" "I should like to find a hole in the wall behind which so much goes on"
 "What strikes me to begin with is how much rounder it is than it was" First I sec the night, which surprises me, to my surprise, I suppose because I want to be surprised, just once moje. yourself . Suddenly the window across the wav lights up, or suddenly I realize it is lit up .
 "I might have found nothing better to speed me from this place thait the nocturnal sky where nothing happens, though it is full of tumult and violence"
 There are three of them, and how it sways and totters, but rather poor in colour . Perhaps they are cold, that they rub against each other so, for friction maintains heat and brings it back when it is gone .
 Caught by the rain far from shelter Macmann stopped and lay down . He fancied that the nape of the neck and the back right down to the loins were more vulnerable than the chest and belly .
 It was sometime in the after- noon, impossible to say more, for hours past it had been the same leaden light . Incommoded by the rain pouring into his hat through the crack, Macmann took it off and laid it on his temple . His hands at the ends of the long out- stretched arms clutched .
 Rain pelted down on his back with the sound first of a drum, but in a short time of washing, as when washing is soused gurgling and squelching in a tub . He distinguished clearly and with interest the difference in noise of the rain falling on him and falling on the earth .
 'He could not see as his true sin, but as yet another atonement which had miscarried and plunged him in it deeper than before' 'And it was often in fear and trembling that he suffered, saying, 'This will cost me dear'
 Macmann would have been more than human, after forty or forty-five minutes of sanguine expectation, if he had nof begun to reproach himself with what he had done, namely with having lain down on the ground instead of continuing on his course .
 Macmann's link with his species was through fiis ascendants only, who were all dead . But the better late than never thanks to which true men, true links, can acknowledge the error of their ways and hasten on to the next .
 When lying on your stomach in a wild and practically illimitable part of the country, you turn over on your back, then there is a sideways movement of the whole body, including the head . But when you are in a narrow bed, I mean one just wide enough to contain you, a pallet shall we say, then it is
 In the midst of his suffering, for one does not remain so long in such a position with- out being incommoded, he began to wish that the rain would never cease nor consequently his sufferings or pain, for the cause of his pain was almost certainly the rain .
 People are never content to suffer, but they must have heat and cold, rain and its contrary which is fine weather, and with that love, friendship, black skin and sexual and peptic deficiency . For the rain could cease without his ceasing to suffer .
 SAMUEL BECKETT was more reptile than bird and could suffer mutilation and survive . He sat and lay down at the least pretext and only rose again when the £lan vital or struggle for life began to prod him in the arse again .
 No one ever came to his help, to help him avoid the thorns and snares that attend the steps of innocence . He could never count on any other craft than his own, any other strength, to go from morning to evening and then from evening to morning without mortal hurt .
 He could no longer distinguish plants destined for the embellishment of the home or the nutrition of man and beast from weeds which are said to serve no useful purpose, but must have their usefulness too, for the earth to favour them so .
 At the end of the day, throughout the sector consigned to him, one could see the peels of oranges and bananas, cigarette-butts, cigarettes and scraps of paper, dogs’ and horses’ excrement .
 Samuel Beckett had to do a great part of his life's work with his bare hands . He had to, he had to . had to if he wished to go on coming and going on the earth .
 Mac- mann was incapable of picking his steps and choosing where to put down his feet . Even had he been so he would have been so to no great purpose, so little was he master of his movements .
 The rain ttill falling with unabated violence in spite of his having turned over on his back, Macmann grew rest- less . It is perhaps not inappropriate to wish Macmann, since wishing costs nothing .
 Macmann rolled upon the ground without ulterior motive . He assumed that one of his extremities was heavier than the other, but not by much . As he rolled he began to dream of a flat land where he would never have to rise again .
 Samuel Beckett's latest book, 248, is published by Simon & Schuster . The book is based on Becket's experiences in Spain .
 It is with me in the bed, under the blankets, there was a time I used to rub myself against it, saying. It’s a little woman. But it is so long that it sticks out under the pillow and finishes far behind me. Round the shank, between the two corks, a wisp of black thread
 There it was, in the grass, thrown away because it could no longer serve, the stem having broken off (I suddenly remember that) just short of the bowl . Perhaps I thought it pretty, or felt for it that foul feeling of pity I have so often felt in the presence of things, especially little portable things in wood and stone,
 I loved to finger and caress the hard shapely objects that were there in my deep pockets, it was my way of talking to them and reassuring them . Or I buried them, or threw them into the sea, with all my strength as far as possible from the land .
 In this way I disposed of things I loved but could no longer keep, because of new loves . And often I missed them. But I had hidden them so well that even I could never find them again. That’s the style, as if I still had time to kill. And so I have, deep down I know it well
 A club in any case, I can’t help it, I must state the facts, without trying to understand, to the end . I wonder what my last words will be, written, but the others do not endure, but vanish, into thin air . I shall not finish this inventory either, a little bird tells me so,
 Only those things are mine the whereabouts of which I know well enough to be able to lay hold of them, if necessary, that is the definition I have adopted, to define my possessions . And as I shall never look for it any more, or for anything else, either on top of the cupboard or anywhere else, it is no longer
 If it was my hat I might put it on, that would remind me of the good old days, though I remember them sufficiently well . It is perhaps the only object in my possession the history of which I have not forgotten .
 Samuel Beckett has been in this room long enough to know that some things go out, and other things come in, through I know not what agency . Among those that go out there are some that come back, after a more or less prolonged absence, and others that never come back .
 If I had a penny I would let it make up my mind. Decidedly the night is long and poor in counsel. Perhaps I should persist until dawn. If at dawn I shall take a decision"
 The ocean looks unnatural that you’d think you were in a studio, but is it not rather the reverse 1 should say? No trace left of an\ clothes for example, apart from the boot, the hat and three socks, I counted them .
 It is some days now since my soup was renewed, did I mention that? I suppose so. Now that I have stopped eating I produce less waste and so eliminate less . The pots do not seem to be mine, I simply have the use of them .
 It is my possessions have weakened me, if I start talking about them again I shall weaken again . I should have liked to speak of the cap of my bicycle-bell, of my half-crutch,>you’d think it was a baby’s crutch . But I can still do so, what is there to
 "I have spoken softly, gone my ways softly, all my days, as behoves one who has nothing«to say, nowhere to go, and so nothing to gain by being seen or heard"
 I wonder if I could not contrive, wielding my stick like a punt-pole, to move my bed . It may well be on castors, many beds are. Incredible I should never have thought of this, all the time I have been here. Perhaps I should throv: away my lead .
 The stick, having slipped, would have plucked me from the bed if I had not let it go . I suppose the wisest thing now is to live it over again, meditate upon it and be edified .
 I thought I was turning my stick to the best possible account, like a monkey scratching its fleas with the key that opens its cage . It is obvious to me now that bV making a more intelligent use of my stick I might have extracted myself from my bed and perhaps even got myself back into it .
 Nothing is mine any more, according to my definition, except my exercise-book, my lead and the French pencil, assuming it really exists . I did well to stop my inventory, it was a happy thought . I feel less weak, perhaps they fed me while I slept . I see the pot, the one that is not full, it
 "I am calm, insufficiently, I still lack a little calm. I’ll see if there is anything in my little idea, I mean how to retrieve my stick" Macmann came to again, once again, in a kind of asylum .
 Macmann did not immediately grasp that he was being spoken to . The room, or cell, in which he lay, was thronged with men and women dressed in white . The speaker was a man, naturally, in the flower and the prime of life .
 A woman’s voice, extraordinarily shrill and unpleasant, was heard to say, Mann, his name is Macmann . The speaker turned towards this informant, glared at him for a moment, then dropped his eyes . Then, suddenly turning, he cried .
 The thin yellow arms contorted by some kind of bone deformation were at first sight her most revolting features . She wore by way of earrings two long ivory crucifixes which swayed wildly at the least movement of her head .
 In the early stages, before he had grown used to this new tide in his fortune, she assuredly left him alone as little as possible and even watched over him part of the night . She informed Macmann when he did something, if that thing was permitted or not, and similarly, when he remained inert, whether or not he was entitled
 Macmann's clothes, cleaned, pressed, mended, strewn with mothballs and folded away in a cardboard box bearing his name and number, were as safe as if they had been received in deposit »by the Bank of England .
 Moll suffered him to put it on, and even helped him to do so, helping him to sit up in the bed and arranging his pillows in such a way that he might remain propped up without fatigue . And she contemplated with tenderness the old bewildered face relaxing, and in its tod of hair the mouth trying to smile
 Macmann spent a long time in the House of Saint John of God . He did not stir from his bed, not knowing if he could walk, or even stand, and fearing to rifii foul of the authorities .
 There sprang up gradually between them a kind of intimacy which led them to lie together and copulate as best they could . But far from losing heart they warmed to their work .
 Not one day goes by that I do not give thanks to God, on my bended knees, for having found you, before I die . It was also the occasion of his penetrating into the enchanted world of reading thanks to the inflammatory letters .
 We shall not have time to grow to loathe each other, to see our youth slip by, to recall with nausea the ancient rapture, to seek in the company of third parties . But let us profit first by this superb sundown, after the long day of storm. Are you not of this opinion?
 I was never beautiful or well-proportioned, but ugly and even misshapen, to judge by the testimonies I have received . Papa notably used to say that people would run a mile from me .
 Macmann wrote the tetty-beshy to offer to his mistress, for he felt she was drifting away from him . Follow my instructions, you’ll come back for more .
 Macmann should have suc- ceeded, in . so short a time and after such inauspicious beginnings, in elevating himself to a view of this altitude . He had time to compose ten or twelve more or less in this vein, all remarkable for their exaltation of love regarded as a kind of lethal glue .
 One day just as Macmann was getting used to being loved, though without as yet responding as he was subsequently to do, he thrust Moll’s face away from his on the pretext of examining her ear-rings . As she made to return to the charge he checked her again with the first words that came into his head .
 Moll found a long yellow canine bared to the roots and carved, with the drill probably, to represent the celebrated sacrifice . She let go her lip, which sprang back into place with a smack . This incident made a strong impression on Macmann and Moll rose with him .
 Moll continued to look after Mac- mann but she was no longer the same . She had never smelt sweet, but between not smelling sweet and giving off the smell she was giving off now there is a gulf .
 Moll's hair began to fall out in abundance and she confessed to Macmann that she did not dare comb it any more . The sight of her so diminished did not damp Macmann’s desire to take her, all stinking, yellow and vomiting, in his arms .
 When Moll turned and looked at him with eyes in which he fancied he could read boundless regret and love, then a kind of frenzy seized upon him . He began to belabor with his fists his chest, his head and even the mattress, writhing and crying out . It was at this time she lost her immunity .
 Lemuel told Macmann that Moll was dead . Macmann said to himself, when she told him, that she would have made me a present of it, or at least shown it to me . Lemuel gave the impression of being slightly more stupid than malevolent .
 Lemuel remained for a long time plunged in thought, sometimes for as long as ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, motionless or scratching his head or his armpit . If asked for example to state whether Saint John of Gods was a private institution or run by the State, a hospice for the aged and infirm or a
 Moll was inflexible and their voice was stronger than the voice of love, in her heart, whenever they made themselves heard there simultaneously . BuV Lemuel was made of sterner stuff .
 Lemuel's cries were of two kinds, those having no other cause than moral anguish and those, similar in every respect, by means of which he hoped to forestall same . Physical pain, on the contrary, seemed to help him greafly . Lemuel came to a standstill when he hit Lemuel with a hammer in the middle

 'I don’t doubt he gave me due warn- ing, before he hit me. He’s gone now. What an idea, all the same, to hit me on the head' The light has been queer ever since, oh I insinuate nothing, dim and at the same time radiant .
 "He hit me, about ten o’clock probably. In the afternoon he did not touch me, though I did not see him immed- iately" "He must have been here from nine to twelve, then from two to six, now I have it. Perhaps he will come back to-morrow" Black suit of antiqu
 The only thing you must never speak of is your happiness, I can think of nothing else for the moment . My voice has gone dead, the rest will follow. I had things to ask him, to give me my stick for example .
 I did so without thinking that he had been there for some time (otherwise he would not have struck me) watching me writing . For of all I ever had in this world all has been taken from me, except the exercise-book, so T cherish it, it's human . The lead too, I w <t s forgetting the
 It was so long sine# I had seen a biped of this description I thought he was going to kill me, with its long sharp point, he had only to plunge it in my heart . Perhaps he will come back to-morrow, better equipped, or with an assistant, now that he is familiar with the premises .
 Here lies Malone at last, with the dates to give a faint idea of the time he took to be excused and then to distinguish him from his name-sakes . Funny I never ran into one, to my knowledge, not one. people .

 Oh he did not vanish, after the fashion of a ghost, no, I heard him, the clank when he took out his watch, the satisfied thump of the umbrella on the floor, the rightabout, the rapid steps towards the door, its soft closing* and finally, I am sorry I was thinking of him, trying to
 All the people I have ever caught a glimpse of, at close quarters or at a distance, may file past from now on, that is obvious . They will all be armed with something to lean on and rummage in my things with, they will all give me a clout on the head to begin with .
 The Lord Mayor of Cork lasted for ages, but he was young, and then he had political eonvictions . How is it I am not thirsty? There must be drinking going on- inside me, my secretions .
 The final part of Samuel Becket's autobiography is written from the point of view of a man who has lost his life . The author begins by writing about himself before writing about the rest of his life and the people he has met .
 Macmann took the air in all weathers, from morning to night . More than once they had been obliged to go out looking for him with lanterns, to bring him back to his cell .
 Lemuel went out alone, in silence, as always when he knew what he had to do, straight to the bush in which Macmann had made his lair, whenever this was necessary . Macmann, weary of not being alone went away alone and back into his cell and remained there until Lemuel rejoined him .
 Lemuel struck Macmann with a stick until Lemuel told him to stop . Then Lemuel took it from him and struck him with it over and over again, no, that won't work . Lemuel called a keeper by the name of Pat, a thorough brute though puny in appearance .
 No questions were ever asked in the House of Sain John of God, but stern measures were simply taken, or not token, according to tTie dictates of a peculiar logic .
 The gulls were many in stormy weather which paused here on their flight inland . They wheeled long in the cruel air, screeching with anger, then settled in the grass or on the house-to'^s . The air was filled with their voices, especially at dawn and dusk .
 The writer describes a plateau with gentle slopes . The entire top was occupied by the domain of Saint John . From here a fine view was to be obtained of the plain, the sea, the mountains, the smoke of the town and the buildings of the institution .
 Macmann sometimes wondered what was lacking to his happiness . The right to be abroad in all weathers morning, noon and night, trees and bushes with outstretched branches to wrap him round and hide him, food and lodging such as they were free of all charge .
 SAMUEL BECKETT pare it with what it had been he had had enough of, until he lost it, and would have enough of again, when he got it back again . He stated, for he was artless, I have had enough, without pausing a moment to reflect .
 Macmann could not understand shapes passed that he couldn't understand . A keeper came out of one of the lodges, in obedience to a telephone-call probably, all in white, a long black object in his hand, r key . Suddenly there were women. The heavy gates swung open, driving the keeper before them .
 Others besides Macmann strayed from morning to night, stooped under the heavy cloak, in the rare glades . They seldom came near to one another, because they were few and the park was vast . But when chance brought one or more together, near enough for them to realize it had done so, then they hastened to turn back
 Macmann tore up this photograph and threw the bits in the air, one windy day . What he liked best in this picture was the chair, the seat of which seemed to be made of straw .
 Lemuel slept on the bare boards and even off them ate his lesser meals . The long silver carpet was in position, ending in a point, trembling across the calm repouss .
 Lady Pedal was not the only one to take an interest in the inmates of Saint John of God’s . She was seconded by other ladies sharing her way of thinking and similarly blessed in means and leisure .
 Lemuel ate six pieces of bacon, his own and the five others, ate all the fat off them, sucked the rinds and threw them back in the soup . When his bucket had been filled Lemuel withdrew to a secluded place, rolled up his sleeve to the elbow, fished up from the bottom of the bucket, f
 SAMUEL BECKETT was called the Saxon, though he was far from being any such thing . Anxiously he watched Lemuel performing his office, filling his pot .
 A small thin man was pacing up and down, his cloak folded over his arm, an umbrella in his hand . In the fourth a misshapen giant, bearded, occupied to the exclusion of all else in scratching him- self, intermittently . Sprawling on his pillow on the floor under the window, his head sunk, his mouth open
 In the MALONE DIES 285 fifth Macmann writes: 'A few lines to remind me that I too subsist. Indubitably going, that's all that matters'
 Lemuel held Macmann by the arm as he tried to free him from his cell . Macmann was furious at having been shut up in his cell all morning and at a loss to understand what was wanted of him .
 Lemuel, Macmann, the Saxon and the giant sat on one of the seats, set parallel to the wheels . In the other, facing them the youth, the thin one and the two colossi dresseU in sailor-suits .
 Lady Pedal was pleased to interpret the Saxon's roar as a manifestation of joy . The waggonette jolted on with gather- ing speed .
 Lemuel produced a hatchet from under his cloak and dealt himself a few smart blows on the skull, with the heel, for safety . Marmu.m made a bid for freedom. In vain. Lemuel .
 Lemuel and Lady Pedal were on their way back to their parents . The giant had refused to leave the boat, so that the Saxon could not leave it either . Macmann was not free either, Lemuel held him by the waist, perhaps lovingly .
 Lemuel released Mac- mann, went up behind Maurice who was sitting on a stone filling his pipe and killed him . Lady Pedal appeared, joyous, calling calling. Come along, she cried, before the tea gets cold . But at the sight of the late sailors she fainted .
 Lemuel made Macmann and the two others get into the boat and got into it himself . Then they set out, all six, from the shore . This tangle of grey bodies is they. Silent, dim, perhaps cling- ing to one anerther .
 Lemuel is in charge, he raises his hatchet on which the blood will never dry, but not to hit anyone, he will not hit anyone any more . Or with his hammer or with his stick or with . his fist or in thought in dream I mean never he will .
 "I shall not be alone, in the beginning. I am of course alone. That is soon said. And how can one be sure, in such darkness? I shall have company. A few puppets"
 The best is not to decide anything, in this connection, in advance . If a thing turns up, for some reason or another, take it into consideration . Does this mean that when you admit the former you must also admit the latter?
 The brimless hat seems to me conclusive. With his two hands he props up his jaw. Perhaps he does not see roe. One of these days I’ll challenge him. There are no days here, but I use the ex-pression .
 Is not this rather the place where one finishes vanishing? Will the day come when Malone will pass before me no more? Is there other pits, deeper down? Are there other places set aside for us and this one where I an;, with Malone, merely their narthex?
 I owe my existence to no one, these faint fires are not of those that illuminate or bum. there . If I accom- plish other natural functions it is unawares. Nothing ever troubles me .
 Malone appears and disappears with the punc- tuality of clockwork, always at the same remove, the same velocity, in the same direction . It is only fair to say that to eyes less knowing than mine they would probably pass unseen .
 Has nothing really changed since I have been here? No, frankly, hand on heart, wait a second, no, nothing, to my knowledge . I like to think ^occupy the centre, but nothing is less certain .
 Samuel Beckett is convinced he is not deaf, but half-convinced . The silence here is almost unbroken, but it is not com- 298 SAMUEL BECKETT pletely so .
 After a long period of immaculate silence a feeble cry was heard, by me . After so long a silence a little cry, stifled outright? Impossible to say. What kind of creature uttered it and, if it is the same, still does, from time to time?
 A man may die at the age of seventy without ever hav- ing had the possibility of seeing Halley’s comet . "I await its recurrence without impatience. I shall say therefore that our beginnings coincide, that this place was made for me, and I for it, at the same instant"
 I continue to see Malone as darkly as the first time. My eyes being fixed always in the same direction I can only see, as clearly as the visibility "permits, that which takes place immediately in front of me"
 The things they have told me! About men, the light of day. I refused to believe them. But some of it has stuck. They also gave me the low-down on God . They told me I depended on him, in the last analysis. They had it on the reliable authority of his agents at Bally .
 When did all this nonsense stop? And has it stopped? Is it merely a lull? Is he still usurping my name, the one they foisted on me?
 The other advances full upon me. He emerges as from heavy hangings, advances a few steps, looks at me, then backs away . What I see best is his hat. The crown is all worn through, like the sole of an old boot, giving vent to a straggle of grey hairs .
 The interval may vary considerably, and indeed it seems to me it does, without ever being abolished . Nevertheless I am inclined to think, because of this erratic interval, that my two visitors may some day meet before my eyes, collide and perhaps even knock each other down .
 In order to speak, one starts speaking as if it were possible to stop at will . The search for the means to put an end to things is what enables the discourse to continue . No, I must not try to think, simply utter .
 Is it I who cast the faint light that enables me to see what goes on under my nose? There is nothing to be gained, for the moment, by supposing so . There is no night so deep, so I have heard tell, that it may not be pierced in the end .
 The days of sticks are over, here I can count on my body alone, my body incapable of the smallest movement and whose very eyes can no longer close as they once could . How, in such conditions, can I write, to consider only the manual aspect of that bitter folly?
 I am Matthew and I am the angel, I who came before the cross, before the sinning, came into the world, came here. I could know. But I shall not know. Not this time. I add this, to be on the safe side.
 What I say, what I may say, on this subject, has already been said since, having always been here, I am here still . At last a piece of reasoning that pleases me, and yet I am anxious. So I am not heading for disaster .
 "I hope this preamble will soon come to an end and the state- ment begin that will dispose of me" "Take your choice, which spews me out or swallows me"
 "I’ll never know, which is perhaps merely the inside of my distant skull where once I wan- The UNNAMABLE 305 dered, now am fixed, lost for tininess, or straining against the walls, with my head, hands, feet, and ever murmuring my old stories .
 Prometheus was delivered twenty-nine thou-sand nine hundred and seventy years after having purged his offence . Prometheus: "I thought I was right in enlisting these sufferers of my pains. I was wrong. They never suffered my pains, their pains are nothing"
 There is no one here but me, no one has ever met anyone before my eyes, these creatures have never been, only I and this black void have ever been . And Basil and his gang? Inexistent, invented to explain I forget what. it .
 I know my eyes are open, because of the tears that pour from them unceasingly . I feel my back straight, my neck stiff and free of twist and up on top of it the head . Then there is the way of flowing of my tears which flow all over my face, and even down along the neck .
 "I feel my tears coursing over my chest, my sides, and all down my back. They gather in my beard and from there, when it can hold no more — no, no beard, no hair either" "I have often asked myself this question, then suddenly started talking about Malone's hat, or Molloy's great
 I invented love, music, the smell of flowering currant, to escape from me . Organs, a without, it's easy to imagine, a god, it’s unavoidable, you imagine them, the worst is dulled, you doze away, an instant .
 All that matters is that I am round and hard, there must be reasons for that . All the rest I renounce, including this ridiculous black . What rubbish all this stuff about light and dark .
 I speak, speak, because I must, but I do not listen, I seek my lesson, my life I used to know and would not confess . Then a little hell after my own heart, not too cruel, with a few nice damned to foist my groans on, something sigh .
 Let it be assumed then that I am at rest, though this is unimportant, at rest or forever moving . As far as thinking is concerned I do just enough to preserve me from going silent, you can’t call that thinking .
 I have no voice and must speak, that is all I know, it’s round that I must revolve . Of that Imust speak, with this voice that is not mine, but can only be mine, since there is no one but ihe .
 Samuel Beckett was not inattentive the last time he heard a murmur telling of another and le«s unpleasant method of ending his troubles . He caught the murmur without ceasing for an instant to emit my he said, and he said to himself .
 "I was sufficiently impressed by certain expressions to make a vow, while continuing my yelps, never to forget them" "I see myself slip- ping, though not yet at the last cxtrcmiiV, towards the resorts of fable"
 'I suppose that I went silent, that I THE UNNAMABLE 311 can go silent. And now this noise again. That is all rather obscure' 'One might as well speak and be done with it. What liberty! What liberty!'
 Until he left me for good, or refused to leave me any more, I don’t know . Still today, as he would say, though he plagues me no more his voice is there, in mine, but less .
 'I want to go silent. Not as just now, the better to listen, but peacefully, victorious, without ulterior object. Then it would be a life worth having, a life at last'
 I was given a pensum, at birth perhaps, as a punishment for having been born perhaps, or for no particular reason, because they dislike me . But was I ever told? Squeeze, squeeze, not too hard, but squeeze a little longer, this is perhaps about you, and your goal at hand .
 The writer is unable to find the right pensum to say his lesson . When he has finished his pensum he will still have to reconstitute the right lesson .
 Carmagnole says he has to say something about himself in order to be believed . He asks himself if he should praise his master or admit that he is Mahood . It seems impossible, at this stage, that I should dispense with questions, as I promised myself I would .
 The master did. Rich matter there, to be exploited, fatten you up, suck it to the core, keep you going . I never paid him enough attention. No more perhapses either, that old trick is worn to a thread. I’ll forbid myself everything, then go on as if I hadn’t .
 My master then, assuming he is solitary, in my image, wishes me well, poor devil, wishes my good, and if he does not seem to do very much in order not to be dis- appointed it is because there is not very much to be done . Another supposition, he has taken the necessary steps, his will is done
 I want all to be well with you, do you hear me, that’s what he keeps on dinning at me . To which I reply, in a respectful attitude, I too, your Lordship. I say that to cheer him up., he sounds so unhappy. No, we have no conversation, never a mum of his
 "What he wants is my good, I know that, at least I say it, in the hope of bringing him round to a more reasonable frame of mind"
 Samuel Beckett says he is 'free, abandoned. All for nothing again. Even Mahood has left me. I’m alone'
 No one compels me to, there is no one, it’s an accident, a fact. Not to have been a dupe will have been my best possession, my best deed. I have nothing to do, that is to say nothing in particular . I have the ocean to drink, so there is an ocean then .
 "Even Mahood’s stories are not any old thing, though no less foreign, to what, to that unfamiliar native land of mine"
 This time I .im short of a leg. ThatS part of the prognynme. Having brought me to death’s door, senile gangrene, they whip There I am launched again on the same old hopeless business .
 "I've been he an instant, hobbling through a nature which, it is only fair to say, was on the barren side" "I'm not far short of a man, just barely a man"
 After each thrust of crutches I stopped, to devour a narcotic and measure the distance gone, the distance yet to go . "I'm confoundedly well informed. You must allow it was tempting"
 The writer was stuck in an ellipse . He was unable to go any further .
 It seems to me that once beyond the equator you would start turning inwards again, out of sheer necessity, I some- how have that feeling . But obstacles can be removed in the fullness of time, but not by me, me they would stop dead forever, if I lived among them .
 In 320 SAMUEL BECKETT was returning to the fold, admittedly reduced, and doubtless fated to be even more so . He found himself in a kind of vast yard or campus, surrounded by high walls, its surface an amalgam of dirt and ashes . At the centre of this enclosure stood a small rotunda, windowless
 The children increased in stature, the periods of Ptomaine grew pale, the ancients glowered at each other, muttering, to themselves . They did not want to check the impetus that was sweeping me towards them . According to Mahood I never reached them, that is to say they all died first, the whole ten or eleven of
 My missing leg didn’t seem to affect them, perhaps it was already missing when I left. And yet he was a fine baby. He looks as if he had slowed down, since last year .
 Samuel Beckett's wife announced the latest news, for them to take to bed with them . The narrators themselves, torn from their melan- choly thoughts, could scarce forbear to smile . They all rose, with the exception of my mother whose knees couldn't support her, and sang .
 Malone: "I was entirely absorbed in the business on hand and not at all concerned to know precisely, or even approximately, what it consisted in" The only problem for me was how to continue, since I could not do otherwise, in the motion which had been imparted to me"
 Well supplied with pain-killers I drew upon them freely, without however permitting myself the lethal dose that would have cut short my functions . Never once have I stopped. My halts do not count. Their purpose was to enable me to go on .
 In reality I had sutik to the ground of my own free will, in order to be rid of my crutches and have both hands available to minister to myself . Admittedly it is difficult, for a man with but one leg, to sink to earth in the full force .
 Mahood dixit suggested that the misfortune experienced by my famity and brought to my notice first by the noise of their agony, then by the smell of their corpses, had caused me to turn back . From that moment on I ceased to go along with him. I’ll explain why, that will permit me to think of something
 'My good-will at certain moments is such, and my longing to have floundered how- ever briefly, however feebly, that I, no, parenthesis unfinished. I’ll begin again'
 Let us rather consider what really took place, if Mahood was telling the truth . And why should he have lied to me, he so anxious to obtain my adhesion, to his conception of me? Why? For fear of paining me perhaps . But I am there to be pained, that is what my tempters have never grasped
 It is some considerable time now since I last knew what I was talking about, it is because my thoughts are elsewhere . I am therefore forgiven . So long as one’s thoughts arc somewhere everything is permitted, as if nothing had happened .
 Samuel Beckett claims he was forced to vomit by the stench of his family's remains . He claims he felt annoyance at having to flounder in such muck at the moment when his closing contortions called for a firm and level surface .
 "I was never anywhere but here, no one ever got me out of here," he writes . "I have no preference, Isolde’s breast would have done just as well, or papa's private parts, or the heart of one of the little bastards"
 WYiat: What I speak of, what I speak with, all comes from them. How they must hate me! Ah a nice state they have me in, but still I'm not their creature, not quite, not yet .
 Mahood is silent, that is to say his voice continues, but is no longer renewed . Nothing will remain of all the lira they have glutted me with . And I’ll be myself at last, as a starveling belches his odourless wind .
 "They’ve blown me up with their voices, like a balloon, and even as I collapse it’s them I hear. Who, them? And why have I heard from them lately?"
 I’ll fix their jargon for thern, then any old thing, no matter what, whatever they want, with a will, till time is done, at least with a good grace . I am neither, I needn't say, Murphy, nor Watt, nor Mercier, nor — no, I can’t even
 I might as well tell another of Mahood’s stories and no more about it;, to be understood in the way I was given to understand it . This will leave me free to consider how I may best proceed with my own affair .
 "I do not move and never shall again, unless it be under the impulsion of a third party" When I come to the coast I turn back inland. And my course is not helicoidal, I got that wrong too"
 Police tolerate 330 SAMUEL BECKETT by the police . They know I am speechless and consequently in- capable of taking unfair advantage of my situation . The fact is I trouble no one, except possibly that category of hypersensitive persons .
 Once a week I was taken out of my receptacle, so that it might be emptied . This duty fell to the pro- prietress of the chop-house across the street . The state of my skull, covered with pustules and bluebottles, preserved me from being an object of envy for many .
 No sooner had the tarpaulin settled over me, and the precipitate steps of my benefactress died away, than the tears began to flow . This not merely once, but every time she covered me, that is to say twice or three times a year .
 Samuel Beckett is a writer who lives in the south of England . He has written a book about his experiences in the South .
 Snow alone, provided of course it is heavy, entitles me to the tarpaulin . I have tried to make her understand that I should like to be shrouded more often .
 The trouble is I forget how it goes on. But did I ever know? Perhaps it stops there, perhaps they stopped it there. There you are now, you don’t need us any more. But let us see how it is supposed to end, that will sober me.
 "I may perhaps legiti- mately suppose that the one-armed one-legged wayfarer of a moment ago ftnd the wedge-headed trunk in which I am now marooned are simply two phases of the same carnal envelope" "To saddle me with a lifetime is probably not enough for them, I have to be
 "I have dwindled, I dwindle. Not so long ago, with a kind of shrink of my head and shoulders, as when one is scolded, I could disappear" SAMUEL BECKETT was blinded by the jar a few inches from the edge of it .
 "I could never bear to be idle, it saps one's energy" For the woman, dis- pleased at seeing me sink lower and lower, has raised me up by filling the bottom of my jar with sawdust which she changes every week, when she makes my toilet . It is softer than the stone, but less hygien
 I can no longer, because of my roguish character, move my head in arjd out, as in the good old days . For a collar, fixed to the mouth of the jar, now encircles my neck, just below the chin . And my lips which used to be hidden, and which I sometimes pressed against the
 "To have forever before my eyes, when I opeif them, approximately the same set of hallucinations exactly, is a joy I might never have known, but for my cang. mockery!"
 Samuel Beckett's last words to himself were: 'Come come, a little co- operation please, finish dying, it's the least you might do'
 If only I were alive inside one might look forward to heart-failure, or infarctus . But perhaps they would consider themselves sufficiently rewarded if I simply waited for the wind to blow me over . The trouble is there is no wind equal to it. The cliff would have to cave in under me .
 'It is clear in any case that I have lost heart too lightly, it is quite possible I have all that is required to give them satisfaction' 'Already I’m beginning to be there no more, in that calamitous street they made so clear to me'
 "Little by little I’ll get used to it, admonished by them, used to the scene. And at my next appearance, if I ever appear again, all will be new, new and strange"
 Two falsehoods, two trappings, to be borne to the end, before I can be let loose, alone, in the unthinkable unspeakable . It will perhaps be less restful than I appear to think .
 I have to speak in a certain way, with warmth perhaps, all is possible . Warmth, ease, conviction, the right manner, as if it were my own voice . Words pronouncing me alive, since that's how they want me to be, I don't know why .
 The UNNAMABLE VET has no information up to date about himself . But he is a prey to communications . Faint calls, at long intervals, are not connected statements . Let them come. Be yourself again!
 'I have naturally remarked? in a moment of exceptional receptivity, that these exhortations are conveyed to be by the same channel as that used by Malone and Co. for their transports. That’s suspicious, or rather would be if I still hoped to obtain, from these revelations to come, some truth of more value than those
 Samuel Beckett is best known for his work on The Godfather . He has written a book about his experiences, called Samuel .
 "It's time I gave this solitary a name, nothing doing without proper names. I therefore baptise nim Worm. It was high time. I don't like it, but I haven't much choice" It will be my name too, when I needn’t be called Mahood any more, if that happy time ever
 If I am Mahood. I am Worm too., plop. Or if I am not yet Worm, I shall be when I cease to be Mahood, plop . Worm is not to blame for this, that's soon said .
 What a joy to know where one is, and where one will stay, without being there . The essential is never to arrive anywhere, never to be anywhere, neither where Mahood is, nor where Worm is .
 "I swear it, the other never caught me, I was never delivered from him, it’s past history, up to the present" "I am he who will never be caught, never delivered, who crawls be- tween the thwarts, towards the new day that promises to be glorious"
 Watt: 'Perhaps it's by trying to be Worm that I’ll finally succeed in being Mahood, 1 hadn’t thought of that' Watt: "Perhaps it’s the characteristic, among others, of Mahood to note, even if he does not always succeed in doing so, certain things"
 It is the hour of the aperitif, already people pause, to read the menu . I knew I had only to try and talk of Worm to begin talking of Mahood, with more felicity and understanding than ever . How close to me he suddenly seems, squinting up at the medals of the hippophagist Duc
 This evening there is tripe. It’s a winter dish, or a late autumn one. Soon Marguerite will come and light me up. By ten o’clock in the evening all is silent, as the g^jjive, as they say .
 Samuel Beckett writes about his thoughts while waiting for something intelligible to take place . Almost immediately a thought presents itself, he should concentrate more often .
 'I have no smell either. How, under these conditions, can Mahood expect me to behave normally? The flies vouch for me, if you like, but how far? Would they not settle with equal appetite on a lump of cowshit?'
 I should further remark, with regard to this testimony which I consider indispensable, that I shall soon be in no fit condition to receive it, so greatly have my faculties declined, in recent times . It is obvious we have here a principle of change pregnant with possibilities . But say T succeed in dying, to adopt the most comfortable* hypothesis, without
 Mahood once knew a doctor who held that scientifically speaking the latest breath could only issue from the . fundament and this therefore, rather than the . mouth, the orifice to which the family shoiftd pre-sent the mirror, before opening the will . However this may be, and without dwelling further on these macabre details, it is
 The bliss of what he has achieved is clear, simple and exhausting . The next thing is somehow to connect this with Madeleine and her great goodness . But enough of this cursed first person, it is really too red a herring .
 The belief in God is sometimes lost following a period of intensified zeal and observance . It is easier to raise a shrine than bring the deity down to haunt it. It is not sur- prising then she should have. She loves me. I’ve always felt it. She needs me .
 There was a time I thought she was perhaps a near relation, mother, sister, daughter, or such- like, perhaps even a wife, and that she was sequestrating me . Mahood, seeing how little impressed I was by his chief witness, whispered this suggestion in my ear, adding, I didn’t say THE UNN
 It is not a night like other nights. The lanterns have not been lit. Perhaps dinner is over. Perhaps Marguerite has come and gone, come again and gone again, without my having noticed her .
 Samuel Beckett left the world of his former life behind him . The stories of Mahood are ended. He has realised they could not be about me, he has aban- doned, it is I who win .
 'I say what I am told to say, in the hope that some day they will weary of talking at me' 'They'll never get the better of my stupidity'
 "I wish him a happy time. Worm to play, his lead, I wish him every success, in his courageous undertaking"
 He who seeks his true countenance, let him be of good cheer, he’ll find it, convulsed with anguish, the eyes out on stalks . He who longs to have lived, while he was alive . The one outside of life we always were in toe end, all ojr long vain life long .
 "I have no voice, in this matter I have none. That’s one of the reasons why I confused myself with Worm . But I have no reasons either, no reason. I’m like Worm, without voice or reason" If I were Worm I wouldn't know it, I wouldn’t say it .
 They say that when I have failed to be Worm I’ll be Mahood, automatically, on the rebound . But they’re wrong, T need explanations, of every- thing, and even then, I don’t understand . Ah if they could only begin, and do what they want with me, and succeed at
 They think I can’t bear silence, that some day, sdhiehow, my horror of silence will force me to break it . But they dare not be silent for long, the whole fabrication might collapse . Ah if I could only find a voice of my own, in all this babble, it would be the end of
 Samuel Beckett was a student at the University of Cambridge . He wrote a book about his experience of being a ventriloquist . Now he has forgotten who Worm is, he will begin to be him .
 Where am I? That’s my first question, after an age of listening. From it, when it hasn’t been answered. I’ll rebound towards others, of a more personal nature, much later . Poor*Worm, who thought he was different, there he is in the mad-house for life .
 'I still leave much to be desired, I have no technique' 'I need nobody, they’ll start sprouting under my arse, unaided'
 'I don’t yet know how to move, either locally or in relation to myself, or bodily' 'What doesn't come to me from me has come to the wrong address' 'My understanding is not yet sufficiently well-oiled to function with- out some critical circumstance'
 Samuel Beckett reflects on his life in prison . "I sometimes seem to remember what I was like when I was Worm, and not yet delivered into their hands"
 "I remember, and shall never forget, what I was like when I was he, before all became confused" "It seems to me too, which is even more deplorable, that I could become Worm again"
 "I don't hear what they say, all I know is they are still there, they haven't done, with me" Or if there is only one it is he alone, taking counsel with himself" There arc long silences too, at long intervals, during which, hearing nothing, I say nothing .
 The moment one can say. Someone is on his way, all is well is well. Perhaps I have still a thousand years to go. Perhaps it’s Botal's Foramen, when all about me palpitates and labours . Can it be I have a friend among them, shaking his head in sorrow and saying nothing.
 Samuel Beckett was born in 1856 and is the son of a woman who died in childbirth . He has written a book about his experiences .
 Mahood says he suffers like 'true thinking flesh, but I’m sorry, I feel nothing' Mahood felt the cang, flies, the sawdust under my stumps, the tarpaulin on my skull, when they were mentioned to him .
 Let them scourge me without ceasing and evermore, more and more lustily . In the end I might begin to look as if I had grasped the meaning of life . They might even take a breather from time to time, without my ceasing to howl .
 The meeflanism matters little, provided I succeed in saying, before I go deaf . Millions of different sounds, always the same, recurring without pause, are all one requires to sprout a head .
 "I’d demand no more of m rt - than to know that what I hear is not the innocent and necessary sound of dumb things constrained to endure, but the terror-stricken babble of tTie condemned to silence"
 Worm is now with breath in his nostrils, it only remains for him to suffocate . The thorax rises and falls, the wear and tear are in full spring, the rot spreads down . To see him flooded with light, then suddenly plunged back in darkness, must strike them as irresistibly funny .
 A head has grown out of his ear, the better to enrage him, that must be it . It’s a transformer in which sound is turned, without the help of reason, to rage . The circumvolutionisation will be seen too later, when they get him out .
 Worm, who says nothing, knows nothing, yet . Similarly turn about they benefit by the peep-hole, those who care to . But what hope has sustained them, all the time they have been employed?
 There is a clue of the highest interest, it matters little to what. They look, to see if he has stirred. He is nothing but a shapeless heap, without a face capable of reflecting the niceties of a torment . No matter where he goes he will go towards them .
 The voice will begin again, low at first, then louder, coming from the quarter they want him to retreat from . In this way they’ll bring him to the wall, and even to the precise point where they have made other holes through which to pass their arms and seize him . How physical this all is!
 Worm cannot set himself in motion, though he often desires to . It is a blessing for him he cannot stir, even though he suffers because of it . It would be to sign his life-warrant.
 Fen is now in a pit, no avenue will have Feen left unexplored . According to the latest news, he’ll have to climb to reach him . It is strange they do not go and fetch him in his den, since the> seem to have access to it .
 The slopes are 362 SAMUEL BECKETT gentle that meet where he lies, they flatten out under him . They don’t know what to say, to be able to believe in him, what to invent .
 He who is alone, and mute, lost in the smoke, it is not real smoke, there is no fire, no matter, strange hell that has no heating, no denizens . Perhaps it’s paradise, perhaps it's the light of paradise, and the solitude, and this voice the voice of the blest interceding
 Tears gush from it practically without ceasing, why is not known, nothing is known . Perhaps it’s the voice that makes it weep, with rage, or some other passion, or at having to see, from time to time, some sight or other, perhaps that's it . Perhaps he weeps in order not to see
 Worm hears, that’s all can be said for certain, whereas there was a time he didn’t, the same Worm, according to them, he has therefore changed . The eye too, of course, is there to put him to flight, make him take fright, badly enough to break his bonds, they call that bonds
 Worm being in the singular, as it turned out, they are in the plural, to avoid confusion, confusion is better avoided, pending the great confound . All will come right, later on in the evening, everyone gone and silence restored .
 A man would wonder where his kingdom ended, his eye strive to penetrate the gloom, and he crave for a stick, an arm, fingers apt to grasp and then release, at the right moment, a stone, stones, or for the power to utter a cry . But Worm suffers only from the noise which prevents him from being what he was
 Perhaps one day brightness will come, little by little, or rapidly, or in a sudden flood, and then it is hard to see how Worm could stay . But impossible situa- tions cannot be prolonged, unduly . Either they disperse, or else they turn out to be possible after all, it’s only to be expected
 There must be something else, to go with this grey, which goes with everything . Let others hope for him, outside, in the cool, ift the light, if they have a wish to, or if they are obliged to .
 Passing by at the right distance, the right level, say once a month, that’s not exorbitant, full face and profile, like criminals . It might even pause, open its mouth, raises its eyebrows, bless its soul, stutter, mutter, howl, groan and finally shut up .
 A ball, revolving one knows not how about him, that would be better than nothing . Unfortunately we must stick to the facts, for what else is there, to stick to, to cling to, when all founders, but the facts .
 "I see me, I see my place, there is nothing to show it, nothing to dis- tinguish it" "If only this voice would stop, for a second, it would seem long to me"
 Worm should have fled, but where, how, he’s riveted . He should have dragged himself away, no matter where, to- wards them, towards the azure, but how could he, he can’t 6tir, there are no bonds here . If only I knew what they want, they want me
 3%S SAMUEL BECKETT: 'It's like slime, paradise, it would be paradise, but for this noise' 'There’s no air here, air is to make you choke, light is to close your eyes'
 'They fixed their lamps in the holes, their long lamps, to prevent them from closing of themselves' 'The grey means nothing, the grey silence is not necessarily a mere lull, to* be got through somehow, it may be final, or it may not be final . It's a question of elimina- tion .
 Lamps unattended will not bum on forever, on the contrary, they will go out, little by little, without attendants to charge them anew, and go silent, in the end . Then all will start over again, obviously . So it will never be known, Worm will never know, let the silence be black, or let it be
 Worm will see the light in a desert, the light of day, the desert day . They say it’s purer, clearer, a fat lot of difference that will make . Do this, do that, you’ll see him squirm, you'll hear him weep .
 Worm is an idea they have, a word they use, when speaking of them, enough about them . If he could escape from this light, which makes him suffer, is it not obvious it would make him suffer more and more, in whatever direction he went? They say they do. But it’s impossible. As long as he
 A little fit of impatience, on the part of the patient. That is the immediate object. Afterwards there will be others. But for the moment let him toss and turn at least, roll on the ground, damn it all .
 "No one asks him to think, simply to suffer, always in the same way" "To be on the watch and never sight, to listen for the moan that never comes, that’s not a lift? worth living either"
 Samuel Beckett is writing a book about his experiences in the military . The book, published by Simon & Schuster, is due out next year .
 "I expiate vilely, like a pig, dumb, uncomprehending, possessed of no utterance but theirs" "I've always been in a dungeon, I hear everything, every word they say, it’s the only sound, as if I were speaking, to myself"
 "I must doze off from time to time, with open eyes, and yet nothing changes, ever. Gaps, there have always been gaps, it’s the voice stopping, the voice failing to carry to me, what can it matter?"
 When all goes silent, and comes to THE UNNAMABLE 3f3 an end, it will be because the words have been said, those it behoved to say . They have to be ratified by the proper authority, that takes time . Perhaps they are somewhere there, the words that count, in what has just been said .
 We’ll have to go through it all again, in other words, or in the same words, arranged differently . Respite then, once in a way, if one can call that respite, when one waits to know one’
 "There is nothing for it but to wait for the end, nothing but for theend to come, and at the end all will be the same" "If only this voice could stop, this meaningless voice which prevents you from being nothing"
 Mahood will emerge from his urn and make his way towards Montmartre, on his belly, singing, 'I come, I come, my heart’s delight' Or Worm, perhaps he won’t be able to bear any more, of not being able to . of not . being able, of . not being
 The mistake they make is to speak of him as if he really existed, in a specific place, whereas the whole thing is no more than a project for the moment . But let them blundef on to the end of their folly, then they can go into the question again, taking care not to compromise themselves .
 "They achieve nothing, neither what they want, without knowing exactly what, nor the obscure infamy to which they are committed" "What can you expect, they don’t know who they are either, nor where they are, nor what they’re doing, nor why everything is going so badly"
 Worm is notoriously secretive, and has never been seen in public with Mahood . There are signs of life, the fall of a pin, the stirring of a leaf, or the little cry that frogs give when they are spiked .
 The eye weeps for the least little thing, a yes, a no, the yesses make it weep . The grounds for these staggering pronouncements do not always receive the attention they deserve . But it’s time Mahood was forgotten, he should never be forgotten .
 Mahood will stay where he was put, stuck up to his skull in his vase, opposite the shambles . Without a word, or a ges- ture, or any play of his features, they don’t play .
 How can you think and speak at the same time? 'Without a special gift, your thoughts wander, your words too, far apart,' he says . Between them would be the place to be, where you suffer, rejoice.'
 It’s a lucky thing they are there, meaning anywhere, to bear the responsibility of this state of affairs, with respect to which if one does not know a great deal one knows at least this, that one would not care to have it on one's conscience .
 From it you set out to look for a face, to it you return having found nothing, nothing worth having, nothing but a kind of ashen smear . He is hairless and naked and his hands, laid fiat on his knees once and for all, are in no danger .
 "I too have thS right to be shown impossible. This will never end, there’s no sense in fooling oneself, yes it will, they’ll come round to it" "We were foolish to accuse one another, the master me, them, themselves"
 "Thanks to me all will be over, and they'll depart, one by one, or they’ll drop," he writes . "Bewitching prospect if ever there was one, they are beginning to come round to my opinion"
 Worm is always called to the rescue when things go badly, he talks all the time of merit and situations . But what suffering, since he has always suffered, damps the rejoicings . He soon makes up for it, he puts all to rights again .
 "I assure you, at your age, to have no identity, it’s a scandal, I assure you," he said . "Look at this photograph, what, you see nothing, true for you, no matter"
 "I beg your pardon, have I nothing else, why certainly, certainly, just a second, curious you should Vnention it, I was wondering myself, if you were not rather" "I’ve said nothing, I haven’t stirred, they don't understand, I can't stir, they think I don�
 "I’ll bo in the bag, that’s how I see it, I see nothing, they don’t understand" "I can't go to them, they’'ll have to come and get me, if they want me"
 'That’s a darling dream I’ve been having, a broth of a dream,' he writes . 'Here comes another, to see what has hap- pened to his pal, and get him out'
 "All the dogs came crawling and dug the dog a tomb and wrote upon the tombstone for dogs and bitches to come, third verse, as the first, fourth," he said . "Our hell will be heaven to them, after what you’ve done to them," he added .
 Spermatozoon. 383 is the name of a fictional character . The book is about a young boy who becomes a sperm .
 "I’m tempted, no, the testis has yet to descend that would want any truck with me, it’s mutual, another gleam down the drain"
 The book is called Samuel Beckett’s Colic pains. It won’t take long, I’ve the bloody flux. Be bom, dear friends, be bom, enter my arse .
 "I've pelted him with twaddle, the dear departed, wondering what he could possibly be like, wondering where we could possibly have met" "I am de#r to them, now it’s they are dear to me" "They’ll join us, one by one"
 T’m alone here, the first and the last, I never made anyone suffer . I’ll never know peace, neither will they, but with this difference, that they don’t want it, they say they don't want it . After all perhaps they’re right, how could I want it? T
 There’s an audience in a public show, you buy your seat and you wait . You hear a voice, someone reciting, selected passages, old favourites, a poetry matinee, or someone improvising . You can’t leave, you’re afraid to leave, it might be .
 "I prefer that, what a memory, real fly-paper, I don’t know, IDon't prefer it any more, that’s all I know, so why bother about it?" One must wait, discover a preference, within one's bosom, then it will be time enough to .

 "I’ve two surfaces and no thickness, perhaps that’s what I feel, myself vibrating," he says . "Without an ear I'll have heard, and I’ll have said it, without a mouth I will have saidIt"
 'I alone am immortal, what can you expect, I can’t get born, perhaps that’s their big idea, to keep on shying the came old thing, generation after generation, till I go mad and begin to scream, then they’ll say. no. no, they know nothing either, they forget
 'I’ll grow one, a little hole at first, then wider anil wider, deeper and deeper, the air will gush into me, and out a second later, howling'
 Samuel Beckett is best known for his novel, The Passenger, published in 2003 . He has also written a number of books on the subject .
 I’ve got nowhere, in their affair, that’s what galls them, they want me there somewhere, anywhere, if only they’d stop committing reason, on them, on me, on the purpose to be achieved, and simply go on, with no illusion about having begun one day or ever being able to
 No more stories from this day forth, and the stories go on, or it was never stories, always any old thing, for as long as you can remember, no, longer than THE UNNAMABLE 3?9 .
 "Where are you, what are you seeking, who is seeking, seek- ing who you arc, supreme aberration, where you are" Where is nature, the world of man, where is nature .
 "Where am I, where is the place where I've always been, where are the others, who is talking, not I . I hear them, I'm mute, what do they want, what have I done to them?" "What has God done to us, nothing, and Where am I?"
 "I am talking, thirsting, starving, let it stand, in the ice aid in the furnace, you feel nothing, strange, you don’t feel a mouth on you . You don't feel your mouth any more, no need of a mouth, the words are everywhere"
 "I’m all these flakes, meeting, mingling, falling asunder, wnerever I go I find me, leave me, go towards me, come from me, nothing ever but me"
 "I seek what it is I hear, I hear them, now it comes back to me" Fear of sound is past, nothing but fear, nothing of all its due but fear cen- tupled, fear of its shadow . Fear of sounds, all sounds, more or less fear, more than less fear all sounds . I seek

 There is I, on one hand, and this noise on the other, that I never doubted. I will say what is to be said and then say what it was, that will be jolly. I sum up, now that I’m there it’s I will do the summing up. There was never any doubt
 "I have only just Jaken over my functions, I and this noise, and what about it, don’t interrupt me. I’m doing my best, I repeat"
 "It has not been possible up to date to determine with certainty, or even approximately, what it is, in the way of noise," he said .
 "Silence to tell the truth does not appear to have been very conspicuous up to now, but appearances may sometimes be deceptive," he writes . It has not yet been our good fortune to establish with any degree of accuracy what I am, where I am .
 "I never threw anything away of all the things I found, never found anything that I didn't lose, never lost anything I mightn’t as well have thrown away" "If it's I what tit is, and if not I who it is, I see nothing else for the moment, I conclude .

 No. no. let it stand, when I think of the time I’ve wasted with these bran-dips, beginning with Murphy, who wasn’t even the first . Murphy and the others, and last but not least the two old buffers here present, could not stop them .
 "I’m not at home to anything, my doors are shut against them, perhaps that’s how I’ll find silence, and peace at last, by opening my doors and letting myself be devoured," he writes .
 With closed eyes I see the same as with them open, namely, wait youth . With open eyes, nothing, I see nothing, well that is disappointment . I'm looking for my mother to kill her, I should have thought of that a bit earlier .
 'I have a head now too, where all manner of things are known, can it be of me I’m speaking, is it possible, of course not, that’s another thing I know'
 "You see nothing, hear nothing, you hear the long kiss of dead water and mud, aloft at less than a score of fathoms men come and go, you dream of them" "You wonder how you know all you know, you even see grass, grass at dawn, glaucous with dew"
 'The voice is failing, it’s the first time, it has even stopped, many a time' 'I’ll go silent, for want of air, then the voice will come back and I’'ll begin again'
 "I'm going to stop, that is to say I’m going to look as if I had, it will be like everything else" "I’ll tell one of Mahood’s old tales, no matter which, they are all alike, they won't tire me"
 "I feel it's about me, perhaps that’s the mistake I make," he writes . "I’ll try again, quick befgra it goes again. There is no one left, it's embarassing, if I had a memory it might tell me that this is the sign of the end . I�
 There’s someone there, someone talking to you, about you . Then the breath fails, the end begins, you go silent, it's the end, short-lived . I hear someone calling me, it begins again, that must be how it goes .
 If only there were a thing somewhere, to talk about, even though you couldn’t see it, simply feel it there, with you, you might have the courage not to go silent . To go silent that you need courage, for you’ll be punished, punished for having gone silent .

 "I invented my memories, not knowing what I was doing, not one is of me. It is I invented him, him and so many others, and the places where they passed"
 "I did what I could, a thing beyond my strength, and often for exhaustion I gave up doing it" "I don't know if I ever lived, I have really no opinion on the subject" "The inability to speak, the inability to be silent, and/olitude, that’s what I’ve had
 I should have liked to go silent first, there were moments I thought that would be my re- ward for having spoken so long and so valiantly, to enter living into silence, so as to be able to enjoy it . I wanted myself, in my own land for a brief space, I didn’t want to die a stranger
 "I always believed I would never go silent, you can’t call that believing, it’s my walls. But has nothing really changed, all this," he said . "I’m doing as I always did, I’'m going on as best I can," he added .
 "If instead of having some- thing to say I had something to say, with my hands or feet, some little job, sorting things for example, or simply arranging things, then I’d know where I was, and how far I had got"
 'I’d be good at that, it would be a better life than this, no, I mustn’t start complaining' 'It would be moi£ com- plicated, less symmetrical, no,' he says .
 Samuel Beckett wrote a book about his experiences in prison . The book is called 'The Prisoner of Jywe' The quicker I dciit the quicker it will be done, the things one has to listen to, that’s where hope would come in .
 "I see him so well, coming and going a^'ong his casks, trying to stop his hand from trembling, dropping hili thimble, listening to it bouncing and rolling on the floor, scraping round for it with his foot" "It must have been I, but I never saw myself, so it can't have been
 "I was always aged, always ageing, and ageing makes no diffoence, not to mention that all this is not about me, hell. I’ve contradicted myself, no matter" "If I could shut myself up, it would be a mine"
 If I coiled describe this place, portray it, I’ve tried, I feel no place, no place round me, there’s no end to me, I don't know what it is, it isn’t flesh, it doesn't end, it's like air, now I have it, you say that
 The sea under my window, higher than the window, and the row- boat, do you remember? I knew I had memories, pity they arc not of me . If I could be in a forest, caught in a thicket, or wandering round in circles, it would be the end of this blither .
 "You want yourself, you want yourself in your own little corner, it’s not love, not curiosity, it's because you’re tired" "I notice one thing, the others have vanished, completely, I don’t like it" "The oUJ, meaning that I’ll give myself,
 "I'll close my eyes, all I’ll have to do is talk, that will be easy. I'll make a place, it won't be mine, it doesn't matter, I don't feel any place for me, perhaps that will come"
 I call that morning, that’s right, shilly-shally a little longer . I won’t seek my home any more, it would be occupied already . There would be someone there already, someone far gone . I smell the stable, I always smelt the stable . There's no stable but me, for me
 When plans fail there are always aspirations, it’s a knack, you must say it slowly . If only this, if only that, that gives you time, time for a cud of ljnging to rise up in the back of your gullet, nothing remains but to look as if you enjoyed chewing it .
 It’s not I speaking, it's not I hearing, let us go on as if I were the only one in the world . Laughter, opinions, comparisons, anything rather than laughter, all helps, can’t help helping .
 Samuel Beckett's latest novel is called 'I am he' and is written by Beckett himself . It's not I, I am he, after all, why not say it, I must have said it .
 I hear this horrible noise, coming back takes time, I don’t know where from, I was nearly there . Sometimes you’d think I was reasoning, I've no objection, they must have taught me reasoning too . I’ve forgotten my apodosis, but I can’’s, I�
 'I can’t suppose any- THE UNNAMABLE 4W thing, I have to go on, that’s what I’m doing, let others suppose, there must be others in other elsewheres, each one in his little else- where'
 "I am far, do you hear him, he seeks me I don't know why, he doesn’t know why" "He wants me to rise up, up into him, or up into another, let us be impartial" Then he says Murphy, or Molloy, as if 1 were Malone, but their day L
 There is no name for me, there is no pronoun for me . I seem to speak, that’s because he sa; s I as if he were I, I tlearly believed him, do you hear him. I who am far, who can’t move, can't be found., but neither can he,
 "The man on duty speaks of himself, it's not that, of others, it’s not that of others" "He doesn’t know, how could he know, whether he has spoken of that or not"
 "I don't know who it's all about, that's all I know, no, I must know something else, they must have taught me something," he says . "It's about him who knows nothing, wants nothing, can do nothing, who cannot hear, cannot speak, who is I?" he adds .
 "I am far, far, what does that mean, no need to be far, perhaps he’s here, in my arms, I don’t feel THE UNNAMABLE 4Q9 any arms on me, if only I could feel something on me" "I know what it is, they must have told me
 I'm in something, it's not I, that's all I know, no more about that, that is to say, make a place, a little world, it will be round . It's not certain, low of ceiling, thick of wall, why low, why thick, I don’t know, it remains to be
 "I must have understood, I must have wanted it, wanted the eye, for my own" "I have tried, all the things they’ve told me, and they come in useful still, when I think of them, that too, you must go on think too"
 Samuel Beckett says the devil showed him everything, in the dark, and how to speak, and what to say, and nature . There are others, even more beautiful .
 "I believe in progress, I believe in silence, ah yes, a few words on the silence, then the little world, that will be enough, for the rest of eternity, you’d think it was I"
 The story was to teach me the naturp of emotion, that’s called emotion, what emotion can do, given favourable conditions, what love can do . It's love, and trains, the nature of trains, and the meaning of your back to the engine .
 "I thought they were over, perhaps it’s a new one, lepping fresh, is it the return to the world of fable, no, just a reminder, to make me regret what I have lost, long to be again"
 At every instant I’m there, listen to me speaking of it, I knew it would come, I emerge from it to speak of it . I speak of the four seasons and the different parts of the day and night, the night has no parts, that’s because you are asleep .
 A score would be plenty, tried and trusty, unforgettable, nicely variecl, that would be palette enough . I’ll laugh, that’s how it will end, in a chuckle, chuck chuck, ow, ha, pa. I'll practise, nyum, hoo, plop, psss
 I’ve drowned, more than once, it wasn’t I, suffocated, set fire to me, thumped on my head with wood and iron . There must be someone, the voice must belong to someone, I've no objection, what it wants I want, I am it .
 "I have nb explanations to offer, none to demand, the comma will come where I’ll drown for good, then the silence, how it drags on" The voice falters and when it stops, but it falters every instant, it stops every instant . When it stops for a good few moments then it must be
 'If only I could give up, before be- ginning, before beginning again, what breathlessness, that’s right, ejaculations, that helps you on, that puts off the fatal hour, no, the reverse, I don’t know, start again, in this immensity, this ob- scurity,
 "I'm alone, perhaps the first, or perhaps the last, talking alone, listening alone" "I won't be the last. I’ll be with the others"
 I launch the voice, I hear a voice, there is nowhere but here, there are not two prisons, it’s my parlour . I wait for my turn, my turn to talk there, my . turn to listen there . My turn to wait there for rtty turn to go there, to be as gone as gone
 "I need walls, good and thick, I need a prison, I was right, for me alone. I'll put me in it. I'm there already"
 There they flre again, to give me quit- tance, waiting for me to say I’m someone . Perhaps that’s all they’re waiting for, perhaps it will be I . But do I really see nothing? How can you not tell a lie, what an idea, a voice like this, tries
 "I'll draw it out of my memory. I'll gather it all about me. I will make myself a place"
 "I’ll make myself a memory, I have only to listen, the voice will tell me everything, tell it to me again, everything I need, in dribs and drabs, breath- less, it’s like a confession, a last confession, then it starts off again"
 'I’m not suffering enough yet, it’s not yet my turn, the topographical and anatomical information in particular is lost on me, I don’t hear everything, that .must be it, the important things escape me,’ he writes .
 "I hear everything, what difference docs it make, the moment it’s not my turn, my turn to understand" "I’ll depart into life, travel the road, find the axe, perhaps it's a cord"
 "I say what I' hear, I hear what I say, I don't know, one or the other, or both, that makes three possibilities, pick your fancy, all these stories about travellers, these stories atjout paralytics, all are mine."
 It's such an old habit, I di\it without heeding, or as if I were somewhere else, there I am far again . It's his turn again now, he who neither speaks nor listens, who has neither body nor soul .
 The words fa ; l, the voice fails, so be it, I know that well. It will be the silence, full of murmurs, distant cries, the usual silence, spent listening, waiting, waiting for the voice, the cries abate, like all cries . I’ll recognise it, in the end I'll recognise
 'I’ve forgotten, it doesn’t matter, I never knew, to have them carry me into my story, the words that remain, my old story, which I've forgotten, far from here' 'Perhaps it’s too late, perhaps they have, how would I know, perhaps it's the door,
 "I'll wake, in the silence, and never sleep again, it will be I, or dream, dream again, dream of a silence, a dream silence, full of murmurs, I don’t know, that’s all words, never wake, all words"
