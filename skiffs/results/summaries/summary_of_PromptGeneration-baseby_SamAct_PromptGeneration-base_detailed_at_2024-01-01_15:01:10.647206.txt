Summary: 
The trial of the so-called "Black Death": volume-dependent authentication of a promissory note for the Bank of England.



Summarizing: Mr. Jervis followed; who stated, that this was an indictment for the crime of forgery, and the prisoner stood charged upon that indictment in different ways:—one charge was, that he had been guilty of forging this note; another, that he had uttered it knowing it to be forged; and these offences were varied in the different counts of the indictment.—The prisoner lived in an old farm house at Perry Barr, which was in the parish of Handsworth, in the county of Stafford, and which house was at a considerable distance from any other dwelling; he also rented land to a considerable extent: his family consisted of himself, his wife, George Scot, three men of the name of Yates, John Barrows, and Elizabeth Chidlow; he had two other persons (servants) of the name of Ingeley, who would be brought forward on the part of the

Summarizing: prosecution. The house of the prisoner being thus privately situated, was well adapted for carrying on a business which required privacy, and he would now proceed to inform them of the precautions taken by the prisoner to prevent that privacy from being disturbed:—On entering the house you find a passage, which communicates with the kitchen and also with the parlour, but the communication with the parlour was secured by three strong doors; the first was a thick strong oak door, with hinges also very strong, fastened by a lock and seven bolts, five of which bolted one way, that is on that part of the door which opens, the other two bolted the other way, namely, at that part of the door to which the hinges were affixed, and this door was further secured by the upper part of it being covered with iron

Summarizing: of considerable thickness; the second door was secured by four strong pieces of wood or wooden bars, going across the whole breadth the door, each being let into the wall by a hole at one end, and the other end falling into a hook or holdfast; the third door was secured by three strong square oak bars, in similar manner to the second; and there was no other communication on the ground floor with that parlour but through these three doors: over that parlour there was a chamber, and over that chamber a garret, and formerly a staircase led out of that passage to these two upper rooms; but when the prisoner's house was searched by the constables from Birmingham, the communication between the staircase and those rooms was stopped, the entrance or door way in both chamber and garret being bricked up, so

Summarizing: that the only way to get into that chamber was through a trap door in the cieling of the parlour, which was fastened down by two iron bars fastened together in the middle, and moving on a pivot, two ends of which were affixed in staples, and the others shut down on hasps, where they could be fastened either by pegs or locks, and these bars when put down formed a × over this trap door; in the cieling of that chamber was another trap door, which was the only way into the garret over, and which was fastened by two bars laid over it transversely, and fastened in a similar manner by staples and hasps; there were moveable ladders by which those of the prisoner's family who wanted to go into those upper rooms ascended to the trap doors, and the ladders were

Summarizing: light, so that they could be easily drawn up after them.—In consequence of suspicions against the prisoner, and that his house contained such implements as were afterwards discovered in it, and that stolen goods were also there, the constables of Birmingham, having obtained a warrant for that purpose, and taking with them several other persons appointed special constables for that occasion, together with a party of dragoons, went to the prisoner's house; for, having been informed that the house of the prisoner was fortified and barricaded in the way that had been described, it was deemed necessary to have such a force as would have rendered resistance on his part unavailing, and therefore this number of constables and soldiers were collected, and on the 16th of March last they proceeded to the prisoner's house, and on the way having (perhaps imprudently) called at a

Summarizing: public-house about a quarter of a mile from the prisoner's (the Boar's Head, at Perry Barr) they were seen by a woman named Dorothy Ingeley, the wife of one of those Ingeleys who were before mentioned as forming part of the family of the prisoner, who having heard or otherwise suspecting the errand on which they were going, made all possible haste to the prisoner's house, and by going a nearer way by the footpath than what the officers did, she arrived there a short time before them, and gave the alarm; this woman would be produced as a witness on behalf of the prosecution, and would prove that when she first got to the house she saw Elizabeth Chidlow, who communicated her intelligence to the prisoner, who was in the parlour, and then came to the woman (Ingeley) and affected to disbelieve the

Summarizing: intelligence; he then returned into the parlour, and slammed the doors to, and fastened them, so as to secure the passage into the parlour, and when the officers of justice arrived they found the parlour inaccessible, the three doors in the passage being secured in the way already described; nor could any entrance be forced through the window, it being fastened by strong oak inside shutters, secured by thick iron bars not more than four inches distant from each other; the windows in the chamber over the parlour were equally inaccessible, being fastened similarly to that in the parlour, and with bars of equal strength; the officers were therefore obliged to place a ladder against the house, so as to ascend to the garret window, and as one of the officers was ascending the ladder he saw the prisoner in the chamber, who was

He locked the doors, and ordered the officers of justice to go up there.



Summarizing: then carrying small pieces of paper resembling bank notes from a bench in the middle of that room, and putting them into the fire, which was in the same chamber; he called out to the prisoner, and asked him to let him in; prisoner replied he would presently; on which the officer again called out to him, telling him he was dropping notes; the officer then ascended to the garret window, and by using a considerable degree of force got in there, and when he had obtained entrance he was soon followed by others; in the garret they found a great variety of engines, and in short every implement necessary for forging coin, in imitation of the

A prisoner with a banknote.



Summarizing: 3s. tokens and dollars issued by the Bank; not one implement necessary for that purpose was wanting; except the dies by which the impression was made, and it could be shewn that the prisoner, fearful of a discovery, and well knowing the consequences which would inevitably attach to those dies being found in his possession, was in the habit of having them buried, or as the cant phrase was, planted, immediately after they had been used; unless the officers arrived at the very moment when he was in the act of coining, those dies could not be found on the house being searched; this was also the case with the coin itself when struck: having seen what

Summarizing: was in the garret, the officers descended through the trap door into the chamber beneath, and they there found every implement necessary for forging bank notes, except the plates, on which the words printed on the notes were engraved, those plates (like the dies) being also planted: they found there charcoal, cokes, a coke fire, a rolling press, or copper-plate printing press, and a stamp for putting on the number of the note; they then descended into the parlour, where they found the prisoner, Elizabeth Chidlow, and James Yates, and having while in the chamber perceived that a considerable quantity of paper had been destroyed by fire, they, after securing the prisoner, re-ascended into the chamber, and

Summarizing: having knocked in a part of the chimney above the fire-place, and put in their hands, they brought out several burnt pieces of paper, and among the rest a note of which part only had been burnt, but of which sufficient remained to shew that it had been a Bank of England promissory note, or rather an imitation of one, and which part would be produced in evidence; the officers then searched other parts of the house, and on going to a room over the dairy, then used as a lumber room, and which room led to another called the granary, they found the door locked, and having forced it open they found in that room every

burnt paper and part of a banknote.



Summarizing: material necessary for fabricating bank paper, upon a beam at some height, and so situated that it could not be seen unless by a tall person standing on a chair, or otherwise raised by some means; they found a mould with wire fastened thereon, and the words ONE near the top, and BANK OF ENGLAND near the bottom, in worked wire, calculated for making the appearance of bank paper, for these wires gave the lines called water marks in the waved manner in which they are made in the real bank notes, and the words so worked appeared in the paper similar to the same words in what are called the water marks in genuine notes; in

Summarizing: another place they found two pieces of pasteboard, on which were pin marks, and to which the paper was fastened for the purpose of receiving the impression of those waved lines; in the next room was found a quantity of pulp, or pulverized rags, with linen and an instrument called a hog, being a machine for working by means of hair brushes the pulp in the tub, to bring it into a proper state to make paper; there was in short every necessary for the purpose of making this sort of paper, and when this part of the evidence was detailed by the witnesses, there would be no doubt but that these materials were employed by the prisoner and his family in making paper of this description, and the prisoner by this indictment was charged with forging a Bank of England note for the sum of 1l, and there would be no question that the evidence to be adduced would shew that by himself, or his associates, the note in question was fabricated. The learned Judge would inform the jury that if the note was by circumstances proved to have been made by his direction, or even with his knowledge, he (the prisoner) would be equally criminal in the eye of the law as if his own hands had formed that note.

Summary: 
The trial of a prisoner for attempting to make paper with a Bank of England note.



Summarizing: Mr. Jervis said he had mentioned that two persons of the name of Ingeley formed part of the family in the house of the prisoner, these persons, either stung by remorse, or for some other reason, had given information which led to a discovery of those plates, which he had before stated were the only implements wanting in the chamber for completing the notes; and though the testimony of persons who had acted as accomplices, and had assisted in the criminal transactions of others who were charged with offences, for which the legislature had inflicted punishment, was always to be received with caution, yet when that testimony was confirmed by credible witnesses, or facts, which would be the case here, they were then entitled to that degree of credit, which the life they had led and the actions they had been guilty of hac deprived them of; in consequence of the discovery made by these persons four plates engraved with the form of a blank bank note which they had planted, were dug up in three different places of a field on which wheat was growing, and which adjoined to the rick yard of the prisoner; two of these plates were in one place, one in another, and one in another; in consequence also of that discovery, a trunk containing several 10l,

Summarizing: several 5l, and about 200 of 1l, bank notes, or forged notes in imitation of bank notes, and some local notes, were found; those local notes were also forged ones, as were also six narrow plates which had engravings on them, the use of which would be explained by the witnesses. It would be shewn that when the alarm was given by

Summarizing: Mrs. Ingeley, the prisoner directed one of the Ingeleys to take that trunk and plant it at a considerable distance from the house, saying the notes in it were done; this was not true in the whole, some of them not being completed, but many of them were, and on one of those notes the present indictment was founded, and it would be for the jury to say if the prisoner was or was not guilty of forging that particular note, for though he was indicted for uttering as well as forging it, yet it was only necessary for the jury in this case to consider that part of the indictment which charged him with the crime of forgery: of the four plates so found one was engraved for making an impression of a 10l, note, one of a 5l, note, and two of 1l, notes, and there was proof that notes had been made from all those plates, and the note partly burnt, which would be produced, would be proved to be made from the plate, of the same paper, and with the same mould, as the note which was the subject of the present indictment; the note so in part, burnt was not filled up or signed, it was what was termed a blank note; the note in question had been filled up, and was signed with the name of J.

Summarizing: Knight. The statement he had made would be proved by the evidence, and it would then be for the jury to say whether the prisoner was guilty or not. The first witness called on behalf of the prosecution was Dorothy Ingeley (examined by Mr. Barnes)—who stated herself to be the wife of Richard Ingeley, and that her husband worked with the prisoner; that on the 16th day of March last she was passing by the Boar's Head public-house, at Perry Barr, and saw some gentlemen and soldiers there; she did not know who they were, but somebody said they were runners going to—[Here the witness was asked if the prisoner was present—she said he was not; she was then told she must not say what she heard when he was absent.]—In consequence of somewhat which she heard she immediately set off for prisoner's house; she went the foot-way, and when she came there she first saw her brother-in-law, John Ingeley, and Elizabeth Chidlow; and Mrs. Chidlow went out of the kitchen, and soon afterwards Booth came to her, and asked her what tale it was that she had brought; she told him she could tell nothing for truth, she had seen some gentlemen and soldiers, but she could not tell if they were coming to his house—she told him where she had seen them; she did not hear what was said by

Summary:

Summarizing: Mrs. Chidlow to Booth; when Booth left her she heard the doors in the passage between the kitchen and parlour shut to, but she did not hear him say any thing did not hear him swear; the gentlemen and soldiers came to the house presently after, the same persons she had seen at the Boar's Head. Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford.—Her husband did not live constantly at Booth's—slept there, or at least slept from home some nights, but never for a week together; he used to come home every night until about a week before Booth was taken up.—[Mr. Clifford was proceeding with other questions, on the subject of her husband sleeping at or from home, but the Court though them irrelevant.] Mr. John Linwood, is one of the Constables of Birmingham, and in consequence of information that had been received, he went to the prisoner's house on Monday the 16th of March last, accompanied by ten special constables and seven dragoons; the party stopt at the Boar's
