 In making it I hardly had to digress from the order in which it is set down in the Gospels, so that there are not more but fewer transpositions of the verses than in most of the concordances known to me . The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters came about of itself from the sense of the teaching .
 True life is life in the present, common to all men and manifesting itself in love . True life unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life . Each two chapters are related as cause and effect .
 In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down without any errors . Each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters .
 In the larger work every deviation from the ordinary version, as well as every inserted comment and every omission, is explained and justified by comparison of the different variants of the Gospels . In the present rendering the following are omitted: the conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, and
 The customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error . Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato, Philo, or Marcus Aurelius did .
 There are many passages in the canonical Gospels just as poor as in the rejected apocryphal ones . It is the teaching of Christ which may be sacred, but certainly not any definite number of verses and syllables .
 The reader should remember that far from it being blameworthy to discard useless passages from the Gospels, it is on the contrary irrational not to do so . I regard Christianity neither as an inclusive divine revelation nor as an historical phenomenon, but as a teaching which gives us the meaning of life .
 "I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this" "I began to study the Christianity which I saw applied in life and to compare that applied Christianity with its source"
 I did not know the light and had thought there was no light of truth to be found in life . But having convinced myself that men live by that light alone, I began to look for its source and found it in the Gospels, despite the false Church interpretations .
 How to name the source of that light, and what materials he or someone else had kindled, did not concern me . I was looking for an answer to the question of life and not to theological or historical questions . What was important to me was this light which has enlightened mankind for eighteen hundred years .
 According to this false interpretation Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations beginning with the commencement of the world and continuing in the Church until now . These false interpreters call Jesus God; but the fact that they recognize him as God does not make them attribute more importance to his words and teaching than the words of the Pentateuch
 "The interpretation of the teaching of one person (and one looked upon as God) should not occasion discord" "If God descended to earth to teach people, his teaching, by the very purpose of his coming, cannot be understood in more than one way"
 The teaching of a great man is only great because it expresses intelligibly and clearly what others have expressed unintelligibly and obscurely . Never, since the time of Arius, has the affirmation of any dogma arisen from any other cause than the desire to condemn a contrary belief as false .
 In the Mohammedan religion it is believed that after Moses and Jesus, Mahomet is the last of the prophets . So that while preaching its own doctrines it attributes their authority to Mahomet .
 Churchmen acknowledging the last revelation explaining all previous ones, should say so and call their religion by the name of whoever received it . But they do not do so, but while preaching doctrines quite alien to Christ's teaching, affirm that their doctrine was taught by Christ .
 The teaching of Christ is not separated on the one side from an artificial and quite unjustifiable amalgamation with the Old Testament, and on the other from the arbitrary additions and perversions made in the name of the Holy Ghost . Only that faith can be called Christian which recognizes the revelation of Christ .
 Renan and Renan are among the most popular interpreters of Jesus' teachings . They try to understand the meaning of his appearance and the spread of his teaching by the events of his life and circumstances of his time .
 Historians of Christianity are so pleased to have understood that Jesus was not God and are so anxious to prove that his teaching is not divine, they strain all their strength to do so . The answer is not to be found in knowledge of the society Jesus was born into, or how he was educated, but only by knowing what this man preached that
 Christ cannot be held responsible for the monstrous tradition that has been interwoven with his teaching . The essential thing is to know in all its purity what constituted that teaching which was so precious to men that they have acknowledged and still acknowledge its preacher to have been God .
 The teaching of Christ as set forth in this book is quite a different teaching from that which he professes . The question for him is whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own meaning .
 The reader is one of those who outwardly profess the Church creed and values it not because he believes it to be true but because to profess and preach it is profitable to him, he is not one of the accusers .
 "Let such readers remember that there is nothing for them to prove, that they have long ago said what they had to say," he says . "Even if they could prove what they wish to, they would only prove what is proved by all the hundreds of opposing Churches," he adds .
 Announcement of welfare by Jesus Christ the Son of God . LEO TOLSTÓY. YÁSNAYA POLYÁNA, 1883. Announcement . of welfare .
 Those who believed that life lies in the xiii. understanding became no longer sons of the flesh, but sons of understanding . Only those who understood the enlightenment were able to become like him .
 When Jesus was twelve years old Mary went once with Joseph for the holiday at Jerusalem and took the boy with her . And the boy grew and matured and was intelligent beyond his years . And after this Jesus lived with his mother and obeyed her in everything .
 John said: Bethink yourselves, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . Called on the people to change their lives and get rid of wickedness . As a sign of a changed life he bathed them in the Jordan .
 Jesus remained in the desert forty days and forty nights without food or drink . Jesus recognized them and said: You are a race of vipers . Then bethink yourselves and change your faith!
 Jesus said to himself: I can disregard the flesh, but I may not throw it off, for I was born by the spirit into the flesh . That was the will of the Father of my spirit, and I cannot oppose him . Then Jesus seemed to see all the kingdoms of the earth and all the peoples, just as they live and labor
 Two of his pupils left their former teacher and went after Jesus . They said: Teacher, we wish to be with you and to know your teaching . He said: Come with me and I will tell you everything. They went with him and stayed with him till ten o'clock . Jesus said to himself: My Father is not flesh but spirit
 Philip was from Bethsaida and a fellow-villager of Peter and Andrew . Jesus called this brother of Andrew's, Peter, which means a stone .
 According to the teaching of the Orthodox, God had given Moses a law that everyone should observe Saturday and do nothing that day . One must not work on Saturday, and one must not eat corn .
 The Orthodox church-elder was angry with Jesus, and said: In the law of God it is said: 'There are six days in the week on which to work'
 Some Orthodox professors of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem . They saw that his pupils, and Jesus himself, ate bread without having washed their hands . These Orthodox began to blame him for that, for they themselves strictly observed how the dishes should be washed .
 You have arranged that anyone may say: 'I give to God what I used to give to my parents', and then he is not bound to feed his father and mother' So by the Church tradition you break the law of God .
 Jesus said: "Do you not understand that what is external, bodily, cannot defile a man? For it does not enter his soul but his belly."
 Jesus said he would destroy the temple and build a new one in three days . The prophet Isaiah said to you: 'The house of God is not the Temple in Jerusalem, but the whole world of God's people'
 Jesus had no need that anyone should give witness of man, for he knew that the spirit is in man . He said to her: If you knew me and knew what I teach you would not say that, but would give me to drink .
 Jesus came to the country of the Jews and lived there with his pupils and taught . At that time John was teaching near Salim, and bathing people in the river Enon, for he had not yet been imprisoned .
 God is a spirit; He cannot be measured and cannot be proved . The Father, loving his son, has entrusted everything to him . He who believes in the son has life, but he who does not believe in the Son has no life .
 If he were really a prophet he would know what sort of a woman it is that is washing his feet: she is a wrong-doer . Jesus said to her: Your wickedness is forgiven .
 The external service of God cannot be combined with the activity of love, says Jesus . He says: Everything depends on what a man considers himself to be .
 To unite my teaching with the old is like tearing a piece from a new garment and sewing it onto an old one . New wine must be put into new wine-skins and then they will both be preserved .
 He said: When you went to John in the wilderness to be baptized, what did you go to see? Orthodox teachers of the law went to see John too, but they did not understand what he was talking about, and considered him of no account . They are like children in the street who chatter to one another and wonder that no one listens
 The law and the prophets were necessary till John came, but now he has announced that the Kingdom of God is on earth . And if anyone tells you: See, it has come, or is coming; or, see, it is here, or there; do not believe them .
 Nicodemus asked: How can a man, born of the flesh and grown up, return to his mother's womb and be conceived afresh? And Jesus answered him: Understand that if man is conceived from heaven there must be something heavenly in him .
 No one has ever gone up to heaven, and we have only man on earth who has come from heaven and is himself of heaven . Not for man's destruction, but for their good, did God implant in man this son of his,
 The Kingdom of God will come for all men at a certain time and in a certain place . The Father of the spirit in man is the Father of those only who acknowledge themselves as his sons . Only those exist to him who have preserved within them what he gave them .
 God has sown the spirit, and the Kingdom of God will be only in those who preserve it . For the spirit there is neither death nor evil for the flesh .
 The farmer is the spirit, the Father; the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the Kingdom of God . When the harvest comes I will tell the reapers to gather the darnel and burn it, but the wheat I will store in the barn .
 "These parables must be understood in two ways: for some like you, my pupils, who understand what the Kingdom of God consists of, and understand how to enter it . Others do not understand this; they look but do not see, they hear and hear, for their hearts have become gross .
 That which was sown on stony ground represents the man who receives the teaching readily and gladly, but has no root and only accepts it for a time . That which is sown among wormwood is he who understands the meaning of the kingdom, but worldly cares and eagerness for riches strangle the meaning in him .
 Once many people came to Jesus to hear his teaching and he went up on a hill and sat down . He began to teach the people what the Father's will is . He said: Blessed are the poor and the homeless for they live in the will of the Father .
 "There will be no release from law till men of themselves fulfil the eternal law completely" "If you are poor only outwardly then, like salt that has no savour, you are good for nothing"
 Everyone who grows angry with his brother-man deserves judgment . Know that God requires neither sacrifice nor prayer, but only peace, concord, and love .
 Do not think that love of a woman is good, do not desire women, but live with her with whom you have become united . Do not swear to any untruth and so profane your God .
 In the former law it was said that if a man killed another he must give a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an arm for an arm, an ox for an ox, a slave for a slave, and much else . But I say to you: Do not fight evil by evil,
 Those who judge and punish are like blind men leading the blind, he says . To entrust one's love of justice to men's courts is like throwing precious pearls to swine . Those who condemn others to violent treatment, wounds, mutilation, or death, wish to correct them .
 All that you wish men to do to you, do you to them . All men are His children, so they are all brothers to you . Make no distinction of nationality, but love foreigners as your own people . Do not fulfil these commandments for praise from men .
 If you wish to pray, do not do it as the hypocrites do . They love to pray in the churches and in the sight of men . They do it for men's praise, and from men receive what they aim at .
 If you suffer want, go about with a cheerful face that men may not see, but that your Father may see and give you what you need . Do not lay up store for yourself on earth. But lay up for yourselves heavenly riches .
 The flowers of the field do no work and do not spin, but they are adorned as Solomon in all his luxury never was . And if God has so adorned the grass which grows to-day, and to-morrow is cut down, will He not clothe you?
 There is only one entry to life—a strait and narrow one . Great and wide is the field around, but it leads to destruction . The Father has prepared the Kingdom for you, but beware of false prophets and teachers .
 The teaching of Jesus was quite different from that of the Orthodox professors of the law . They taught a law that had to be obeyed, but Jesus taught that all men are free . In Jesus Christ were fulfilled the prophecies of Isaiah .
 Jesus rejoiced in the power of the spirit and said: I acknowledge the spirit of the Father, the source of everything in heaven and earth, who has revealed what was hidden from the wise and learned to the simple .
 He who fulfils the will of the Father is always satisfied and knows neither hunger nor thirst . You must not say: 'I will do the . will of God later' Our life is a field God has sown, and our business is to gather its fruits .
 An old man told Jesus that he had been ill for thirty-eight years and was waiting to get into the pool first after the water bubbled, in order to be healed . Jesus said to him: Arouse yourself, take up your bedding and go. and walked away .
 As the Father gives life to the dead so the son give life to him who desires it . The Father has not condemned men to death, but has given them power to die or live at will . If they honour the son as the Father they will live .
 I teach you in the name of the common Father of all men, and you do not accept my teaching, but if someone teaches you in his own name, him you believe . Enter into the meaning of your scriptures, you will find in them the same as in my teaching: commands to live not for yourselves alone but to do good to men
 Jesus spoke a parable, and said that men should not think that the kingdom of heaven is visible . He said that it consists in fulfilment of the Father's will and that that fulfilment depends on each man's efforts .
 Master said to him: Foolish slave! I will judge you by your own words . I put it in a cloth and buried it because I was afraid of you . If you had used my pound the estate would have been added . Master had the pound taken from him who had not used it and given to him who worked much .
 The return of the master and his call for an account is the destruction of the bodily life and the decision of the people's fate . Some, those slaves who fulfil the master's will, use what is given them and greatly increase it .
 Those who don't acknowledge the master's authority do not exist for him: he drives them forth . Those who do not fulfil the will and do not serve life are bereft of what life they had, and are destroyed .
 The true heavenly bread is the spirit of the son of man, which the Father gives you, Jesus said . He who follows him will not hunger, and he who believes in my teaching will never know thirst .
 Jesus said: Do not discuss who I am and where I came from . My teaching is true, not because, like Moses, I declare that God spoke to me on Sinai, but because it exists in you too . The Jews were disturbed at his saying that his teaching had come down from heaven .
 The Jews did not at all understand what he said, and began to dispute as to how it was possible to give one's body for the life of men . And therefore our bodies are truly food for the real .
 Jesus chose seventy men from among those near him, and sent them to places he himself wished to go to . He said to them: Many men do not know the blessing of real life. life .
 Not everyone will believe in my teaching, and those who do not will hate it because it deprives them of what they love . The spirit of the Father in you will tell you what to say, but do not be afraid, endure to the last hour .
 The learned Orthodox gathered at Jerusalem and went to Jesus who was in a village near by . They said that he was possessed of a devil, and that if men lived by his commandments there would be still more evil in the world than now . Jesus called them to him and said: You say that I drive out evil by evil. But no power
 If men were not sons of one spirit it would not be possible to overcome evil . Man must serve the spirit of life and goodness in all men, and not in himself alone . Abuse me as much as you like, but do not decry the commandments of life I have disclosed to you .
 To obtain true life, man must resign the false life of the flesh and live by the spirit .
 Jesus said to one man: Follow me. But the man replied: I have a father who is old; let me bury him and then I will follow you . Another man said: I wish to be your pupil and will fulfil the Father's will . But let me first arrange my family affairs .
 Jesus said to Martha: Martha, Martha! You busy yourself and are anxious about many things, but only one thing is needful . He said: Beware of riches, for your life does not depend on possessing more than others .
 Jesus said to them: You tell me that Pilate slew the Galileans. Were those Galileans any worse than others, that this happened to them? We are all such, and we also shall all perish unless we find salvation from death .
 We can reason and guess what is coming, says Jesus . But if we do not bear fruit we too shall perish, he says . To understand this no wisdom is necessary; everyone can see it for himself .
 Every man who builds a house first sits down and reckons how much it will cost, how much he has, and whether he can finish it . So also he who wishes to live the life of the flesh should first consider how he can finished what he is engaged on .
 You do not practice what you know, not because you doubt, but because you are diverted from the true life by false cares and excuse yourself from it . All men know that the fulfilment of the will of the Father gives life, but they do not accept his invitation because they are drawn away by the guile of riches .
 The Orthodox heard this, and as they loved wealth they ridiculed it . We should give away the transitory and false riches of this life in order to obtain the life of the spirit . It is not possible to serve two masters at once—God and riches: God and riches .
 Even now the Kingdom of God is attainable on earth, and they who enter it are great . And it is not the rich who enter that kingdom, but those who have nothing . God does not look at the exterior, but at the heart .
 Abraham said: Why should I send Lazarus into the fire to you? The rich man said: Still, it would be better if someone were to rise from the dead and go to them, they would then bethink themselves .
 A rich Orthodox official came to Jesus and said: What must I do to obtain everlasting life? Jesus said: Why do you call me good? Only the Father is good. If you wish to have life, fulfil the commandments .
 Jesus said: 'A camel can pass through the eye of a needle sooner than he who trusts in riches fulfil the will of the Father' The pupils were horrified at these words, but Jesus repeated them again .
 Zacchaeus was saying to Jesus: See, Master, what I will do: I will give half my property to the poor . And Jesus said: You have saved yourself. A sacrifice cannot be measured by its size .
 Jesus was saying to his pupils that his death was near, and a woman heard this and was sorry for him, and to show him her love poured oil on his head . She forgot everything, and broke her jar and anointed both his head and his feet . And Judas, who afterwards betrayed Jesus, said: See how much she has
 Jesus said: My teaching is to do the Father's will, and His will can only be fulfilled by deeds, and not by words only .
 Jesus said: You have a special time and place in which to serve God, but for me there is none . I work for God everywhere and always. I show them that their service of God is wrong and that is why they hate me .
 Jesus said: My teaching is not my own, but His that sent me. I teach you the fulfilment of the will of the Father alone . Your written Mosaic law is full of contradictions. Do not judge by externals, but by the spirit .
 Jesus said: You know me, and where I came from in the body, but you do not know where I come from in spirit . You should not judge me but should follow me, he said .
 Many believed his teaching and said: What he says is true, and is of God . Others did not understand him, seeking in prophecies for proof that he was sent from God . Many disputed with him but no one was able to controvert him .
 The Jews asked: Who are you? He said: I am the son of man, acknowledging the spirit as my Father, and what I have understood from him I tell to the world . But the Orthodox said: If I alone say it, still I am right .
 To know truth is to be a son and not a slave, says Jesus . Jesus said: If you err, you will be slaves and will die . If you are in the truth, you are free sons and will live .
 Jesus said: 'I am from the Father of goodness, God: but you are from the father of evil, the devil' He said: "You wish to kill me because I have told you what I have learnt from God"
 Jesus of Galilee said nothing of himself as a man but spoke of the spirit that was within him . He said: I honour the Father and you wish to kill me, which shows that you are not my brothers but sons of another father .
 Jesus saw a man who had no understanding from the time of his birth . He explained to him that he was a son of God in the spirit . The ignorant man was conscious of light .
 The Orthodox asked him how he had come to understand what he had not seen before . They said: You do not understand in a godly way, for Jesus did this on a Saturday, and besides, a layman cannot enlighten people .
 The Orthodox were angry at this, and said: You are altogether sunk in delusions and yet you want to teach us. And they drove him away. He said: Men accept my teaching not because I prove it. It is impossible to prove the truth. The truth itself proves all else .
 Moses: My teaching is to men like the familiar voice of the shepherd to the sheep . A thief only comes to steal, rob, and destroy; the shepherd comes to give life .
 Jesus: "No one will take my life from me, but I myself freely give it up for men to receive true life" The Jews surrounded him and said: What you say is hard to understand and does not agree with our scriptures .
 The Jews were offended at this and took up stones to kill him . But he said to them: I have shown you many good works and disclosed the teaching of my Father . And those who understand my teaching and fulfil it, receive true life .
 Simon Peter said to him: I think your teaching is that you are the chosen son of the God of life . You teach that God is the life within man . Many believed in his teaching and said that it was true as the teaching of John was . Therefore many believed in it .
 Peter asked Jesus: What reward shall we receive for this? Jesus said to him: Everyone who has given up home, sisters, brothers, father, mother, wife, children, or lands, for my teaching, shall receive a hundredfold more .
 When those who had been hired first saw that those hired last received a penny each, they thought they would receive more, but they also were paid a penny . They took it and said: How is it that the others who worked only one shift and we who worked all four shifts receive the same? That is not fair . But the master came
 John and James asked Jesus to make them chiefs among the pupils . Other pupils grew angry with them for wanting to be equal to their teacher . Jesus said: To be more than another you must be the servant of all .
 He told them that they who live according to God's will must not exalt themselves . He said: If you are invited to a dinner, do not seat yourself in a front place, or someone of more importance than you will come .
 The son said: Father, I am to blame before you, and am unworthy to be your son . But the father did not even listen, and said to the servants: Bring the best clothes and the best boots, quickly, and put them on him . And go and catch a fatted calf and kill it, and we will rejoice because
 Master planted a garden, cultivated it, and did everything to make it yield as much fruit as possible . He sent labourers into the garden to work there, pay him for it according to agreement, and gather the fruit . The labourers drove away the master's servant empty .
 People do not like even a reminder of the spirit that lives in them and shows them that it is eternal and that they are not so . To have faith and to receive life it is necessary to understand your position and not expect rewards .
 Faith does not consist in believing something wonderful, but in understanding your position and where salvation lies . Jesus replied: You can readily believe that a great tree grows from a birch seed . If you understand your position you will not expect rewards but will believe in that which has been entrusted to you .
 You should not be anxious to believe that there will be a reward and life, that cannot be otherwise, but be careful not to destroy this life . Do not forget that it is given us that we may bring forth its fruits and fulfil the will of the Father .
 Ten maidens went with lamps to meet a bridegroom . Five of them were wise and five were foolish . The foolish ones took lamps without any extra oil, but the wise ones took a supply of oil .
 By their works men will be separated into two groups, as sheep from goats in a flock . The son of man is always here, he does not belong to some particular time . To serve him one must live without time—in the present alone .
 Those who have not lived by the son of man have not served him, have not understood that he is the same in all men, have lost the life they had in him and have perished .
 We must not despise children. They are better than we, and their hearts are always with the Father . Not one child perishes by the Father's will. They perish only because men entice them and draw them away from the truth . To lead a child away from goodness, to tempt him, is as bad .
 Forgive him always, even if he offends you seven times and seven times asks for forgiveness . If a man has injured you do not forget that he is a son of the same Father and is your brother . If he has offended you go and appeal to his conscience face to face .
 The king called the vassal and said to him: Wretched man, I forgave you all your debt because you begged me to . But the other showed him no mercy and put him in prison, to stay there till he paid everything . So it is with all anger. If you know that anger is an evil thing and separates you
 Some Orthodox teachers once came to Jesus, and trying him, said: May a man put away his wife? He answered: From the very beginning man was created male and female . Therefore a man must not break the natural law of God and divide what is united .
 Beware of temptation against the third commandment: about being forced to fulfil obligations as result of taking oaths . If we are sons of God we are bound to no one but God, and are free from all obligations . If they demand the tax from you, then pay: not that you are under obligation to do so but because you .
 Your Orthodox teachers go about everywhere making people swear and vow that they will fulfil the law . But by this they only pervert people and make them worse than before . In your soul, God is; and you cannot make promises on God's behalf to other men .
 The temptation against the fifth commandment is for men to consider it their duty to do good to their fellow-countrymen only and to regard other nations as enemies . The Orthodox once brought a woman to Jesus and said: See, this woman was taken in adultery. Now by the law she should be stoned to death, but what do you
 Jesus said: The world loves its own but hates God's people. Therefore men of the world will harass those who fulfil the Father's will . I am going to Jerusalem and they will torture and kill me, but my spirit cannot be killed .
 Materialists believed that after the death of the body there is no other life . They said: How can anybody rise from the dead? If everybody rose, they could not live together . Jesus answered them: Either you purposely confuse things or you do not understand what the awakening to life is .
 Those who are dead from among men are alive to God . If God is, and God does not die, then they who are with God live always . The awakening from death is to live in the will of the Father .
 Beware of the self-styled 'Orthodox', for in them is the chief stumbling-block . They tell people to do what cannot be done, and they themselves do nothing . These Orthodox think that people can be brought to God by external ceremonies .
 Self-appointed leaders hide the good and put forward evil in its stead . They are like painted tombs, which seem clean externally but are loathsome within . They outwardly honour the holy martyrs, but in fact they are just the people who torture and kill the saints .
 There is only one true temple of God—the hearts of men when they love one another . People will for a long time be deceived in the name of my teaching, and this will cause wars and rebellions . But when the true teaching spreads abroad among all men, then there will be little love .
 Orthodox chief priests and scholars long consulted together and could not decide what to do with him . One of them, Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, said to them: You must remember that it is expedient to kill one man rather than let the whole people perish .
 Six days before Passover Jesus said to his pupils: Let us go to Jerusalem . But the pupils said to him: Do not go. The chief priests have resolved to stone you to death . Jesus said: I cannot fear anything because I live in the light of understanding .
 In the morning Jesus went to Jerusalem where many people had come for the feast . When they recognized Jesus they surrounded him, tore branches from the trees and threw down their clothes on the road before him . Jesus rode on an ass's foal, and the people ran before him and shouted: He is our true King .
 They feared that the people would be angry with Jesus for not making any difference between the Hebrews and other nations, and they long hesitated about telling him . Afterwards they told him both together, and hearing that the Greeks wished to be his pupils Jesus was troubled .
 He who believes in my teaching believes not in me but in that spirit which gave life to the world . Exalt the son of man means to live by the light of understanding that is in you . From this time that which rules this world shall be destroyed .
 After Jesus had hidden himself, the chief priests and elders gathered together at the palace of Caiaphas . They began to plan how to take Jesus unknown to the people, for they were afraid to take him openly . One of the first twelve pupils of Jesus, Judas Iscariot, came to their council and said: If you
 Jesus said: Go into the village, enter a house, say that you have not had time to prepare for the feast, and ask the man who lives there to admit us to celebrate the Passover . The pupils did this: they asked a man in the village and he invited them in .
 Peter protested and said: Why should you wash my feet? Jesus said to him: It seems strange to you that I should wash your feet, but you will soon know why I do this .
 Peter made a sign to him that he should ask Jesus who the betrayer was . And he did so . Jesus said: I will soak a bit of bread and will give it to him and he to whom I give it is my betrayer . And again the pupils began to look at one another, not knowing of whom he spoke .
 Jesus told his pupils that to-night he would be taken and they would all abandon him and scatter . Peter said he would never deny him, and all the other pupils said the same . Jesus said to them: Formerly neither I nor you lacked anything .
 Jesus went off a little way, lay prone on the ground, and began to pray, saying: My Father, the spirit! Let it be not as I wish, which is that I should not die, but as you wish .
 Peter said to Jesus: Where are you going? And Peter said: You cannot come where I am going now, but later on you will go there too . The personal life is an illusion of the flesh, an evil .
 Jesus said: I cannot show you what will be there; my teaching is the way and the truth and the life . Philip said: But who is the Father? Jesus replied: The Father is He who gives life .
 Jesus said: 'I shall die and worldly men will not see me, but you will see me because my teaching lives and you will live by it' 'He who fulfils my teaching will feel the Father in him and my spirit will live in him'
 If you fulfil my teaching you should rejoice, for instead of having me with you in the flesh, you will have the Father with you . My teaching is a tree of life. He who does not live by my teaching withers and perishes, just as dead branches are cut off and burnt .
 There is no greater love than to sacrifice one's life for others as I have done. You are my equals if you do what I have taught you. If the world hates you, do not be surprised: it hates my teaching. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also .
 If I do not die the spirit of truth will not come to you, but if I die it will abide in you . That spirit will dwell in you, and it will be clear to you what is false, what is true, and how to make decision . The falsity is, that men do not believe in the life of the spirit
 Jesus said to them: Do you not understand what it means—Sometimes you will, and sometimes you will not, hear me? You know how it is in the world: some are sad and grieved while others rejoice . You too will grieve, but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
 Jesus said: Whatever ills may befall you in the world, fear nothing: my teaching will overcome the world . Then the pupils said to Jesus: Now we understand everything and have nothing more to ask .
 I pray to you for those who acknowledge you. They have understood that all they have, their very life, is from you alone . I am no longer of this world, for I am returning to you; but they are in the world .
 Judas appeared with a large throng carrying sticks and swords . Peter snatched a sword from a servant of the high priest and slashed the man's ear . But Jesus rebuked him and said: You must not resist evil . Do not do evil .
 Jesus was taken to the palace of Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year . He said: Why have you come out against me with weapons as if I were a robber? But now is your hour and the power of darkness .
 When Jesus had been taken into the house, Peter also went into the passage with the people . Peter was afraid that he might be accused, and said aloud before all the people: I do not know what you are talking about!
 The Orthodox chief priests tried to accuse Jesus, but at first found no proof on which he could be condemned . Then they found two witnesses who said of him: 'I will destroy this temple of yours made with hands' But this evidence also was not enough to convict him . And so the high priest called Jesus up and said: Why do you
 Pilate the governor came out to them and asked: Of what do you accuse this man? They said: He is an evil doer, so we have brought him to you . Pilate said to them: But if he does you harm, judge him yourselves according to your law .
 Pilate listened to what they had to say, then ordered Jesus to be brought to him to the judgement seat . Pilate said: Do you really think I am a king, or are you only repeating what has been told you?
 Pilate remembered that Galilee was under the jurisdiction of King Herod, and asked: Is he not from Galilee? Pilate began to question Jesus in the presence of the chief priests, but Jesus did not answer . Pilate then said to him: Do you not hear how they accuse you? Why do you not defend yourself? But Jesus
 Pilate sent Jesus to Herod to be judged . Herod regarded Jesus as an empty fellow, and had him dressed in a crimson robe .
 Pilate called up Jesus and asked him: Who are you and where are you from? Pilate said to him: Do you not see that you are in my power and that I can crucify you or set you free? Jesus answered him: You have no power .
 Pilate ordered Jesus first to be scourged and mocked by the chief priests . Pilate said: I am not guilty of the blood of this just man . The people all cried: Let his blood be upon us and on our children! Pilate gave orders that he should be crucified .
 One of the robbers crucified with him said: If you are the Christ, save yourself and us! Jesus said to him: Even now you are blessed with me! He said he was the son of God and that God would not forsake him .
 In his childhood Jesus spoke of God as his 'Father' There was in Judaea at that time a prophet named John, who preached the coming of God on earth . Jesus withdrew into the desert to consider the meaning of man's life .
 Jesus said to himself: I am born as spirit embodied in flesh. Such is the will of my Father and I must not resist His will. But to this he replied: I cannot satisfy the needs of my body, and cannot rid myself of it; but my life is all-powerful. Therefore in my body I should serve the spirit,
 Orthodox Jews worshipped an external God, whom they regarded as creator and ruler of the universe . The keeping of the Sabbath involves a delusion, but good actions should always be done .
 Jesus said that external rules are harmful, and that the church tradition is itself an evil . The spirit is man's consciousness of his sonship to the Infinite Spirit . The true temple is the society of men united in love .
 John is the first prophet to preach to men a Kingdom of God which is not of the external world, but in the soul of man . To do good deeds a man must be conscious of his own faults, says Jesus .
 Every man, though he realizes that he was conceived by a bodily father in his mother's womb, is conscious also that he has within him a spirit that is free, intelligent, and independent of the body . That eternal spirit proceeding from the infinite, is the origin of all and is what we call God .
 The spirit alone gives life to men, and it depends on them to preserve it or lose it . For the spirit, evil does not exist. Evil is an illusion of life .
 To carry out the will of the Father which gives life and welfare to all men, five commandments must be obeyed . The first commandment is to do no ill to anyone so as not to arouse anger, for evil begets evil . The second commandment . is not to go after women and not to desert the wife with whom you
 False teachers can always be detected by the fact that they teach evil in the name of good . It is necessary only to take care to live in the Father's will, and the rest will all be added of itself .
 The teaching of Jesus surprised and attracted the people by the fact that it recognized all men as free . One need not pray to God in any special place, but should serve Him by deeds of love .
 The true food of man is to fulfil the will of the Father-spirit, and this fulfilment is always possible . We should do good to men unceasingly and expect no reward .
 The true life of man can be compared to this: A master apportioned to his slaves a valuable property and told them each to work on what was given him . The portion of the master's valuable property is the spirit of life in man, who is the son of the Father-spirit .
 The true food of man is the spirit of the Father, and to carry out that will of the spirit one must surrender the body . Man lives only by the spirit . Those who love the life of the body will hate you .
 The Orthodox said to Jesus that his teaching, even if it overcame evil, was itself an evil, for those who carry it out must endure sufferings . To this Jesus said: Evil cannot overcome evil. Evil can only be mastered by goodness .
 The death of the body cannot be dreadful to a man who resigns himself to the will of the Father . Family and household cares must not hinder the life of the spirit, says Jesus .
 Death hangs over each of us. Sickness, murder, or accident may at any moment end our life . Most ruinous of all for the life of the spirit is the love of gain, of getting rich .
 To follow the teaching of Christ we must count up the advantages of following our own will and serving the bodily life, and fulfilling the Father's will . Only he who has clearly taken account of this can be a disciple of Christ .
 To fulfil the Father's will it is necessary to sacrifice the bodily life . The bodily life is wealth entrusted to us by another, which we should use so as to gain our own riches .
 A rich man is guilty in that he eats much and luxuriously, while at his door the poor are hungry . Property not shared with others is held in non-fulfilment of the Father's will . A man cannot serve property and God .
 Good cannot be measured; it is impossible to say who has done more or less . A widow who gives away her last farthing gives more than a rich man who gives thousands . A man's whole life must be passed in fulfilment of that will, says Jesus .
 Jesus said: "I teach not something of my own but what comes from the common Father of us all" The Jews did not understand him and looked for external proof of his teaching .
 He who follows my teaching will receive true life. He who fulfils in his soul the Father's will has eternal life . We are enslaved only by the error of taking the life of the body .
 The Jews asked: How can it be that a man will not die, when all those who pleased God most have died? Jesus replied: I speak not by my own authority. I speak of that same source of life that you call God, and that dwells in men . To understand me you must understand that my Father is not the same
 The blind man whose sight has been restored, remaining the same man he was, can only say that he was blind but now sees . And one who formerly did not understand the meaning of life but now does understand it, can also say the same . Demands for proof of the truth of my teaching are as if one demanded from a man who
 Jesus said: My teaching is the awakening of a life till then asleep. He who believes my teaching awakens to eternal life and lives after death . As sheep follow the shepherd who gives them food, so men accept my teaching because it gives life to all .
 The Jews still did not understand and still wanted proofs of whether or not Jesus was the Christ . They said: Do not torment us, but tell us plainly, are you the Christ or not? And to this Jesus replied: Belief must be given not to words but to deeds .
 In the kingdom of heaven there is neither greater nor less, all are equal . According to Jesus no one can be either higher or more important than another . All can fulfil the Father's will, but in doing so no one becomes superior .
 According to my teaching, said Jesus, there can be no superior rank; he who wishes to be better should be the servant of all . My teaching is, that life is given to man not that others may serve him, but that he should give his whole life to the service of others .
 To believe and to act, it is necessary to understand that man can do nothing of himself . If he gives up his bodily life to serve goodness he does nothing that deserves either thanks or reward . We must understand that in doing good a man only does his duty and what he necessarily must .
 To live the true life we must never relax. do not let this life escape them by not fulfilling the Father's will . True life is the fulfilment of the will of the Father, not in the past or in the future, but in the present moment . Only when he understands life in that way can a man have faith enabling him to
 To understand the teaching of Jesus one must understand the life of children and be like them . Children live in the Father's will, not infringing the five commandments . Yielding to temptation ruins men, and therefore everything should be sacrificed .
 To have life we must fulfil the Father's will. We ask forgiveness of Him for failing to fulfil His will, and hope to be forgiven . What then are we doing if we do not ourselves forgive others? We are doing to them what we dread for ourselves .
 Men are tempted to infringe the third commandment by creating, for the advantage of their temporal life, established authorities, and demanding from one another oaths by which they bind themselves to do what those authorities demand . The Father's will is for each man to have one wife and each wife one husband .
 Men are tempted to infringe the fourth commandment by thinking that they can reform others by themselves . Men are called not to judge but to save one another . The one thing they can do is to teach others by an example of purity, forgiveness and love .
 To avoid falling into human illusions we must think not of the physical but the spiritual life . Those who are awake to the true life live in the Father's will for which there is neither space nor time . If they have died for us, they live for God .
 The Orthodox can learn nothing from them but words, and the Father requires deeds . They can teach nothing because they themselves know nothing, and only for their own advantage wish to set themselves up as teachers .
 The Jews saw that the teaching of Jesus would destroy their State religion and their nationality, so they decided to kill him . His innocence and rectitude hindered them, but the high priest Caiaphas devised a pretext for killing him . Jesus was not guilty in any way .
 Jesus went to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover . His pupils entreated him not to go, but he said: What the Orthodox wish to do to me, and all that any man may do, cannot alter the truth for me .
 Jesus was troubled when certain heathen wished to discuss his teaching . He knew that his talk with the heathen would make clear his rejection of the whole Jewish law . He also knew that to do this would cost him his bodily life but its loss would give men a true understanding of life .
 Jesus declared openly what he had only said privately to Nicodemus . He said: Men's lives, with their different creeds and governments, must all be changed . All human authorities must disappear .
 Many unofficial folk believed Jesus; but the notables and official classes did not believe him . They saw that he turned the people from them and they wished to kill him . One of his twelve pupils, Judas Iscariot, came to them, and they bribed him to take their emissaries to Jesus when he should .
 Jesus said he fed him and given him drink and washed his feet . He said: I have done this to show you how to behave to those who harm you . To exalt the son of man is to be as kind as the Father to all men .
 Jesus told the pupils to get weapons to defend themselves . The pupils replied that they had two knives . Jesus said: Do not consider the body, but try to exalt the spirit in yourselves .
 Peter stopped him and asked where he was going . Jesus replied: I am going where you cannot go . Peter said: A man cannot pledge himself to anything .
 My teaching is that man should live in the will of the Father and fulfil His will for the life and welfare of all men . The only true life is that which recognizes the Father's will as the source of life .
 The teaching of the world is that men should do evil to one another, but my teaching is that they should love one another . Therefore the world will hate you as it has hated me, but you must affirm the truth . Love is to sacrifice the bodily life for the sake of another: there is no other definition .
 When I am no longer with you in the bodily life, my spirit will be with you . Like all men you will not always feel within you the strength of the spirit . Hours of bondage to the flesh will come upon you, but only for a time .
 Peter rushed to defend him and, drawing a knife, began to fight . But Jesus stopped him and told him to give up the knife, saying that he who fights with a knife himself perishes .
 Peter, who had just assured Jesus that he would rather die than renounce him, now when he saw Jesus being led to execution was afraid they would execute him too . Only later, when the cock crowed, did Peter understand that there are two temptations of the flesh—fear and strife .
 Jesus had not yielded either to the temptation to fight when the pupils had two knives ready for his defence, or to the temptations of fear . Jesus did not reply, but said: "I have concealed nothing and conceal nothing now"
 Pilate called Jesus before him, and asked: What is the meaning of this—are you King of the Jews? Pilate said: Do you really wish to know what my kingdom is? The high priest was glad to hear these words and said to the other judges: Are not these words enough to condemn him? And the judges said:
 Pilate asked Jesus why do they call himself a king? Jesus replied: They say truly that I call myself a king, but my kingdom is not an earthly one, it is a heavenly one . Pilate said: You teach the truth, but nobody knows what truth is .
 Pilate tried to persuade them to let Jesus go, but the priests and the people cried out that he must be executed . But they held to their demand, and they all cried out to have Jesus crucified .
