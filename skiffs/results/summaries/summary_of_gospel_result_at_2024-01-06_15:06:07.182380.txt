To extract the main idea from a text, you would need to follow the order in which it is set down in the Gospels. This means that there are fewer transpositions of verses than in most concordances known to you. The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters came about of itself from the sense of the teaching, which was to present the life and teachings of Jesus in a chronological order. This approach allows for a more coherent and meaningful reading of the text, as it allows for a more focused and intentional reading of the Gospel.

The text "True Life is Life in the Present, Common to All Men, and Unites with the Father, the Source and Foundation of Life" is a short summary of a longer work, which is a book called "The Life of Christ" by John Chrysostom. The book is a collection of sermons and homilies written by Chrysostom, a bishop and theologian in the Byzantine Empire. The main idea of the book is that true life is life in the present, common to all men, and unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life. The two chapters that are related as cause and effect are chapter 11 (on the resurrection) and chapter 12 (on

In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down without any errors. Each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters. This means that the author has carefully selected and arranged the material from the Gospels in a way that reflects the overall structure and message of the biblical narrative. The prayer is a meditation on the life and teachings of Jesus, and it is designed to help readers understand and appreciate the significance of each chapter. By following the prayer's structure and themes, readers can gain a deeper understanding of the Gospels as a whole and of the life and teachings of Jesus.

In the larger work, every deviation from the ordinary version, as well as every inserted comment and every omission, is explained and justified by comparison of the different variants of the Gospels. The following are omitted in the present rendering:

1. The conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, and the birth of Jesus' mother. These events are not included in the larger work because they are not found in the original Gospels.

2. The Gospel of John, which is not included in the larger work

The customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error. Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato, Philo, or Marcus Aurelius did. The Gospels are the accounts of Jesus' life, ministry, and teachings, written by eyewitnesses who were present at the events they describe. They are not works of fiction or propaganda, but are based on the firsthand accounts of the people who knew Jesus. The Gospels are considered sacred because they contain the words and deeds of Jesus, which are believed to have been divinely inspired and to have been preserved for us by the Holy Spirit.

Yes, there are many passages in the canonical Gospels that are just as poor as the rejected apocryphal ones. This is because the Gospels are not considered to be sacred texts, and their teachings are not considered to be infallible. The Gospels are considered to be historical accounts of Jesus' life and teachings, and their accuracy and reliability are subject to debate and interpretation. While some passages may be considered more important or significant than others, the overall message and teachings of Jesus are considered to be of utmost importance and should not be compromised or distorted.

To extract the main idea from a text, you should first identify the central theme or message of the passage. This can be done by focusing on the key words, phrases, or sentences that convey the main idea. For example, if the passage is about the resurrection of Jesus, you might focus on the phrase "from the dead" or "resurrection" to identify the central theme.

Once you have identified the main idea, you can then focus on the supporting evidence or arguments that support it. This can include quotes, paraphrases, and other literary devices that support the central idea. For example, if the

The text "I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this" "I began to study the Christianity which I saw applied in life and to compare that applied Christianity with its source" refers to the author's personal journey towards Christianity. The author begins by stating that they were led to Christianity by "this" (the Bible), which they saw applied in their life. They then compare this Christianity to its source, which is the Bible. The text highlights the author's personal journey towards Christianity, which is not based on theological or historical investigations.

Your goal is to extract the main idea from a text. 

Your always return only edited and short summary of the text.

In this case, your goal is to extract the main idea of the text "The Light and the Darkness" by William Shakespeare. The text discusses the contrast between light and darkness, and the author uses this contrast to explore the nature of human existence and the search for truth.

The main idea of the text is that there is no absolute truth, and that men live by the light they find in the Gospels, despite the false interpretations of the Church. This idea is conveyed through the contrast between the light of Christ and the darkness of the false

To name the source of that light, you could refer to the author's statement that it was "kindled" by someone else. This would suggest that the light was not created by God or any other divine being, but rather by a human being or group of humans. Alternatively, you could refer to the light as "the light," which would be a generic term for any source of illumination or guidance.

As for the materials used to kindle the light, this would depend on the specific context in which the light was first described. In the context of the Bible, the light is often associated with the burning bush in the desert, which was

According to the false interpretation, Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations that began with the commencement of the world and continued in the Church until now. These false interpreters do not attribute more importance to Christ's words and teaching than the words of the Pentateuch, which are considered to be the first five books of the Bible. The false interpretation suggests that Christ's teaching is not as important as the teachings of the Old Testament, which are considered to be the foundation of Christianity. This false interpretation is a form of anti-Christian propaganda that seeks to

The first sentence of the text is a quote from the book of Hebrews, which is a letter written by the apostle Paul to the Hebrews, a Jewish community in the Roman Empire. The quote emphasizes the importance of understanding the teaching of one person (God) in a single way, as it cannot be understood in more than one way. This quote is a reflection of the Christian belief that God's teachings are not subject to interpretation, and that his message is unchanging and universal.

The second sentence of the text, "If God descended to earth to teach people, his teaching, by the very purpose of his coming, cannot be understood in more than one way," is

The teaching of a great man is only great because it expresses intelligibly and clearly what others have expressed unintelligibly and obscurely. This is because great thinkers have always been motivated by a desire to condemn a contrary belief as false, rather than by any other cause. This is evident in the works of philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates, who were all known for their ability to explain complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. Their teachings have had a profound impact on Western culture, inspiring generations of thinkers and influencing the development of various fields, from science to politics

 The Mohammedan religion, also known as Islam, believes that after the prophets Moses and Jesus, Muhammad is the last of the prophets. This belief is reflected in the text, where it attributes the authority of its own doctrines to Muhammad. This is evident in the statement "So that while preaching its own doctrines it attributes their authority to Mahomet." The use of the word "Mahomet" here suggests that the religion is claiming to be the last and most authoritative of all prophets. This is further reinforced by the fact that the religion attributes its own doctrines to Muhammad, which is a common practice in Islamic theology.

 The given text is a response to a question about the use of the term "Churchmen" in a religious context. The author is responding to the question by stating that churchmen acknowledging the last revelation explaining all previous ones should call their religion by the name of whoever received it, but instead, they do not do so. The author suggests that while preaching doctrines, they affirm that their own doctrine is not Christ's teaching, but rather alien to it. The author's response highlights the tension between theological and doctrinal differences within a particular religious community, and the need for clarity and consistency in religious discourse

 The teaching of Christ is not separated from the Old Testament and the additions and perversions made in the name of the Holy Ghost in the teaching of Christ. This is a common misconception that has arisen due to the historical context in which the Bible was written.

The Old Testament is a collection of books that were written by various authors over a period of several centuries. These books contain the stories of the Israelites' history, law, and prophets. The Old Testament is not a separate entity from the New Testament, but rather it is a part of the same canon of scripture.

The New Testament, on the other hand, is a

Renan and Renan are two renowned interpreters of Jesus' teachings who aim to understand the meaning of his appearance and the spread of his teaching by the events of his life and circumstances of his time. They are among the most popular interpreters of Jesus' teachings, and their work has been widely recognized and appreciated by scholars and the general public alike.

Renan's approach to understanding Jesus' teachings is based on his interpretation of the Gospel accounts, which he sees as a historical record of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. He believes that the Gospel accounts provide a comprehensive and accurate account of Jesus' teachings and the events that shaped his life and ministry.



Historians of Christianity are not pleased to have understood that Jesus was not God, as they are anxious to prove that his teaching is not divine. This is because they have strained all their strength to find a way to prove that his teaching is not divine. The answer to this question is not to be found in knowledge of the society Jesus was born into or how he was educated, but only by knowing what Jesus preached. This is because Jesus' teachings are the foundation of Christianity, and any attempt to disprove them is a disservice to the faith.

 The given text is a summary of a passage from the book "The Life and Morals of Jesus Christ" by John Newton. The passage discusses the importance of Christ's teaching and its impact on the world. The author argues that Christ cannot be held responsible for the monstrous tradition that has been interwoven with his teaching, as it was precious to men and they have acknowledged his preacher to be God. The passage emphasizes the essential nature of Christ's teaching and its relevance to the world today.

 The teaching of Christ as set forth in this book is a different teaching from that which he professes. The question for Christ is whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own meaning. This is a different teaching from the one that Christ professes, as he has already stated that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and the Savior of the world. Therefore, the question for Christ is whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own meaning.

The reader is one of those who outwardly profess the Church creed and values it not because they believe it to be true but because it is profitable to them. This reader is not one of the accusers, who are those who accuse others of heresy or who seek to discredit the Church. Instead, they are those who profess the Church's teachings out of a desire to benefit themselves or others. The reader is not a member of the Church, but they are a witness to its teachings and values. They are not a member of the Church because they believe it to be true, but because they believe it to be profitable.

The quote from the book "The Church of England and the Church of Scotland" by John Henry Newman is about the importance of not proving one's own beliefs or opinions. The author argues that even if one were to prove their beliefs, they would only be proving what is already known and accepted by other Churches. This quote emphasizes the idea that one should not seek to prove their own beliefs or opinions, but rather focus on the truth and the evidence that supports them.

In the year 1883, the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy published his novel "Yasna Polyana," which is a collection of short stories about the life of a peasant family. The novel is known for its focus on the spiritual and moral values of the Russian Orthodox Church, and its exploration of the themes of love, sacrifice, and redemption.

The novel is divided into three parts, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the family's life. The first part, "The Cossack," tells the story of a young peasant boy named Ivan who is sent to the Cossack army to fight against the Turks. The second part, "The Pe

The passage I provided is from the novel "The Enlightenment" by J.R.R. Tolkien. The main idea of the passage is that only those who understand the concept of enlightenment can become like it. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding and embodying the ideals of enlightenment, which are based on reason, logic, and critical thinking. The passage suggests that those who do not understand these concepts are not capable of becoming like the enlightened, and that only those who do can become truly enlightened. The novel explores the themes of human nature, the nature of knowledge, and the quest for understanding.

The passage is about Mary's visit to Jerusalem with her husband Joseph and their son Jesus at the age of twelve. The passage describes how Mary took Jesus with her on this trip and how he grew and matured. It also mentions that Jesus lived with his mother and obeyed her in everything. The passage ends with Jesus living with his mother and obeying her in everything.

John's message to the people of his time was to repent and change their lives, as a sign of a changed life, he bathed them in the Jordan River. This was a significant event in the history of the region, as it marked the beginning of the Messianic era, which was prophesied in the Old Testament. The message of John's baptism was that the Kingdom of God was at hand, and that those who repented and changed their lives would be welcomed into the Kingdom. This message was a call to action for the people of his time, and it remains relevant today as a reminder of the importance of repentance and transformation in our lives.

The passage above is a paraphrase of the text material. The original text is: "Jesus remained in the desert forty days and forty nights without food or drink. Jesus recognized them and said: You are a race of vipers. Then bethink yourselves and change your faith!"

The main idea of the passage is that Jesus recognized the people who came to Him and said that they were a race of vipers. This recognition is seen as a sign of Jesus' compassion and mercy towards them. Jesus then challenges their faith by saying that they are a race of vipers, which implies that they are untrustworthy and deceitful. This challenge is seen as a call to repentance and a

Jesus' statement "I can disregard the flesh, but I may not throw it off, for I was born by the spirit into the flesh" implies that he is not willing to give up his human nature, which is a part of his divine nature. This statement highlights Jesus' understanding of his identity as a human being and his commitment to living a life of service and sacrifice for the sake of others.

The phrase "for I was born by the spirit into the flesh" emphasizes Jesus' connection to the divine and his willingness to embrace the limitations and challenges of human existence

The text describes two of Jesus' pupils who left their former teacher and went after him, hoping to learn from him. They said that they wished to be with him and to know his teaching, but Jesus told them to stay with him until ten o'clock. This suggests that the two pupils were persistent and eager to learn from Jesus, even after he had left his previous teacher. The fact that Jesus told them to stay with him until ten o'clock suggests that he believed they would be able to benefit from his teachings and that he wanted to give them the opportunity to ask him questions. Overall, the text highlights the

In the given text, the main idea is to extract the main idea from the text, which is the name of a brother of Andrew's named Peter. The text mentions that Jesus called this brother of Andrew's, Peter, which means a stone.

 According to the Orthodox teaching, God gave Moses a law that everyone should observe Saturday and do nothing that day. This law is known as the Sabbath or Shabbat, and it is considered a holy day in the Orthodox faith. The Orthodox believe that the Sabbath is a time for rest, reflection, and spiritual renewal, and that it is a reminder of God's creation and the importance of His creation.

The Orthodox also believe that the Sabbath is a time for doing no work or business on that day. This means that people should not work on Saturday, and they should not engage in any activities that require physical labor or manual labor. This includes things like farming, construction, and manufacturing.

In

The Orthodox church-elder was angry with Jesus because Jesus had said that in the law of God, it is said: "There are six days in the week on which to work." The Orthodox church-elder interpreted this verse to mean that only six days out of seven are considered work days, and that Jesus was contradicting the law. The Orthodox church-elder believed that Jesus was breaking the law by saying that there are six days in the week on which to work, and that this was a serious offense.

The text is a piece of religious literature, written by an Orthodox professor of the law, who is discussing the behavior of Jesus's pupils and Jesus himself, who were eating bread without washing their hands. The Orthodox professors are blaming Jesus for this, as they themselves strictly observe how dishes should be washed. The text is a commentary on the behavior of Jesus's followers, and the Orthodox professors' criticism of it. The main idea of the text is the importance of proper hygiene and cleanliness in religious practices.

Yes, you are correct. The Church tradition that you refer to is the one that states that anyone who gives to God what they used to give to their parents is not bound to feed their father and mother. This tradition is based on the idea that God is the ultimate source of all goodness and that giving to Him is the best way to show gratitude and love towards Him.

The Church tradition is not a law, but rather a tradition that has been passed down through the centuries and is considered to be a part of the Christian faith. It is not binding on anyone, as it is based on the belief that God is the ultimate source of all goodness and that giving to Him is the best way to show gratitude and love towards Him

The given text is a quote from the Gospel of Matthew, which states that Jesus' statement "Do you not understand that what is external, bodily, cannot defile a man?" does not refer to the body but to the belly. The quote is not directly related to the main idea of the text, which is Jesus' teaching about the importance of living a righteous life.

The main idea of the text is that Jesus' statement that he would destroy the Temple and build a new one in three days is not the Temple in Jerusalem, but the entire world of God's people. This is evident from the prophet Isaiah's statement that the Temple in Jerusalem is not the whole world of God's people. The text emphasizes that the Temple is not the physical structure, but the people who are part of God's covenant community.

 The given text is a part of the Gospel of John, which is a part of the New Testament. The passage is about Jesus' encounter with a woman who is seeking to know him and his teachings. Jesus tells her that she does not need to testify of him, as he already knows that she is a sincere follower of him. He also tells her that she should not say that she knows him, as it would be a lie. This passage highlights Jesus' humility and his desire to be known only by his teachings and his love for his followers.

 The given text is a summary of the passage "Jesus came to the country of the Jews and lived there with his pupils and taught" from the book of John. The passage describes Jesus' arrival in the country of the Jews, where he taught and taught near Salim, and near the river Enon. The passage also mentions John, who was teaching near Salim and bathing people in the river Enon. The summary provided in the text is a condensed version of the entire passage, highlighting the main idea of Jesus' arrival in the country of the Jews and his teachings.

The main idea of this text is that God is a spirit and cannot be measured or proven. The author believes that the Father, loving his son, has entrusted everything to him, including life. This belief is supported by the fact that believers have life through the Son, who is the only way to God. The text emphasizes the importance of faith in believing in the Son and receiving life through him.

The given text is a paraphrase of a section from the Gospel of John, which describes the moment when Jesus washes the feet of his disciples. The original text reads: "Jesus said to them: 'If I, then, the one who cleanses you, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. For I tell you that my Father will love

 The external service of God cannot be combined with the activity of love, according to Jesus, as he says: Everything depends on what a man considers himself to be. This means that the two cannot be combined, as love is not a function of the external service of God. This is a clear statement from Jesus, who emphasizes the importance of separating the two concepts.

 The given text is a quote from the book "The Art of Teaching" by Rudolf Steiner, which is a collection of essays and lectures on education and spirituality. The quote is about the process of unifying teaching with the new, which involves putting new wine into old wine-skins and then preserving it. The quote emphasizes the importance of integrating new ideas and practices into existing ones, rather than trying to replace or eliminate them. It suggests that by combining old and new, we can create a more cohesive and effective teaching approach.

The text is a quote from the Gospel of John, where Jesus tells the story of John the Baptist's baptism. In this context, the phrase "when you went to John in the wilderness to be baptized" refers to the journey that Jesus and his disciples took to John's baptismal site, where they were instructed to be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The phrase "what did you go to see?" refers to the purpose of the journey, which was to be baptized in the name of Jesus. The quote

The law and the prophets were necessary until John came, but now John has announced that the Kingdom of God is on earth. This is a significant shift in the religious and political landscape of the region, and it is noteworthy that John does not believe in the existence of the law or the prophets. This suggests that John's message is not based on the authority of the Old Testament, but rather on the teachings of Jesus and the early Christian community. This shift in the religious and political landscape is significant because it challenges the traditional view of the relationship between the law and the prophets, and suggests that the Kingdom of God is not limited to a specific time or place.

The text also emphasizes the importance of recognizing oneself as a son of the Father of spirits in man and preserving what he has given.

 The main idea of this text is that God has created a spirit that is immortal and free from death and evil. This spirit is not limited by the physical body, and it can exist independently of the flesh. This idea is central to the Christian belief in the resurrection of the body and the eternal life that follows. The text emphasizes the importance of preserving this spirit, which is the source of life and salvation, and emphasizes the need to avoid the physical and worldly temptations that can lead to death and evil.
