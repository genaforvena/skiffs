Once lying. Now standing. That a body? Yes. Say for be said. From now say for missaid. Say a body where none. No mind. Where none.

The words too whosesoever. How almost true they sometimes almost ring! How wanting in inanity! Say the night is young alas and take heart. "How try say? How try fail? No try no fail. Say only-- First the bones."

In the skull the skull alone to be seen. By the staring eyes. The others gone. Long sudden gone. Then sudden back. Unchanged Unchanged.

Said is missaid Whenever said said said missaid. From now said alone. No more from now now said andnow missaid from now on.

Stare outstared away to old man hindtrunk unreceding on. Stare away to child and worsen same. Vast void apart old man and child.
