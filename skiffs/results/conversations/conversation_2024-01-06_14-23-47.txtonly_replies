are able to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. These roots are often buried deep in the soil with the roots emerging into the air. Their shape is very unique in comparison to most other trees. The roots are often branched
can reach depths of 5 meters or more. Their thickness varies depending on the tree species. For example, a redwood tree may have roots that reach 15 meters while a linden tree may have roots that only reach a
few meters. The thickness of the root system can vary from one plant to the other. However, for the most part, it is pretty much uniform. The roots have two kinds of structure. They have thickening to hold the tree upr

2. Twigs: The twigs of a tree are made up of small, flat branches that are attached to the
branches of the trunk. The shape and size of the twigs can vary greatly depending on the tree. They can be straight, twisted, or curved, and they can be a bright green or a rich brown color. The shape of
