An early version of the characters is a group of three people, each with their own individual and unique characteristics. However, there is one person in the group that has characteristics of the character they
 They have children in different forms. Some of them can tell about certain things, but they have never spoken to each other. What do you think of the way this relates to the other characters?

But, I've had other things in mind...
1. I want to get a sense of the story as a whole.
2. I'm thinking in
