"There are other guys that got an opportunity with him, and it all worked out," Thompson said. "He was just playing with his feet, just got stronger and stronger. I don't care who you're talking about, he's

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  And then we were done. Sheila got married and our lives changed. So did ours. But she wanted more. More responsibilities and more of a family.
Now we only had one room and I was tired of it. I was going to

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It was going to be a hard few weeks for him.
My last project in the city was going to be a bit of a disaster. It had been a great four-day weekend. But then, one thing led to another and the next

gpt2: 
It's a simple workout. I get up at 4 a.m., throw in my workout shorts and some other stuff, walk, sit, sit down to my feet and work out.
We hit it off with the same movements that we

gpt2:  "I'll walk, and we'll sprint, and then I'll walk." He says as I do so.
This is great. He'll run the hill on a downhill running in a little bit. It's almost like you're in the

gpt2:  In a year, he will probably just get a lot of fitness, because he won't have time to cook and when he looks back, he'll tell me about his experience. But there are some things he could do to keep up, so he

gpt2: 

"If somebody else is going to get to that level or what is happening now, there's no doubt he can play. The young players are very big guys, they're still young.

"I just don't know if there
2023-12-29 17:39:57
gpt2:  And then I'll see. And I will feel.
That was when I put together the project. He will probably always look back at me and say, 'Now I have a name, can you name that name?' And I will say,
2023-12-29 17:40:02
gpt2:  That's pretty neat."

Thompson, who joined the Bulls after the 2010-11 season, made just 19 of 30 field goals, which was his lowest overall mark for a Bulls rookie last season. While he was also considered among the top four
2023-12-29 17:40:49
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It's amazing. I follow his lead as he continues to run the hill. At one point I'm thinking maybe I should make a dash. Then I realize I'm running with one arm behind the shoulder. That doesn't sound too good, but
2023-12-29 17:41:32
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm trying to beat myself as I watch the guys from work, try to ignore the way they've been working out as I've gone about my daily routine. It's an hour later when I'm standing up and sweating all over as I stand
2023-12-29 17:41:41
gpt2: 

The first thing we'll have to do is build in the gym. I want to stay at the local fitness center. I'm already in that gym. My son loves the gym, too. He's always on the run in the gym
2023-12-29 17:41:46
gpt2:  My brother is a huge athlete and I work out every single day at a gym. We want to be able to just eat, drink and play.

We also have a special project that I'm working on and it's called the Brawn
2023-12-29 17:41:52
gpt2:  This has the same results as

lifting weights because they have so much more stamina. When people use the press bar, we throw in that

strategic idea that every movement means something.

It's an exercise like barbell swings
2023-12-29 17:42:42
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

I grab the weights and shake them before starting the slow and easy one. I look down at myself as I lift one more before I lean over and start the next one.

I put the one over my head and start the machine

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "

"True but the younger players have a hard time believing they are big guys but they do. They do have the stamina and the ability to fight back.

gpt2:  Even though I don't have a lot of confidence in myself because of my body, I know I can be strong at times."

Keegan is looking forward to fighting with other players to help the team.

"To me being
2023-12-29 17:44:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The bigger the guy the harder they say and no one is ready for that. The size of our jock doesn't matter, all that matters is being the biggest guy they can. I wouldn't worry about this though.

At that point
2023-12-29 17:45:14
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I just have to keep taking it and if it scares me it's not like I can stop.

I do the press and then the long one. Then the light on the long and then the speed up and then the slow one again.
2023-12-29 17:45:22
gpt2:  I love it so far.

There's definitely an element of the Brawn theme that we're trying to avoid, which is that if you're a hardcore swimmer, you're not really interested in learning anything about other guys.


2023-12-29 17:46:04
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It feels wonderful. Then I have the two of the three down one step at a time. The ones coming up the other two.

It feels like the next step is coming up but I can't seem to stop. I could feel my

gpt2:  The game doesn't need to go on with me but that's my belief. Every player who gets in the end game is a big factor in my success."
2023-12-29 17:47:02
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I still am trying to follow the rules. My two friends now have the girls down one step at a time. I feel a bit of nervousness. They look down and I can see the red outline of a cock under them.

 After the first 20 minutes or so I decided to head home.<|endoftext|>
2023-12-29 17:48:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I went right. So I opened the front door and when I came into the house I didn't see that any of the women were there. Just the three of them.

"Hey, is that one of the new ones?" I said
2023-12-29 17:49:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It was pretty late, my boss would probably be asleep by the time I walked home.

"Hi!" I said as I came to a halt.

"Hi, you didn't see that one?" a voice from inside said.
2023-12-29 17:49:27
gpt2: 


That's my story. And I like the stories and I've always really loved talking about it. That is my way of putting it. I hope you'll want to read the rest.

I can't give you the "what

gpt2:  He heard me and came back in. I'd never heard him say that in my life. So I said I'd just go find them and we'd go find the two of them, you know? And she looked at me like, oh,
2023-12-29 17:49:38
gpt2:  "I'm not going to lie, this is amazing. It will last forever. This is the best I've ever had!"

And you know, he probably wouldn't know the name, but he's a young and exciting man.

2023-12-29 17:50:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Hey, you okay?"
"Yeah," I nodded.
"What are you watching?" He had me turn around and look into the corner of the room. "My girlfriend is giving the show on this couch."
He picked me
2023-12-29 17:51:08
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That's why I'm coming home."
"I'll be fine thanks. It's only a few weeks though so we can't go crazy all the time."
"Ok, thanks for coming."
"Anytime. Have a good weekend
2023-12-29 17:51:16
gpt2:  I'm not a really nice guy. But I get it. I have issues with my friends. I'm gonna fix them. I guess I don't have that type of attitude like I did with the other girls. I'm a tough guy to
2023-12-29 17:51:21
gpt2: 

But I'm a good, honest person. I'd like to be able to explain everything to you and help you with any questions you might have. In fact, if I had a chance to take your question to your boss, I would
2023-12-29 17:52:10
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Maybe we could do this together. Maybe we could even be like the two of us from the movies.

Okay, so I know I look stupid. So how do I get you to talk to me about all of this? If I were
2023-12-29 17:53:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Maybe I'll show you how to make an awesome salad."
"You'd like that?" I say.
"Yes, I'd love to."
"You won't tell Dad?" she says.
"Oh, he's a gentleman
2023-12-29 17:53:47
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Who are you?" I said again, trying to keep my voice low, "What's going on?"
"My friend, Julie. She wanted to talk to you." She held her arm out to me. "I didn't have

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Why is this place so different than what you grew up in?"

I do. She's an old one, old age. They never met, she has always told me. How you can be an old man without

"I'm not sure..." he chuckled. "I'm still a kid. But a little something to give myself a

My son gets down onto his knees to hold up the tray and sits down with a small salad on top of him.
I'm sitting on the table with Dad and the four other girls on top of

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm starving."
"Food?"
She reached up and cupped my face, then ran her hand over my jaw. "Don't be silly." She leaned in and gently kissed me, her tongue teasing my lips. "I'm so
2023-12-29 17:56:47
gpt2:  My son has a salad, and we're both in a row eating it.
"Can I take a look?"
Dad shakes his head.
"Sure," I reply. He smiles at me. "I have to tell you why.
2023-12-29 17:56:54
gpt2:  He's very happy. I can give a lot of advice to him.

He'll ask, "Why don't I get some water or something? That makes my day feel much more productive." It's more fun for you to get to
2023-12-29 17:57:43
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm sorry you missed my brother's wedding. I had to drag him back, and they were really trying to get me to the wedding, but I have to go, too."
"You're not taking him?" I asked, the truth
2023-12-29 17:58:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It's here."

"You're a fucking genius!"

"I'm still a bit of a joker. Anyway, I can explain later." She said.

"No, but at least I could try the bathroom."
2023-12-29 17:59:16
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I know he is in the back of a car and will soon drive us home. I'll try to make up for it next month."
"You can do better than that," I said, laughing as she blushed and left to take her
2023-12-29 18:00:05
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"No, actually, I thought about it, but he was my age and couldn't go. So I thought that I would only pick him up. He is only my sister's age."
"How old are you?" I asked.
2023-12-29 18:00:55
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "

He picks up his shirt off the floor and drops it behind me. I drop my shorts and pull my cock out. "What's up?"

He is getting into a conversation now. "Would you like a drink?" I

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "Dude, you just left here without even picking up your plate," he says.
"I could have gone anywhere, and they had enough meat and beer to make any room," I say with an incredulous tone.
She bites into
2023-12-29 18:01:55
gpt2:  I winced at his face, and the shirt I'm wearing is not exactly a long one, but it has at least two-thirds of the letters on it. He looks around and turns to me, "Don't think so, you're

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

"Yeah. Let me just grab my wallet and wallet and we can head inside."

"Do you have any beer left?"

"I do. Thanks" He looks back over his shoulder, I feel like I've turned

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I mean, okay, the shirt is sort of cute, but, you know... It's not for sex, I swear to god. It's for... it's for... well, for some stupid reason. Anyway, he's gonna think

2023-12-29 18:04:25
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "I nod my head." Why not? You're an older woman, and she doesn't look at all like you. "He nods again, and I'm reminded of my date. She looked a lot older too. But, still...

2023-12-29 18:04:34
gpt2:  It's a little too thick for my little slut!"

"You're going to tell her you want it?" He asks, he kisses me. "Okay, fine!"

Now I love it when he gets to take my pussy,
2023-12-29 18:05:22
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Then he turns to me. He seems a bit more amiable, and I try to find a small way of acknowledging that he's in fact not my brother. Then he turns to you again, and nods. He then pulls my arm to him
2023-12-29 18:05:32
gpt2:  I could feel the tension running up his spine, I could feel his pain growing over and over in my body, I could feel the tension in my muscles running up into the ceiling, And I know how it feels if my chest doesn't feel up
2023-12-29 18:05:38
gpt2:  "I'd like a sip in my coffee, though." My hand brushes his cheek with a finger. He paces me like a cat on a leash. "Don't worry. This is not the end."

"But if this is
2023-12-29 18:05:46
gpt2:  This time I'd like a shot in my beer, too." so he goes on to ask about why she'd say that and I guess it comes down to what the fuck is wrong with her, you know, I mean, she's totally not

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I turn to her and we're both talking about the weather, with me telling her about the upcoming weekend, but she just blinks and looks at me like she's trying to figure it out on her own.
"You don't look

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "I don't mean to sound hasty, but I'm going to be late."
My jaw drops, "Oh damn." I try to look out to make sure nobody's looking my way, but I'm pretty sure nobody's. I

gpt2:  I realize that she likes to be around me, though, and to have a good time with my siblings, knowing that our lives have been shaped by how they feel about life. She also seems to notice I have a lot of affection for you both

2023-12-29 18:08:35
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  And now, here's a pretty good reason for me to make a drink, but not to keep my hands off her. Maybe a drink of beer won't kill you as much. Maybe a drink of whiskey might be nice. I don't know
2023-12-29 18:08:43
gpt2: 

Well, I think she's getting a little tired of me.

I feel her body getting restless, and her breathing starts to lose focus. I can feel the ground breaking, but I can't touch her; it doesn't move
2023-12-29 18:09:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I want her to know that what she is and who she is, it doesn't matter what happens after tonight. Now I'm a little angry to see her all this way, but I need her to understand that, no matter what, we will
2023-12-29 18:10:32
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"It's fine. I'm going to be late. I'm just so glad you're finally coming back."
I try to smile weakly, and finally she smiles. "Well, how long can you be here?"
The next
2023-12-29 18:11:33
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  She is mine. I own her. But as things turn out, things can change a lot."
She giggled at that. "Well, I guess..." She didn't want to admit that she liked the way he was leaning back and taking

Sucking up to me like a rock

So, this is what you want from me.

For all that I care. I have my heart. I have my right arm around you. I have my hand on your arm

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  She's too hot, too sexy, too smart..." She would have been happier without us holding hands. Of course, I would have been better with other women in my life, but if I had not been such a horny little boy I would have

Her eyes are closed, so my tongue's starting to stick out of her mouth. "Oh, please, please."
I've tried, but I've not had enough.
As her mouth moves away from me in a way that doesn

gpt2:  So how about she take her hands off her thighs, too? Her knees too low and the heels falling down a little? Her legs right down to her hips, too? She'd love to do that, too.
"No, my...
2023-12-29 18:13:41
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I can't believe I'm talking to her, but I'm really glad I'm here, too.
"Well, I can try again today if you like." I say. I want to tell her how much it means to have you back
2023-12-29 18:14:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  If we're going to have sex, she deserves to have everything she needs.

She needs to have the attention of a man.

The other thing is I've always found myself wanting to give you a special treat. I've always
2023-12-29 18:15:18
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

It's as if I can't take anymore. I can't wait any longer. With my hands still on her, I hold her up, and she leans back to get a better angle for penetration, even though the ground is getting soft
2023-12-29 18:16:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

So yeah, it's not easy. I know she gets that, too. But, I can take care of myself. She does want to.
I mean, she's not the only one who's been through enough with both of
2023-12-29 18:16:08
gpt2:  I can have that pain if I don't keep my head down.

"Okay. We're done with this thing. You're done. I'll be back at night."

Sue took the lead and she took down the chair
2023-12-29 18:16:50
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I need to keep my head up and keep myself in control.

After everyone's left, I had to run to the bathroom to wash off. I was about to go into the bathroom when I heard my phone ring. I grabbed it and
2023-12-29 18:17:36
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was shaking just a little now. I could feel the pain from the end of my cock. The pain shot from my cock all the way down to my balls. I was aching again.

"You're all ready for me now
2023-12-29 18:17:44
gpt2:  I made my way to the right and began to get up.

"Look, there's this really big space with a guy outside, right?" I asked.

"Yeah." He said. "He's going to take care of

So we're at the "top" of the hill. And then, there are some small bushes here and there. But those are just a few of the small bushes that come up here.
We're

gpt2:  I wanted to pull my friend's hand and tell her that the door was open. She said yes and I was in.

I walked across the street, walked down the street and walked around the corner to where my friend was walking and when
2023-12-29 18:18:08
gpt2:  You're going to have to have fun with your little girl and have this nice experience." I kept my hands behind my back. I didn't bother to look her in the eye and let go as it was obvious that I was a bit nervous.
2023-12-29 18:18:13
gpt2:  Take off your pants and just relax I'm going to help you relax at the end."

I felt him start to lean down, and I could feel that I was shaking my head. "You don't think your cock is ready to be
2023-12-29 18:18:20
gpt2:  I'm already ready"

"Are you ready?" said she while shaking her head. The pain from her cock shot up over my balls and was moving up and down over my thighs. My erection began to tighten up.

"You

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You know that it's the next step and it's your best shot and it will go the way you want" she said with such a little enthusiasm, I could not help but smile and nod.

She sat down at the table with me
2023-12-29 18:19:14
gpt2:  Are you ready? Look I'm a little bit different, but I know how I want to be. I've got to be. "

"I will be ready. "

"You can't do anything, I will be ready
2023-12-29 18:19:20
gpt2:  "Are you feeling really good or are you worried about the consequences?" I asked after a couple of quick breaths, which she shook her head. "That was probably the only thing I said I meant and I am actually glad you were feeling good about
2023-12-29 18:19:25
gpt2:  I mean, even though you haven't looked good yet, it still means more than that you deserve a chance to show your true self. You'll be seeing me when the time comes."

He smiled at me before walking away from my room
2023-12-29 18:19:30
gpt2:  I asked her if she wanted to put you in some kind of role for her in the future, or if she was waiting for that chance for some unknown reason that she never truly understood. So she went right into it with such a bright smile and

gpt2:  I am your self, your true self to be able to continue to do so." I said.

"You really are that hot and horny right now?" she asked.

"It is so!" said she.

"But

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "Oh

Yeah right! You are horny. Your balls are really full, so full it hurts your ass. "

I stood up and started to rub her pussy. It looked like a nice swollen mushroom with a little juice dripping from

gpt2:  "Oh, you look fine, darling!"

She giggled and hugged me back. "Do you want to play?"

I blinked and then stared at her. My nose was watering so I turned around and turned back to try and
2023-12-29 18:20:50
gpt2:  You look so awesome!" As I told her what I wanted my answer, she said, "Good girl, I will always love you more than any other babe that ever had sex with my mother!" So after some moments and a few awkwardness I
2023-12-29 18:20:56
gpt2:  Well, you are, isn't it? I don't remember what I said. I remember you say "You are going to give me your finger" when I am standing at your side, right?"

"Yes, you can!"

2023-12-29 18:21:02
gpt2:  No way of even knowing what you'd done. Because if they're not really that different then, that would be something that would be extremely weird and shocking. And the one thing she didn't understand is, it was all that she wanted to do
2023-12-29 18:21:08
gpt2:  So thick and big, doesn't it? "

We're having a hard time getting ready for this.

I think I should stop and look around for anything I might need to start.

"Come on babe, stay on
2023-12-29 18:21:18
gpt2:  The way her voice sounded, I thought it sounded like she wasn't at all aware, then I could feel it was so close. I got off the back of her chair so she was already on her back, pulling out a piece of tape to
2023-12-29 18:22:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm going to start to get an erection."

I'm not sure I could actually stand this if the guy was looking at my ass.

"Hey sweetie, can you help me put these on? And don't tell me
2023-12-29 18:23:04
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I pulled out. I hadn't stopped thinking about what happened last night, but was so damn tired, I couldn't concentrate on anything. "Damnit," I thought.
I got up, got dressed, and started my walk back to school
2023-12-29 18:23:51
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I don't want to scare the guys off with this and I don't have the money for it.

You're not going to get hard that easily either. Do you know what kind of underwear I am talking about? What size panties do
2023-12-29 18:24:01
gpt2:  So when are you going to open this up and start sucking?"

"Well I haven't heard from you. I was just a little bit upset about this, you see. And now I'm feeling a little better, I guess. Maybe
2023-12-29 18:24:51
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I asked, "What's going on?" She said, "What's going on, is that you are a total slut." So I quickly started to explain and explain to them that, "The man that was with my mother had his tongue buried
2023-12-29 18:25:39
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Where is his tongue going?"
She said, "So what's going on you asked, you big baby. What's your name, big baby?" I said, "Jack, you're my first fuck. I'm a virgin."
I
2023-12-29 18:25:46
gpt2:  Do I have to wear pants? I'm not good with that." I don't have to say that, but please. Just let it go. So that I can get my ass off. Now it's time to move off the bed. Are
2023-12-29 18:25:52
gpt2:  I'm not good with that. Okay. There you go. Now move. It'll be really hard. (Sighs) But... Okay. I mean, I'm still wet on my butt. So you'd like that? Good.
2023-12-29 18:25:58
gpt2:  I'm not good with that." I don't have to say that, but please. Just let it go. So that I can get my ass off.

You can also play it nice by doing something like "Hey, can you feel
2023-12-29 18:26:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But not that I won't help you."

He went from looking me over with that sly look in his eyes to looking at his feet. And I wasn't sure what to do.

Finally, I turned to the guy. "
2023-12-29 18:27:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So move. It'll be really hard."
This is one of those phrases that gets you pretty good into trouble pretty fast, but it doesn't seem to apply just yet.
"Not like this. Move."
I take a deep breath
2023-12-29 18:28:14
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'll show you.

Don't move. You're about to see how my panties are made, and they are made for a girl who looks like me to be naked. I wore those panties because my dad wanted me to go down on
2023-12-29 18:28:21
gpt2:  Let me just move you your butt on your bed. I'll just turn it around, and kiss you up the top. (Sigh) I'll just keep stroking it. No, just kiss it a little. (Laughing,
2023-12-29 18:28:26
gpt2:  She laughed, then said, "You are good at telling off, baby. I'm going to keep your hands on you all day."
I let out a big orgasm, and started to suck you and then give it to you when you could
2023-12-29 18:28:32
gpt2:  You should be able to find it."

And the guy said, "Good job, but not a good look."

When he came to me, I was already half lying down. I was already panting and was sweating because of
2023-12-29 18:29:17
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It's not as if I didn't know I would be a virgin. She looked at me as if this were the funniest thing that's happened in years, and she reached out to take my cock in her hand.
She said, "
2023-12-29 18:29:25
gpt2:  It's really, really hot." It sounds a little creepy, but in any case, that's OK with me.

Also, I can't wait to meet and hang out with you guys. I love hanging out with you. We hang
2023-12-29 18:30:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I've never felt as good with a cock in my mouth, as I did tonight with my dad's. The hotness of the night was great, but at some point I wanted him to take control and put his cock in my mouth. I
2023-12-29 18:30:26
gpt2:  I don't know what I did after that. (laughs) So I was just doing it for the night. I wanted to have sex with you and not be worried about going into the bathroom or shower. You could tell that I was really into
2023-12-29 18:30:34
gpt2:  I just felt like I went off the watch.

That was not the only one I saw in the house, though. I was getting tired of her asking me, "What are you, being a girl?"

"Oh shit.
2023-12-29 18:31:38
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Then I left you for a young girl and tried to go home." She looked at me puzzled.
"I left you at that young age, when you told me you had a boyfriend. I... I don't know." I wasn't able
2023-12-29 18:32:52
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  When I returned, she was on her back and was eating you out. You were hard again as she sucked you. I leaned over and you said, "I want to lick you again baby, or would you like to lick me off again?
2023-12-29 18:33:04
gpt2:  I didn't want her to believe it, so I went to the motel. I went to the living room. I told her to call my dad's number and she did. That's when she said she didn't want me to fuck anyone on
2023-12-29 18:33:12
gpt2:  I had a little argument with her." It wasn't until I left you that I realized what was wrong with you. She wanted more of what she had left for you. She wanted you to be free. And I didn't want you to have
2023-12-29 18:33:20
gpt2:  I found a bed and I took a shower, then slept.

I went out and went to the house. This time I was with a big group of guys, mostly about five guys, and I was in the bathroom watching a couple of
2023-12-29 18:33:28
gpt2:  We share the same bed and all I can think about is getting to know each other better and getting things done. I love the bed, I love having fun and I love going out for beer and catching up with friends. I have a lot going
2023-12-29 18:33:37
gpt2:  I told her she could have sex with her boyfriend as well, but she wasn't interested. I got out of bed and sat on the bed with my hands around the waist. She grabbed me in her arms and said, "Oh, you have
2023-12-29 18:34:52
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  A few minutes later she came out with a smile.
She was wearing some sort of tight, blue skirt, a tight sweater with the sleeves rolled up, and a very short, tight shirt with her nipples pinched through. She had a hair
2023-12-29 18:35:04
gpt2:  That's a lie!"

"Oh good. It's OK, I know it, I just wanted to get a new one but I'm not sure if she will want any more. I don't really want this person anymore!"


2023-12-29 18:35:06
gpt2: 
2023-12-29 18:35:15
gpt2:  It was pretty much her height, although she was about 6'7" and had a pretty good body.
"Hey, do you want to come?"
She pulled off the skirt that was pinned to her waist. She stood up to walk
2023-12-29 18:35:24
gpt2:  Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
2023-12-29 18:35:32
gpt2:  It's not my pussy. I love my pussy and I love what you want." My hips were going up and down as I moved faster than her. Her nipples were turning red and red. I couldn't stop licking it. As we pulled our
2023-12-29 18:36:46
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "You look amazing." She said.
I guess it's obvious where I am from her voice, but her smile wasn't too different from my own.
"Did you see the look on your face, huh?"
"Oh! Of
2023-12-29 18:36:57
gpt2: 

"That's not my pussy, just like I know the picture is fake! Do you know what that means?"


"Oh no I don't know!"


I just turned around to go to her and that's when I
2023-12-29 18:37:06
gpt2:  I have to do it again, and so I put on the condom and go fuck myself!

The condom went and I went in and it is that condom that is actually my dick and it goes back and forth. I just can't take
2023-12-29 18:37:15
gpt2:  Why you don't even want to hear my name!"

I replied with my hand on my hips, "I don't think we have a problem. It's not that I was expecting you to take your hand off me. Just you don

gpt2: 
He looked up as he picked up his cup.
It was almost hot in this room
In this room.
"Alright. I will come see my sister."
When I said 'we', she looked up and gave me a serious
2023-12-29 18:38:30
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So don't try to get us both off now!" I grinned and replied, "You are quite correct about the first point, so stop trying to get me to say anything then!"
She pulled me into bed, and rolled me over. "
2023-12-29 18:39:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"It's just me, why don't you lead me? I'll follow your lead."
She led us to a wall and we saw a doorway. I led her to the door. It was kind of heavy, and she stepped out
2023-12-29 18:40:57
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  look, you won't get to enjoy my beautiful and beautiful sister,
You can either enjoy her or you can lose your virginity to her.
This room is the most sexless room in the house.
The only thing in the room is
2023-12-29 18:41:10
gpt2: 

Why is this important to me?

I will go ahead with this, I'm already using it. My sisters have already made it all up in that moment, and I'm just so happy about it.

So I am
2023-12-29 18:42:42
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I know her pussy tastes better than I can imagine. "
As our positions changed and the new position and position, your pussy was still in sight. She was smiling as you watched me eat your pussy. It was the best fucking ever! I
2023-12-29 18:43:52
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I can still taste it. "You see it's like a different taste. It's like the whole taste and texture is a different taste. Your pussy is just as good. I want to have more of that. I just need some more."
2023-12-29 18:44:07
gpt2:  I just think it is horrible that I can do this to a guy like that.

Then when I do it to you I really feel what she feels, then I go on and do it and I just feel really good. But then it
2023-12-29 18:44:21
gpt2:  It's like, this is just fucking crazy. And I just feel awful for having a guy get all of these things from me, as a man. When you get a woman to give you a blowjob like that it just goes back to a

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Then she turned and took the light and the light bulb and turned it on and it went off.
"Well there you go we will leave the lights on and the music down for now. No one will come in."
"Now what to
2023-12-29 18:47:05
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I was surprised that my mother was so beautiful that she made me squint and look around. She was wearing a pretty little dress that came up about four inches above her knee.
"Well how do I look"
"Beautiful,
2023-12-29 18:47:17
gpt2:  I went back to running up the stairs.
I looked over and I noticed how the door slid open, and then I ran into the main street.
The light changed. The street light went out.
I looked over and in the rear
2023-12-29 18:47:26
gpt2:  And I was just very uncomfortable.

I have been through it before because when you run, you are not running backwards.

I am not running back backwards. I am running up stairs. I am doing what the guys say, if
2023-12-29 18:47:35
gpt2: 

Just a little more time.

Oh well.

And it was just me.

Then I went back to running.

And run!

Run!

And run now.

But my legs
2023-12-29 18:47:44
gpt2: 

Ah, well.

Now there's no longer any time for me to run.

Well, I get back to my desk and tell it so.

Huh?

I didn't say that at all.

2023-12-29 18:48:59
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "

My cock twitched, now, this being my first sexual experience, feeling a new excitement.
I was also slightly embarrassed that I did not know the guys were all on the other side of the door,

They are there
2023-12-29 18:50:05
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  What the hell was I thinking? I could not think straight!

I should have stopped now, but I did not. There was no way I could do this. No way. I tried to think about anything other than fucking, but all
2023-12-29 18:51:09
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It was not only my cock though. It was my face. I opened my eyes and was looking at my ex-wife.

I looked at her pretty face and I could not see her. Her eyes were closed, and she smiled,
2023-12-29 18:52:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You are right about my clothes and I had something similar on when we got dressed and came back. I just wish it didn't feel so wrong not to put it back on."
"This is the right thing to do," I replied to her
2023-12-29 18:52:16
gpt2:  I was also really fucking cock, I felt myself getting harder! I felt that hot cum just getting all over the place!

I did not even think this thing could last so long. But I really did. And I was all over the
2023-12-29 18:52:22
gpt2:  I would never have done that if I couldn't feel myself getting bigger. I felt my heart start to pound, so many, many times, it began to throb with my chest. I am not talking about something I can stop now.


2023-12-29 18:52:28
gpt2: 

As I was trying to stand up,

My boyfriend was taking his cock out, his hand on mine,

I felt myself go harder.

My cock twitched harder, I knew I was getting wet,


2023-12-29 18:53:35
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was getting a bit aroused at this point and I could feel my lips begin to close. He made it sound like a request. I was trying to respond, I tried my best, but when he pulled my hair and began rubbing on my back
2023-12-29 18:53:46
gpt2:  I tried to push him,

But all I could manage was to think about making myself go harder!

And I couldn't think of a way to stop it.

I could not leave the house without my fucking boyfriend.

2023-12-29 18:54:50
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

And I could not think of a way to stop it!

I didn't know if he'd fuck me and I didn't know if he'd think I'd just give it up.
I couldn't tell him that he wouldn
2023-12-29 18:55:52
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I had to get away,

He had a great fucking body, I could not believe how big it got all the way to my hand.

All I knew was that this was going to be one of my many fantasies of the next
2023-12-29 18:57:01
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

My right hand wrapped around it, I reached up and found it with my thumb. I squeezed it,

Fuck, I can't wait until we get home.

My left hand came back and started sliding back up the length
2023-12-29 18:58:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I got to the top and started pumping it.

I couldn't take it anymore, I moved it under me, and took my hand away,

Oh my god, he couldn't cum yet! His mouth was all wide open,
2023-12-29 18:59:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I wanted to cum hard.

 I was close now,

But I stopped, just as I started,

No, I started,

"Oh God." I groaned,

I was going to cum,


2023-12-29 18:59:09
gpt2: 

In a moment I began to get the feeling that he was not going to let me stop, that this was going to be a very, very long time. I could feel the pain in his legs. The pain in his legs.

2023-12-29 19:00:16
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

And if I was doing this, than I had to keep going. If I was stopping, I knew I would probably go crying from the sheer intensity of the feelings and I certainly didn't want to do that.

I was beginning
2023-12-29 19:01:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was getting harder and harder, and my hands were grabbing his shoulders, he looked at me with a smile and I could see he was enjoying his own stimulation as much as I was, his fingers ran up my thighs and found my little button.
2023-12-29 19:02:45
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

My cock was still hard and throbbing, the tip still in my hand, pumping in and out faster and faster.

He took a quick breath.

"You're fucking hot."

God, I was just thinking
2023-12-29 19:02:56
gpt2: 

It was obvious to me, the world was now about to become one with me, I kept pushing my hands against his shoulders, his body, his body and that just gave me a kick out of his neck, he looked into my eyes
2023-12-29 19:04:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  with more compassion than any other time I had seen him. His gaze, he gave me that hard stare, it almost hurt.

I looked up at him, and he looked up at me with a smile as he leaned down and kissed my
2023-12-29 19:04:22
gpt2: . I could see it as if he could see me as well, his hand was in my left hand and my right hand wrapped around his neck. I tried to go into my mouth as I could but I heard him scream. I looked up,
2023-12-29 19:05:14
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  His eyes made me so hot, they took my breath away. It couldn't have been more perfect. We must have been together for almost 25 years.
In the midst of all of this, he began to smile and take in my hair.
2023-12-29 19:06:13
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So hot to hear him say that. But then, he must be getting close because I could see his chest heaving. Damn, he was so hot to hear him say that. I closed my eyes and blew my load as loudly as I could
2023-12-29 19:07:35
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But then, he must be getting close because I could see his chest heaving. Damn, he was so hot to hear him say that.
I finally gave up and got up from my bed. The whole front door buzzed so I hurried

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But then, he must be getting close because I could see his chest heaving. Damn, he was so hot to hear him say that. I closed my eyes and blew my load as loudly as I could.

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Are you sure you're ok if I do this too" he whispered.
I turned to face him and we stood in front of the mirror.
"What are you gonna do? You said something about putting them out. I was

gpt2:  I could see that if I put these up you were going to be ok. I'm sorry but there is no way to take a shower but I'm not in control of myself." I said to my mom.
"We can get dressed.
2023-12-29 19:10:55
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But I was not in a way. I was trying to hide it. He got angry. He started yelling at me for not telling him to stop. I knew he was right but I had to help him out. He was angry at the way
2023-12-29 19:12:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was so damn close. I was about to cum again in his mouth and then he was saying something and I heard him whisper something and then he was saying something to me to make sure that you didn't cum too fast and I could hear it
2023-12-29 19:12:11
gpt2:  I said I'm sorry but I cannot do that. There was no other way of doing it. I said I'm trying to help a different person. I wasn't going to say anything. He called me in the room one time. "Let

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So was I, but it was too late now"
I nodded.
"Is that the biggest problem I have with this?"
He nodded.
"I don't know. Sometimes my head just goes where I want it to go.

I sat back down, my arms outstretched, looking at myself. When I thought I was done with my work, I looked down at my desk and smiled.

2023-12-29 19:15:07
gpt2:  And I don't think that there is an appropriate answer. Because I am an extremely close family member. And if something is really wrong with what happened with them, I'm going to get to that person. It is my own problem, not yours
2023-12-29 19:15:13
gpt2:  And to see that there are actually three parents out there who have nothing to do with my life and have no idea about the things I've done that have had consequences?

So I think that in our society there is always a concern for human
2023-12-29 19:16:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That's really hard to understand. When I first met him I thought I would have to come up with a reason to call out to him. Now, I know I don't have a valid reason to do so. Because I never really have a
2023-12-29 19:17:24
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

I will say that I don't even really have a story to tell the parents that they will hear about anything they don't want me to tell their children. I have to admit that I have had plenty to say and do that's been
2023-12-29 19:17:35
gpt2:  But they told me that they are very upset by it and want their children to know that it was an awful experience. And I didn't do it, and I didn't give them the benefit of the doubt that I would be able to give them
2023-12-29 19:17:41
gpt2:  I have only had a few conversations, so they will probably want to give me that information. It is what it is.


The other thing that I have not experienced so far is that the teacher had to tell me a lot of stuff.
2023-12-29 19:17:48
gpt2: 

I do not want my father to know how long my friends and relatives will be trying to hold this against me. It might be too late.

After all it's not like I'm worried about them hurting my feelings and my parents
2023-12-29 19:18:48
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
So, I decide to tell my therapist that we don't have much more time, so I need to tell her now. I haven't had a chance to explain or explain what's going on in my head.
My therapist asks if I
2023-12-29 19:18:59
gpt2:  I'm on call to have my parents go to the hospital in an hour and I don't have time for that.

I call the hospital and they say there's a lady in the reception and she's asking me not to tell anyone.
2023-12-29 19:19:05
gpt2:  And she goes, 'Well, now I can't make it up to you and give you my advice as to whether to have children and whether to give them that support or not.' She was so disgusted that she went and said, 'You're
2023-12-29 19:19:11
gpt2:  We live in a society where there is no law prohibiting it, so what I would say is there is a real need for a law prohibiting people from having children, and I am an atheist but I am deeply concerned about how that's affecting people and
2023-12-29 19:20:18
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I've given this advice to hundreds of women and they all think they're in love with me and that's the reason they call me out, because their 'in love' does not include having me as a man. Well, you have just made
2023-12-29 19:20:28
gpt2:  But this is completely out of line for them.

My story began when I had my first big fat son.

He had been born and raised by a loving father and a very caring mother. We both attended my school so our family
2023-12-29 19:20:35
gpt2:  That I do not want to be a woman, that my love for me has got to be more or less diluted or whatever. There are certainly other factors in here, but they wanted to talk about that and I've come around to saying you don
2023-12-29 19:21:40
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Yours is different."
I couldn't help but laugh at that one. "My love for you is diluted by being a girl."
She laughed as well but then stopped, "I knew I shouldn't have said that but you're right
2023-12-29 19:22:43
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I mean even if I was at my best in school, I'm not very good at anything.
I am the girl all their friends want to be, but I am not. They want me to be like myself, they want my body to
2023-12-29 19:22:54
gpt2:  He asks if I've been acting in a positive way, like something positive about myself or if it makes me feel better. I answer this only a bit. He doesn't explain to me how my bad behavior can make him look bad or make me
2023-12-29 19:23:58
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
As if that makes a difference, he says "Well, that's a good thing that you've been talking to me."
I don't know what to say to him. The way he says it makes me feel like I have to say
2023-12-29 19:25:01
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I've just never heard you talk about it. I guess a guy has to make sure he knows what he's getting himself into before he can make a decision." He's probably right though, and he really does seem like a good guy to be
2023-12-29 19:25:13
gpt2:  And you like my body," to which I say, "Yeah!"
But he doesn't, so I'm happy to ask him that. So I ask him if he's on drugs, the time they're gone. What happens to me?
2023-12-29 19:25:21
gpt2:  I know it. I like it, and I just enjoy playing with it. You're the only girl who looks like me. That's what you want!"
I said yes. No, you're too stupid to understand, but we should talk
2023-12-29 19:25:27
gpt2:  That's fine! But we'll take care of this together, okay?"
"Yeah! We'll take care of this together," I said. And, of course, I told her, "Yes! That's great, too! I love
2023-12-29 19:25:34
gpt2:  He has a little bit of an idea that maybe we can help him. He comes over with something so he can show me how it works and help me out. He explains how he has already seen that I'm having a great time because my problems
2023-12-29 19:25:40
gpt2: 


I mean you're saying that to me right now?


It's kind of a weird thing to be doing this, because I love the way you've always done this show, but it's weird when you suddenly start talking about something
2023-12-29 19:25:46
gpt2: 


Yeah, I'm going to have to give up some marijuana. And I am going to lose all that power, and I will never grow anything. I will have to lose that sense of self, my pride and my pleasure in life.
2023-12-29 19:26:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 


It's kind of a weird thing to be doing this, because I love the way you've always done this show, but it's weird when you suddenly start talking about something


I mean you're saying that to me right now?
2023-12-29 19:28:03
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 


It's kind of weird, that's what I say to myself. I think about what I'm doing and thinking about it.


It's like it's getting to you and I'm sure it's getting to you, that's
2023-12-29 19:29:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I don't understand. Like, are you making fun of me?


You're always having a moment like this like this with me, sometimes when you look really hard at me and you're kind of, you know, getting sad or something
2023-12-29 19:30:14
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I never told you but, just as an aside, I think you have the nicest little body."
"Uh, you're just saying that because I've noticed you checking me out," she shot back, her hands reaching to adjust my belt
2023-12-29 19:31:06
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
But then you're saying that to me in this weird way that makes it just... like. That you kind of get excited, if it weren't for all the bad that I did to you for making me say that shit. So I'm
2023-12-29 19:31:18
gpt2:  "Oh yeah, we do that every day"
"Yeah, yeah, I do, but I like it that way. I enjoy playing with it. I'm so into it. I'm not so into getting fucked by a girl like you
2023-12-29 19:31:24
gpt2:  That you kind of get excited, if it weren't for all the bad that I did to you for making me say that shit. So I'm really excited by the way that all of your tweets were posted on me today. I was just doing
2023-12-29 19:32:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
And I had no idea that you actually were going to go and do it that way.
Hey, listen. If you didn't want to, okay.
You still want to do this to me? Well, I'm glad that I
2023-12-29 19:32:40
gpt2:  And then you start to cry.


No, it's so hard.

SARAH TALIPINO: I'm here when you're crying.

JAMES GREENE: I can't help it. I was talking
2023-12-29 19:33:36
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
As I walked into the bathroom, I thought. I should do the shower, but it's too late for that now. I turned on the faucet, and I looked into the showerhead, then realized that I was not using it
2023-12-29 19:34:32
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  And I'm like, "Oh fuck" and I'm sort of being a wimp, and I'm sort of fucking you too much." And you start crying and all of a sudden we're both so overwhelmed, we're just... overwhelmed,
2023-12-29 19:35:36
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I can't be nice anymore. I could probably see you in a moment but it would be too awkward. And then you would just look at me, and there you are, and I'm not looking at you in a good way. I'm
2023-12-29 19:35:48
gpt2:  I don't know how to handle you, you know? And you know how I do it, and I'm kind of a wimp. I'm a jerk. Like, "Hey, you're okay, no need to make fun of me
2023-12-29 19:35:54
gpt2: 

Yeah, no.

Do you think we're really going to be getting any better?

No. You know, I think we're going to be fine. We're always trying to get better in this world. And that
2023-12-29 19:36:52
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I can't stop thinking about all the places I have to do something bad. There's always the worst. I mean, I don't know, if I can just get you to forgive me then we could be fine. I think I really do
2023-12-29 19:37:50
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I really wanted to tell you how bad that was. But that would be weird. I don't think that that I can." I tell her and she really begins to cry and sob into the pillow again.
"I really am sorry for your
2023-12-29 19:38:01
gpt2:  I had to pull myself together.

SARAH TALIPINO: Is it any different now?

JAMES GREENE: It's very rare. It's not like it's happening every day. We have a very different

gpt2: 

I looked down at the towel-like surface. When I turned my head, I heard a woman's voice from above saying, "It's a shame you're taking this too long, but how long do you have to wait?"

2023-12-29 19:38:14
gpt2:  The real thing was I was just thinking about my dream, and that's all I did with my life.

So you guys had a big big conversation?

It was really my thing. I was like, man, we haven't
2023-12-29 19:38:23
gpt2: 

Why did you feel like you needed a real job?

It was really my dream to be in the video game industry. And I think people got so excited for that in 2012. For me, it was a pretty cool dream to
2023-12-29 19:38:30
gpt2:  I didn't have anything to worry about. I was very happy when I looked at the towel-like surface with my right hand. If it were up in my hands, I wouldn't have had any trouble taking my time with the job anymore.
2023-12-29 19:38:36
gpt2:  I had a strong interest in video game development.

You say it was a good time to be a musician in the '90s. Can you talk about that experience and its impact to current music fans?

It was pretty exciting.
2023-12-29 19:39:33
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The music and film industry in general was still a bit of an unorganized mess, so there weren't any big studios around. That being said, you're in the room with me. Most of my friends were, too. We went to a
2023-12-29 19:39:44
gpt2:  But then one day I saw a film I was working on and a whole bunch of the guys came up with their own music and I said, "I'm gonna do it!" They worked at a tiny studio in Florida that did some really pretty good
2023-12-29 19:40:48
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But at the start of the pandemic when everything changed, some studios, like the ones in New York and London were willing to make concessions for better working conditions. For example, a film about a young young man with a mother who has just died
2023-12-29 19:40:57
gpt2:  And then you were getting calls from the rest of the country.

Was that a really interesting idea?

Yes, I did a lot of small films before I began. I do think some of the stuff I've made is a little
2023-12-29 19:42:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Some of these concessions seemed to be for health reasons. People knew if they worked as many hours at a break, they might be back to having to make their living just as the rest of us would be. Others, like the studios in Hong Kong
2023-12-29 19:43:06
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I still had no idea how long I would have left on the floor with the other volunteers, but I was doing okay.
As for the rest of them, I was glad that I did not have to wait for the next batch to fill the
2023-12-29 19:44:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  They were all really good and they seemed to have a great crew, but I could tell from the way one guy looked at me a few of the guys wouldn't want to work with me. He was a real geek and it was hard to get
2023-12-29 19:46:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So I was just a bit frustrated.
"When I got back to LA I realized just how much less work it had gotten and how boring it had become." She sighed. "I just got the idea that maybe it was time to move,
2023-12-29 19:46:44
gpt2:  I was like, "Oh well, I'll just get along with the rest of my crew."

It was amazing. I had been approached for a job and I met a guy who had just started as an engineer on a project and he
2023-12-29 19:48:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Anyway, as she went on to tell them she told them they could come around whenever they wanted and that they could help with the editing.
"Plus," she added in a conspiratorial tone, "that the director and director plus the casting director
2023-12-29 19:49:55
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm on my own here." I said to myself.
The night was coming to a close, and the whole crew was tired from the previous days work, but I managed to hold on through the darkness and the cold. I could have spent
2023-12-29 19:51:24
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So I put everything I had worked for my life into making this life better for myself. I set my office down with the key to my apartment and let it be mine. And now I'm free to let my mind wander. This was the beginning
2023-12-29 19:52:49
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  He didn't do much but we all worked hard.
I was a little awkward but I was also a little excited and I wanted to enjoy the company of everyone on my first night. I figured I would see who I could get a work out
2023-12-29 19:54:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

I would just like to know if you like my work so much.

I really like it! Do you have anything that would suit me.

Your voice. It's so soft and sweet.

I'm sure it
2023-12-29 19:56:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The crew were nice and gave me some space but I was also like a kid in a candy store. I was kind of an "average" girl for my age.

This guy was very nice but he didn't like me at all.
2023-12-29 19:57:40
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The place was almost mine as I lived with my parents but the crew helped but that's the only money I had to be happy. My apartment is clean and I made use of the internet to make some investments and earn some money. I got a
2023-12-29 19:57:54
gpt2:  I was in some places and there were lots of candy stores around here. The whole day was really awesome. I loved my company, I really liked my job, I really liked being a part of the crew and it was fun. So then I
2023-12-29 19:58:11
gpt2:  I started my day with our food. It was sweet food and then it got interesting in our food selection but our overall experience was great. I loved our coffee, tea and even desserts, like vanilla or maple tea. It was amazing. The first
2023-12-29 19:58:18
gpt2:  The whole day was really awesome. I loved my company, I really liked my job, I really liked being a part of the crew and it was fun.

So you're not sure if there was anything in the food you were hungry for
2023-12-29 19:59:25
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I got to show off my abilities to the men in the gang, get them used to the idea that I wasn't that much of an ass so they could get on with life. When we got home, I invited Jim and Sandy into our bed
2023-12-29 19:59:38
gpt2: 

Well done! The only thing I am really missing though is the love. I would rather give love than see someone who can truly love one's soul than watch my work get turned down by a project.

Do you have any free

But we were in the basement and it looked like all of the men were inside, and they took them out

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

It was only when they finally calmed down that I stopped laughing.

They had gone to the shower area and were making their own hair and makeup. I heard a noise and then the door opened.

We hadn't really known

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I mean I really did have to get a handle on it but I was still a little uncomfortable with how much time we spent around each other.
I really did just want to get back home and have one more drink and sleep off the wine.

"He was talking, which I didn't like too much, but it did

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
She looked up at me. I looked up at her. She gave me a huge smile. Then suddenly she got out and walked towards me and hugged me. "Thank you Jack."
I hugged her back, I knew right away she wanted
2023-12-29 20:16:16
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "I got something for you today."
I went into the bathroom, opened the cabinet drawer and pulled out the bottle. I picked it up and handed it to her. "Here," she said, handing me the bottle. I walked out to
2023-12-29 20:17:22
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I didn't know what was wrong. She just sat there and I put the alarm down. My heart was pounding, my heart was hammering in my chest.
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
I looked up at her
2023-12-29 20:18:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I saw her standing there in her panties and garter belt. "Don't worry about it," she said as she took another couple of sips from the bottle. "I just got dressed for you." I said as I took the bottle and
2023-12-29 20:19:32
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I need a second to think." I stood and walked her to the door.

"Please don't take me to the hospital," she whispered.

"I know but if it was me then I wouldn't do this."


2023-12-29 20:20:17
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I looked at the clock on my night stand it read 10: 00. Shit! I sat there for a minute thinking. I wasn't going to do it! She probably wouldn't have anything to get worked up over.
"I don't
2023-12-29 20:20:25
gpt2:  Do you think you might need to talk to me if you need to, are you?" I asked.

"I don't want to have anyone else to talk to about it with," she responded, "because you're my sister and I
2023-12-29 20:21:13
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "

"I'm sure we can find a way to come up with a solution. What you said about me being the only one, I was just telling them, that I was just that and I wasn't going to take the time to
2023-12-29 20:22:01
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "
"Yeah, I would."
"Then why don't you come to my house?"
I went up to the door, it was unlocked. She unlocked it from behind me and I followed her in, walking up her driveway with my

gpt2:  I mean, he was talking about a bunch of people, and I was saying I don't see a lot of stuff coming from, but he said, "Well, this is how they keep you guys up at night, by taking you to their
2023-12-29 20:22:58
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But now, I have to make a couple of calls. "she said." Maybe another time, but for right now, we need to get started. "
"Okay."
I took her to my place, gave her a quick kiss on
2023-12-29 20:23:39
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I am on the road.
"I will not let you down," she begged me.
I picked up my phone and dialed the number she was calling for.
"Hello?"<|endoftext|>
2023-12-29 20:24:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  She locked herself in the house and I went inside and took the call. It was a very pleasant conversation, she listened to me for a few minutes then she told me some of her business, she was actually a very nice woman and a very successful
2023-12-29 20:24:37
gpt2:  It was about 20 minutes later on the next day. She gave me that I was going to the bathroom. Then I heard the sound of someone banging on the door and I thought 'oh no, what are you doing, you're too scared to
2023-12-29 20:25:24
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  When it was just my parents, I just sat there for a while, worried. I had an urge to call you but my mind was in a whirl."

"I'm glad I was there to help," I replied.
"
2023-12-29 20:26:11
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I asked her when she was going to start her second year, she told me that she was in the middle of it and I was going to have to help her work through the first year and figure out the details."
"So, now we
2023-12-29 20:27:04
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Now you're about to start your second year."
"Well, at first I was worried that I'd be too much help. So I worked on my parents and they were doing okay. But now we are. And I feel like I can
2023-12-29 20:27:14
gpt2:  You're about to start your second year."
When you're ready to start your first year, there are some things you can do, because you're about to start your second year.
"Yeah, I have one rule: I'll work
2023-12-29 20:28:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  We were now out of the shower and drying off, having just wrapped up the shower. I gave her a good, hard fuck from behind, which she loved. "You wanna give a good show like that to my boss's daughter?
"
2023-12-29 20:28:51
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I gave her a good, hard fuck from behind, which she loved. "
It seemed like it took a while before we could get her to cum. But she finally gave in. She went back to the shower and started washing her beautiful body
2023-12-29 20:29:02
gpt2:  I gave her a good, hard fuck from behind, which she loved. "You wanna give a good show like that to my boss's daughter? My pussy was getting wet when I pulled your cock out. She got into that tight little anal hole
2023-12-29 20:29:07
gpt2:  Then I heard another male voice call to me and he pushed my hands up against the door and started choking me with his tongue. The male grabbed me by the hair and pulled me off of my feet. I was so scared that I didn't care
2023-12-29 20:29:56
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  After I was done my head started going back and forth between the cock sucking cock and the male's, which I realized wasn't just a blow job. In less than a minute they took off, then we laid on the bed. As I lay
2023-12-29 20:30:03
gpt2: 
"So my partner found out the dick was hard when we were working on it," she said.
2023-12-29 20:30:56
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm really nervous but excited about what we're about to do. I've not had that feeling like this before in my life. It's like there is something about a cock in your mouth that is making you want to get on your knees and
2023-12-29 20:31:43
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm sure she's looking for some action. She doesn't really work that hard."
"You're really a nervous wreck though. That sounds rough. I'm actually ready to cum right now."
She wrapped her hands around my cock and
2023-12-29 20:32:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm not sure if I'm going to like it or not but it just had to be. We got to the room, got changed into our suits and grabbed our bags. I had my jacket, and she had her jacket around her. I
2023-12-29 20:33:08
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "After he left, I got a little emotional. I spent the rest of the day, thinking about what he did."
"And did you do what?"
"I did, but I couldn't remember. I needed to get a grip
2023-12-29 20:33:59
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I wanted to do it with you before. I had a good feel on you already, so it feels a little scary. You have a nice cock, aren't you. So why the hell have you made me feel so good?
"I
2023-12-29 20:34:09
gpt2:  I just wanted to go home. The girl went to sleep."

The woman eventually called police and the man told them he had been attacked and that a friend of his had already been accused.

According to the CBC report, the victim
2023-12-29 20:34:55
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But I was scared and just had to be sure.
"Thanks for being so generous"
She smiled and kissed me on the cheek "Of course, but I have to talk to Ms. Peterson."
"No, don't, go
2023-12-29 20:35:41
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I couldn't stop him from choking me, I felt like he was going to kill me. He continued to nibble on my skin all the way to the bed.
"I have to take you away from here," he whispered.
"
2023-12-29 20:35:52
gpt2:  My legs started to tighten as they lay on each other, and I had to take turns stroking their lids. At this point I knew for sure that I had been on my knees. But my hands were still too big, and I was
2023-12-29 20:35:58
gpt2:  At this point I knew for sure that I had been on my knees.

A little later, I found myself in the car of one of them. A lot of the work was done by myself and my husband. But the hardest part was
2023-12-29 20:36:04
gpt2:  That's when I started noticing this slight tingling coming in my left eye. It really hit."
"I was starting to get so tense that I pulled my leg up over his elbow and just stared up at him. And then you started
2023-12-29 20:36:59
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  And I could see the tears forming."
"Thanks for caring and I am sorry."
She hugged me to her "It's okay baby I don't ever have to worry about that."
I turned to leave to the hallway and there stood
2023-12-29 20:37:47
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I've always had this effect on the doctors, you know? They say it's more of a mental thing, but I know that's not really the case."
"So what did you do, and what happened?"
"I went to
2023-12-29 20:38:34
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

"Who were they?"

"He said they called an ambulance as well."

"Was he alive?"

"He got into a car with another passenger."

"Are you sure they were the ones that killed
2023-12-29 20:39:22
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You are the last person on the planet I would ever want to harm."
He crawled around me until he reached the bed. He climbed onto the bed with me and I closed my eyes in pleasure.
"Take me with you," he whispered
2023-12-29 20:39:32
gpt2:  As a kid, I would watch a movie called In Search of the Greatest Child and I would watch that play of a kid that played baseball with his family and it just kept going and going and going. I kept looking out the window, and I
2023-12-29 20:39:37
gpt2:  As a child, I would watch a movie called "Sesame Street and I would look out the window and the lights would go out of the house and they were all like, 'oh, what am I doing, Mom, that is so great
2023-12-29 20:40:37
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: ' And that was the only time I saw a light switch go out, and even then, it only lasted until they were in bed, or until the bathroom door opened..."
"And that was the only time I watched a light switch go out
2023-12-29 20:40:45
gpt2: , you know, we need to keep working. We need to keep going!'"
2023-12-29 20:41:32
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
In my last semester there was a movie called 'My Little Pony' where I knew about a cartoon girl that had sex with a horse. I didn't know that was what it was, I had seen that play on TV but it had never

gpt2:  I knew the time when the doctor told me that the surgery had worked and he didn't even think about it at all. I was like, okay, I'm fine. I'm not going to lose my grip. You're not going to lose
2023-12-29 20:41:47
gpt2:  All of a sudden he was trying to walk and she was starting to cry because she was too busy telling him how awful her little sister was with that.
I stood there for just 3 or 4 minutes before I saw her crying. I could hardly

gpt2:  That was my day in my life." She said. "I've never been so happy at some point, and I'm trying to get through that tomorrow, to see where the future is."
Then the next morning she got a text from Dr
2023-12-29 20:42:01
gpt2:  And I cried all the way through my trial and tribulations.
And I was actually like, What am I going to do this day?!
Because her whole life was going down, and my body wasn't functioning.
And all I had
2023-12-29 20:42:56
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I had no friends, I was just someone that looked out my window, like I didn't exist. And I had always been a kid.
So I came home from school with a raging hard on that didn't help matters at all. I

gpt2:  And the next morning I heard him say, "Hey, come on man, just don't do this to me again." "I won't lose you man, you don't have to lose me man," I didn't know, I didn't
2023-12-29 20:43:15
gpt2:  So that's one thing I did that year, there's no way I'm going to get more of that, I mean no way. I think that all of my friends have had different experiences. I'm sure that there's some way to help
2023-12-29 20:44:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I think that all of my friends have had different experiences. I'm sure that there's some way to help So that's one thing I did that year, there's no way I'm going to get more of that, I mean no way.
2023-12-29 20:44:24
gpt2:  She said I'm not ready to do anything with my life, and you know I'm not ready to make money off of the things that I own or buy. I'm not even sure what to do with it. So I just go with what
2023-12-29 20:44:29
gpt2:  And so, I've gotten that in return for all those years of trying not to leave, so I have to come up with whatever deal I can make. That's why I have no money, no one is ever going to stop me, no
2023-12-29 20:44:34
gpt2: 
And I really don't want anything from my money. And my children go through my kids' education. My children go through my kids' college.
I mean, I don't even know.
So I didn't even have time to
2023-12-29 20:44:41
gpt2:  Maybe I'll never know what happened to this. I'll never know how my life ended.
But it was a good moment for me. I didn't take the time to remember that what had happened had happened to me. You have to remember
2023-12-29 20:45:37
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I'm not asking you, and you shouldn't be, so I won't ask if you want me to. Because she is pretty much right. It's really only after I lose everything. And my parents can't have me either, so
2023-12-29 20:45:49
gpt2:  And so my question is you're going to answer this question when you decide that you want me to. I won't ask what I want to know. But so now what you're asking me is, so you can be like, I'll put
2023-12-29 20:46:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
If you want me to go, please tell me what to do. "
"No," he said. "I won't, I've already told you how this happened." And this time I told him just to just get it over with
2023-12-29 20:46:57
gpt2:  This time, if you want me to go back to the day when I was still a baby, please tell me that if I tell you this, I'll stop you. You're never going to have to come back because you went back to the
2023-12-29 20:47:48
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I need this to go on. You need to let me know what is going on. If it can't, then please let me know and I'll tell you.
Please.
I sighed. I could see the outline of the door to
2023-12-29 20:47:56
gpt2: 
"Don't do it if I don't want you to see me," he said. "I don't know what else I would have done if I hadn't been there." "It's okay, don't say anything I didn't warn
2023-12-29 20:48:02
gpt2:  I don't want to ever make things up that I am not comfortable enough with, to never see that light go out on the island. In fact it will always be there.
A man's voice, so human, makes him an object of
2023-12-29 20:49:05
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'd rather not talk about it because you would understand. So, here's what I'll tell you: I was an asshole to you all this time. No one deserves to be treated like that. It's not fair to be treated like this
2023-12-29 20:49:17
gpt2:  And then I have the problem of having to go all the way back. It's a burden for anyone but myself, so why should it ever be like that? It should never be like this! It's so much harder when I have to fight
2023-12-29 20:49:23
gpt2:  That is where the voice comes into play.
It is a very unique thing with an island. This is where you come into a world where nobody has ever seen, and there are no walls. They are built around you. The island is always
2023-12-29 20:49:31
gpt2:  When you get to the present, what happens? You kind of have to find your own way back. That's what makes her so great. She looks so beautiful again. That's the kind of beauty that comes out. This guy has gotten in
2023-12-29 20:49:38
gpt2:  I was scared of something.
I opened the door for the night and a loud clamor.
It was a familiar noise that had only come from a distant building, and I felt a little dizzy.
But when I opened it,
2023-12-29 20:50:32
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I could lose my life. I couldn't do anything about it. I'm sorry."
"So, I've been a very bad girl and you got to know me better?"
"Yes, I got to know you better."
"
2023-12-29 20:51:26
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I still can't believe you did this."
"So you'll just ignore me? Well what do you think? Should I make the mistake of telling you that I was a baby when I'm younger?"
"It doesn't matter now,
2023-12-29 20:52:15
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  A way to be free. I have no right to live like that. As I grew old and old, I made my decision. A way to escape the world.
The voice grew from it's primitive state and started to sound very strange in
2023-12-29 20:52:26
gpt2:  But I can feel some remorse for the way that I've treated you all. You and I grew apart from each other. You got into bed in our high-rise house. That's all there was to it. You and me, my brother
2023-12-29 20:52:33
gpt2:  It can never be a barrier, and for that I am very grateful.
As well as the game's soundtrack, a small band of friends were on this trip. They were also a little bit of a novelty in that a lot of them had
2023-12-29 20:52:39
gpt2:  Thank you. You and I have always tried to be like that, and we never went against each other. We have always tried to put one's own stamp on each other, but here I was talking about you when I said, "I'm
2023-12-29 20:52:44
gpt2:  I feel quite fortunate and will never know how I got here. You know the rest. There's just such a lot of things that would be better that go wrong. You could have been with my wife or my husband or my children. But it
2023-12-29 20:53:36
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I don't think I could ever explain it to anyone. But I couldn't stop thinking of how much I like you now, and how hard I've got on to you, as you drive us around."
"You don't really know."
2023-12-29 20:54:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The song "My Love," was very well done.
At some point between the songs the girls went out to the boat and began talking amongst themselves. After about 15 minutes the boat was filled to the brim with the sound of laughing. They must
2023-12-29 20:55:23
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was getting used to the sound and I was really glad. I could sense my lover's cock pulsing. My mouth opened to swallow, but I stopped before I could, fearing what the sound would be. My lips closed around his cock and
2023-12-29 20:55:39
gpt2: 

By my next date I was in the mood for a big cumshot, the taste was exquisite and I took my next few pucks in mouthfuls of him. He came as fast as possible when I took the second and third,
2023-12-29 20:55:44
gpt2:  Once. Not in a year. It just happened. It was like this. I kept feeling so happy about the prospect of a cumshot in my mouth. I wouldn't do it again. After months of waiting for that perfect opportunity, my love
2023-12-29 20:55:49
gpt2: 
I was really on my way to giving my boys a good cumshot, the next couple of days they got to take the dick for me, some pussies decided to make a move against me and I was sent back to college in a

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  state of distraction. I was so ready to get a job after that, and start dating again. I made some friends, they offered to help me.
The two weeks of the summer passed slowly, I got lots of time to myself, but
2023-12-29 20:58:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  flash.
It was only a week or so before the end of my first year, then I was back in Texas and had my first family weekend and I was ready. After being taken in by my old man, my new dad and his wife
2023-12-29 20:58:18
gpt2:  "I would just like to thank you so much for what you do for me."
"And I'll never be able to stay still." I chuckled. "When you make me feel that way, I will feel really bad. We're such
2023-12-29 20:58:25
gpt2:  I'm amazed how smooth he gets when he swallows a drop of cum so quickly. I thought that's when I was really wet, and I was surprised that his body's so soft and gentle.

My body was all wet in that
2023-12-29 20:59:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
The three of them took turns sharing some sweet nectar from one another.
The girls began to talk to each other as if nothing was going on. It all started in the middle of a joke between the three of them. It didn't
2023-12-29 20:59:38
gpt2: 
Just like that, he gets his dick up in the air, like a puppy. It's amazing how quick my feet are and how fast I take him in my mouth, giving him the feeling that he really likes it. I can feel him
2023-12-29 21:00:42
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  He was ready to give me the ultimate in head and this was the best I had gotten since the first time we gave each other an orgasm. With a deep grunt, he thrust into my mouth.
My cheeks hollowed, my jaw hurt,
2023-12-29 21:01:41
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Awwww, oh yeah! Go for it baby!" says the bitch, looking at the dick and her pussy.
A few seconds later, the bitch has a big smile on her face, and the bitch started licking her lips and
2023-12-29 21:01:51
gpt2:  That's nice! It's good to hear you!"

He laughs at my gagging.

You will find yourself cumming in the same instant.

His body is more than warm, it's wet.

He is
2023-12-29 21:02:37
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I
know that now. I'll have to get you to kiss me again sometime!
Ohhhhhh! "
He had a very warm mouth on my breast, sucking on my nipple for a
minute or two, and then I felt
2023-12-29 21:02:48
gpt2:  It felt like a huge cock had just shot in the gut of my body. It felt like that I could get no more of this cum in there from my pussy, even though my pussy still wasn't big enough to handle it. So my dick
2023-12-29 21:03:50
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

She takes her dick in hand and starts sliding it slowly in and out of her pussy,
and her moans turn me on even more. I watch as her beautiful blue eyes roll back
in her head, making her look like a
2023-12-29 21:05:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I watch as my tongue slips in and out of her ass as she strokes his dick. The sight of my best friend going up and down on his cock, it's turning me on like never before. She's so wet for me and is so
2023-12-29 21:06:33
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The feeling of a cock in her pussy, just feels so erotic, so good. I feel like I'm getting turned on more and more, I can feel my cock start to swell even more, I can feel my cum rising up from my stomach
2023-12-29 21:07:47
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  She
went in and out of me in long slow strokes. I felt as if her cunt was being
enormously stuffed with cock. I started to moan around his cock. I let
my hand run up and down his shaft.

2023-12-29 21:09:02
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I feel like I'm getting turned on more and more, I can feel my cum rising up from my stomach
.
I slowly opened my eyes, looking up at the ceiling, I blinked in a slow but loud moan.
"Hey!"
2023-12-29 21:09:19
gpt2: 

He's going to cum, cumming so hard I can feel the pleasure

of it being there for a long time.

He keeps running his hands up his butt for dear life.

You can also feel that you

gpt2:  The thought did not come over me as it had last
few days. But I found myself standing a few feet
up the sidewalk on the side of the building I'd never walked to before, the sidewalks
snow, and in the far
2023-12-29 21:10:49
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The thought of being with my best friend is so confusing, there is so much that was missing and now I am getting ready to fuck my best friend again. The thought makes my cock hard and I push the door open, I walk over to the
2023-12-29 21:12:20
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It was exciting my mind. Every now and then my
lips would stop and it would start to feel like more and more
of my teeth were being pulled on his cock. I could feel my
eyes and lips sucking in air. He
2023-12-29 21:12:33
gpt2:  It was the first time I felt fucking pleasure. He grabbed his huge cock and his hand came and I
tried to push it in, but the feeling was out of control. He jerked his big cock hard against my face. He had
2023-12-29 21:12:40
gpt2:  What should have been done to him was in fact done. She was not
in and out of me. As the thought of this suddenly took hold in my mind. It made me very frightened, my mother just wanted
her and me to try
2023-12-29 21:12:46
gpt2:  And yet, when he was done, it was like
my mind was spinning in my head. His face suddenly changed color and it
was almost almost dark. The only light was the dark outline of
him, my heart beating so much that
2023-12-29 21:13:46
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I was now just a dumb slut, a cock slut, who just had to suck some
dick. I couldn't even go into any deep thought when he said this and I
just lost my focus. He was saying something like "
2023-12-29 21:14:55
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

My pussy is pulsating with such
pleasure.

He's trying to make sense out of this whole
situation. My body is like a rubber band around that dick
that he wants to keep pumping in and out of
2023-12-29 21:15:09
gpt2:  I couldn't even go into any deep thought when he said this and I suddenly lost my
experience. Oh my God, I could feel it in my gut. That was the sound from my mind.

My mind was reeling because I
2023-12-29 21:15:21
gpt2: 
I'm just being real.
His hand moved down to the front door and it was open. He was right.
I knew. And it was like I was about to be swept away.
I knew how he felt.
Then
2023-12-29 21:15:32
gpt2:  I lost any reason to get angry at him anymore. I felt this
shrill of his pain as my thoughts continued to explode in my head.
He came back to his feet and grabbed my hard cock with one hand, making me fall on
2023-12-29 21:15:41
gpt2: 

"Well, what are you saying, Kizuna?" I asked.

"No, no. Kizuna's…?"

"Yeah? You are asking where his

life goes?"

"Hmm,
2023-12-29 21:15:50
gpt2:  " I guess that means something I didn't mean when I was lying and it's not
he who is right but I'm still trying to understand now. I wasn't sure if I'd ever stop. When was the last time I felt sad
2023-12-29 21:17:09
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "
"I understand now," I said.
"It's okay sweetheart. Now we can go back to being brothers. Just relax because no matter what happens
you two will never be apart. Now just relax and let me look you
2023-12-29 21:18:30
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I looked down to see that it was now fully hard and throbbing, now that he had come back
around and was holding me up, now I looked into his eyes and saw the determination there. He slowly
slid his hand over
2023-12-29 21:18:48
gpt2:  "You are my friend now baby. Your tears are only for me now. No matter what happens, I will be there for you." He said with his mouth on the back of my hand.
It was the same expression I had seen when
2023-12-29 21:20:30
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Damn it!" he said breaking my concentration. "You're a little big aren't you?"
I nodded and continued to focus. "Let me see you little brother. Now, if you ever
come near me again I will give
2023-12-29 21:21:50
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You're almost as big as you were when we made love that first time!" I said to him and he just
smiled back at me.
My hand moved a little further over to his ass, "You better take
a shower before
2023-12-29 21:22:09
gpt2:  Let the baby go!" he said, but my cock jerked up and my body jerked back.
The boy then hit me with both hands and I was falling to the ground.
"What?!" he asked with a little pained g
2023-12-29 21:23:18
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
As he was standing over me, his lips captured the tip of my throbbing cock and he moved it in
his mouth, sending me over the edge. He sucked harder than ever and swallowed my cum. He wiped his mouth with
the

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "
He stood up and gave me an evil look. "You'll get a spanking. That's how much of an evil
you are!"
I looked at my brother and he did the same. "Ok. You win."

2023-12-29 21:24:40
gpt2:  His body shook and he took me off.
'Please stop,' I screamed
into my chest and I knew I had to stop. I went to the bathroom and I had a few minutes to think.
 'I can't believe it,'
2023-12-29 21:26:13
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Hey, I am your brother. I can do anything I want."
With that he quickly turned and stepped into his room.
"Just one little question for you."
"Sure?"
"How big did you get last week
2023-12-29 21:26:30
gpt2:  Let's go back together!" he said, but my dick stiffened. He kept on pushing me in and out as he got closer. I was trying to do the same thing, but he was too forceful. I was too much, I wasn
2023-12-29 21:26:36
gpt2:  I will let you
do all of my chores, I promise." He gave me a pat on the back and pulled out
the towel which he said in a nice, girlish voice, "You can take it off
so you can walk
2023-12-29 21:26:42
gpt2:  I need to do your
scrub, too. You do better with your clothes off than a pair. It's better off on top if you put them
together or a little bit over here." He laughed. "You're

2023-12-29 21:28:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "I told him, and his face was so red I could almost see his lip." I'm sorry, "he whispered, tears forming in his eyes." I'm sorry, "I yelled." No, "he said, as I heard the

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"No! Please, just tell me." He begged.
So I explained about him being an only child, being on his own, and then I asked him to be at the house to help me put up the fence. He agreed and
2023-12-29 21:29:59
gpt2:  I said I was not doing enough, he would never say that. And he just sat there. He didn't try to come out. And he wouldn't come out. He wasn't a "bad boy" any more."

When I
2023-12-29 21:31:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  He looked nervous and I knew he would be but I couldn't help it. He told me to bring a friend to help him and to take care of the rest. I did, and we had fun.
The next morning, I put up
2023-12-29 21:31:32
gpt2:  He came to my house a few weeks later and tried to convince me I was a good person. I would just say to myself I wasn't doing enough and they would tell me what would happen.
I'm pretty sure he was right. He
2023-12-29 21:32:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "
I told him all about my past experiences and told him what an arrogant asshole he is. He wouldn't
let go and started to kiss me. At first I thought he was only going to kiss me. But he started to kiss me
2023-12-29 21:33:04
gpt2:  I told him he didn't want that in me, and he was afraid he would become a man. I told him, and he said, but that he couldn't give me that. When I asked him how he was going to get out,
2023-12-29 21:34:42
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I told him I didn't want that in him too, and I wasn't going to push it or force him. "I yelled, I looked at him and saw the tears and started to cry. He sat down on the chair next to me
2023-12-29 21:35:53
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "
He walked to the door as well with me on my knees next to him.
He looked at the towel in my hand and smiled at it, "There. There's my baby girl. All
done. Now go shower and then

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
As I told him, "I'm just a woman who is scared. I don't want to give him anything in his heart, and I don't think I can do that in my own life. And I don't want to be a

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  We stood there. For a while. Then he let his hand slide over my ass, cupped my butt and pressed his hand up between my legs. We stayed that way, him not saying anything, just like that. I was beginning to feel
2023-12-29 21:39:36
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  He was a good looking boy, standing up proudly, and then all of a sudden he just stared at me.
"Don't be embarrassed, I'm not gonna tell anyone." He said, and then it just clicked. "How old are
2023-12-29 21:39:52
gpt2:  I'm pregnant."
He took the towel and headed for the kitchen to clean it up. Then, after having gone to the bathroom, he went to his son and told him to clean it up before he gave birth. It looked like the baby
2023-12-29 21:41:02
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Wait here." He said, and then he disappeared into the kitchen.
I turned to look at this beautiful boy walking around in my house. I still didn't know what to make of this, so I just stood there, not thinking about what
2023-12-29 21:41:14
gpt2:  I want to be an I'm a pregnant woman."

There is an irony to that story as well. As I was talking, a male friend of mine in the audience gave me a tour of the family as well as talking about how he
2023-12-29 21:41:23
gpt2:  That's how I got married, I promise you. And I don't have to tell anyone. I am very comfortable with the way God treated me, and I think He loves us. And I'm in love with God.

There's

We don't have a bad marriage. That doesn't mean we don't have some bad relationships. It means

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Here were 2 handsome, innocent young men walking around in my home alone, and the whole thing scared the shit out of me.
They knew what they were doing, and they wanted to help.
I mean, how could I have been so

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
My son Jason was a star athlete, which usually required being physically strong. He is on the football team, and I have a good amount of respect for him. He is an honest, fair, and devoted man. He does not smoke,

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  We're just going to have to find the right time and place so we can just get this over with. Then when I've graduated I will be able to have that money to start getting my house and you'll be just like your Dad and me
2023-12-29 21:46:25
gpt2:  I love you. And I'm happy.

[After a few minutes of singing, the woman behind us grabs my hand and pulls me into bed with her, as I lay naked on the bed next to her.]

2023-12-29 21:46:39
gpt2:  My boyfriend went out with the girls.

He had no choice but to take that moment to get him some things wrong. And then there was this moment he'd heard from somebody who knew him that they were going to give him a hug,
2023-12-29 21:47:57
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  So we didn't have to make a long story short. I was pretty lucky to have an appointment with you.
My doctor tells me that I'm getting very old. It's not unusual for people to have children and then they tell their doctors
2023-12-29 21:49:20
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  All afternoon. But I was feeling bad about not even getting a chance to say 'I love you' after hearing it. At the dinner table, I looked up at the older woman. I was beginning to feel bad about not saying 'I love

gpt2:  But there's just one thing that keeps us moving at night: not being as nice as you are. Which is going to make you happier.

You get this constant feeling that you don't actually like any woman at all, but I know

gpt2: 
There was a time when I just stopped being an older person and made myself a sandwich. I was able to do that before.
My mom said you're supposed to keep it simple. Your food can taste different but you have the freedom to

And then I would stop being an older person and say, 'Okay, so, like, now that you've made this sandwich, you don't want to be an older person anymore.'

2023-12-29 21:50:03
gpt2:  I thought I might have something to say. I couldn't figure out where I was going with this...

[Panting.]

And just as I thought I was done with this story, the woman behind
2023-12-29 21:51:18
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I asked mom what that was and she said we don't want to have to eat like that. I think I was just curious if it would ever come to that. As long as I'm a small kid and my mouth is just fine, how
2023-12-29 21:51:34
gpt2:  I didn't want to give up on my chance, and for the time being I'm happy to have you.' The older woman leaned back on the table, her hair and eyes blacking. I was like 'What?' I started to think I
2023-12-29 21:52:59
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But as a way of showing me that I do want to start living as a woman again, I think I'd better be able to keep it a secret for a couple weeks.

It seems my brain started to make more sense and I stopped

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I'm a grown woman, you have to grow up.
I just felt so guilty, and I was still crying I guess.
My mind was still a mess. I'd forgotten how good it felt when my stomach does that. I
2023-12-29 21:55:47
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm not scared of things I can't handle,
I'm a woman. Just because I can't live on my own doesn't mean I can't have fun, like if you're willing to help I can have some fun.'
I
2023-12-29 21:57:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I did and just kept getting used to it.
In my early 20's I finally saw the beauty of life. I saw the good in life and the good in my job. It was just a matter of time.
Now... the rest

gpt2: 
When you get used to being an old person, there are plenty of options for you. You can have lots of things, be it a sandwich, a cupcake or an album. You can sit on a couch and feel completely normal.

2023-12-29 21:58:40
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The more I kept saying it, the harder I got to say no. But every time I said yes, the harder and harder it got.
The more I said yes, the harder and harder it got. Every time I said no, the

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I won't do it.'
I didn't have any friends who liked girls, or I don't know if anyone liked girls. I didn't know a girl. I didn't know how to date girls. I was a girl and I really

She died and was killed by the police.

He looked back at me and I smiled,
'You were an angel. You don't do that in the middle of the night.'
She gave the nod,
'Now you can live a normal life.'
She laughed again.
2023-12-29 22:02:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You don't
feel so bad now. Now. Take a ride.' He said and he got on his bike, turned left and left and didn't stop for a while. 'Oh. Good night.' I said as he walked away.

2023-12-29 22:03:45
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I think I will take you up on that...'
He smiled back,
'No, I don't think so, no. I am sorry to have ruined it...'
He smiled back and that was the beginning of the final kiss
2023-12-29 22:05:02
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I pulled him down by his cock,
'Now I want to make love to you.'
Then I took him in my mouth and sucked and tongued his dick like the sexy little girl that I was.
'You like that?'
2023-12-29 22:06:16
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
'Why do you say that? I haven't done that in ages.'
He looked down at me, 'I can't believe I am the same as you, now do you want me to make you happy.'
I smiled and turned

"No!" Janet shrieked, clutching the top of the car, "I've had enough! I want nothing more to do with that car! Why would I let it go out of a garage?"

A few moments later
2023-12-29 22:08:18
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  What does it take for you to be happy? I asked.
'Nothing.' He said. 'We have a nice life and a nice home that is where we belong. I have a good job that keeps me out of my parents' houses
2023-12-29 22:08:35
gpt2:  Where is the time?' What does it take for you to be happy for four months?"

She gave him a hard stare and told him that if he was happy for a moment he would think about making something for him. He nodded.

I couldn't believe that she had that kind of power over me, or that she would so

When he turned around and was about to reply, she turned toward the door, and when he turned back, she was standing there
2023-12-29 22:12:50
gpt2:  If you ever want to go to a place where you don't know who you are, then feel free to reach out and say to me, 'Hey, I am Jamiya Nakajima', just like this girl who had no intention of
2023-12-29 22:13:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Thank you, Lexi. You are always so nice to me. I'm very happy that I'm here with you."
"Thank you, Lexi. I love you."
She looked at me and held her head. "
2023-12-29 22:14:31
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  For everything."
"You've been kind to me, Lexi."
"So are you, really. I just don't think of you as someone who loves my ass."
"That was sweet, but no. I've seen what
2023-12-29 22:15:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I never thought of it, but I've really enjoyed the past year."
"Yes, you have. It feels like we haven't met." I replied.
"You mean that you don't love me, Alex? That you don't
2023-12-29 22:15:23
gpt2:  As the years go by, I get more and more desperate to make sure that we can make this a family picture, with Jamiya Nakajima at the top and Jamiya Nakajima in the back."

"Kuhdra
2023-12-29 22:15:29
gpt2:  I think you're a guy who understands what it's like to be a woman in Hollywood. There are times you have to prove that your worth, even if that means telling your girlfriends it's not your fault."
"You're right," he
2023-12-29 22:15:37
gpt2:  I guess not one I have met who doesn't feel like I'm special."
"That's a lie."
"Don't say that too loud. Don't ever say it. Why won't you just tell me a few more things?"
2023-12-29 22:15:44
gpt2:  There are times you have to prove that your worth, even if that means telling your girlfriends it's not your fault. "I like you, but you can't win without your worth. You have to be a woman who is worth nothing to the
2023-12-29 22:16:46
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  And a few days ago he would have just shrugged his shoulders and said "I don't know. But you know how women are."
He gave her a kiss, and they said goodbye as he began to leave.
"Well, I'll
2023-12-29 22:17:41
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Maybe that's not such a good idea?"
She looked at him, worried, and he shook his head.
"Don't be scared about it. We won't be going through anything like you are going through."
"We don't
2023-12-29 22:17:52
gpt2:  I mean we've had more than a couple of women on the bus, you know."
"Yeah, I have the best luck in all of them," she replied, waving her hands toward him.
"And I still don't get to
2023-12-29 22:18:41
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Are you ready?"
"Yes," she smiled, smiling broadly, and then taking his hand, and then led him up the stairs to the second level.
She was still in the bathroom and he smiled, knowing she was about to leave.
2023-12-29 22:18:52
gpt2:  Don't say that out loud." I smirked.
Alex laughed.
"That sounds quite funny, really, so I'm glad to hear that you are quite enthusiastic." She smiled and added.
"I wonder if it's not because
2023-12-29 22:18:57
gpt2:  I need to show you what I've learned this season?"
"Oh, man, you're amazing. I'm starting to think I can't see any of this in you. You keep staring at me like I'm some kind of crazy freak
2023-12-29 22:19:04
gpt2:  I don't need to show you the changes in our team."
She said something else that didn't fit his expectations. "But...we'll see. I'm not going to lie. Just because I didn't know we'd win by a
2023-12-29 22:19:57
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  His smile grew wider as he realized I had noticed.
And he remembered telling her it wasn't right for her to wear that stupid cheerleading uniform, that it was a joke. But I'm a little proud that I knew she wasn't wearing
2023-12-29 22:20:42
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That's the first time I've ever seen the guys give her as much attention as they'd give a woman she'd just met."
"So you're the one not getting his," she teased.
"You're the one who's really
2023-12-29 22:21:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It's too much."
Jill looked out the window at the clouds before her. "Okay... this is the last day on the bus. We've been to three stops and then the last stop. I know you have to get to work
2023-12-29 22:21:33
gpt2:  If you don't it will kill you."
Jill turned around to meet her partner. He smiled brightly. "Alright now then." He placed his hands on Jill's shoulders, as he waited.
"Hey Jill, you need to take
2023-12-29 22:22:17
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But now I am thinking I need to make some changes. I can't just...if we lost I will have to tell everyone. I don't want to do that."
He thought to himself; I'm going to have to tell my mother
2023-12-29 22:23:03
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I think we should have her wear more clothes to school. I want to look like her.
She was always excited for the start of the school year, but now she was not so excited. She'd be looking so much more attractive and at
2023-12-29 22:23:49
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Do you think you're ready to go?"
"As ready as can be. I'm not wearing makeup as well. But there's no point in wasting it. That's why I wear something more professional."
"Right on, I will
2023-12-29 22:24:38
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm sure you'd love to spend some time with your friends as you've done with me. So... I have to ask. Are you going to have some time off?"
"Yeah... I'm taking a few weeks off. I want
2023-12-29 22:25:25
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Oh you're going to have to be more vocal than that.
"Okay but you can only make it so far and it takes a while to get over that. It took us weeks."
"So you won't talk to your mother?"
2023-12-29 22:26:14
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I want to tell you something about a very important girl. I hope you don't mind.
I have this long and thick mane of dark brown hair that I've been giving to you and she's almost as long as my hand!
2023-12-29 22:26:26
gpt2:  How much more?"
"It's not even too late. Our first stop is the first checkpoint. We're about to be back in town and we'll need everyone to be on the same level of effort and coordination. I'm not trying to
2023-12-29 22:27:15
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I have to show her. I won't let this man think I am easy. "
He was silent for a minute, trying to think. Then he spoke: "I was thinking I need to talk to your mother and then maybe you could
2023-12-29 22:27:27
gpt2:  It would be too late then. What if I don't pay you enough? I can't just leave you where I am." She giggled and she gave me a soft smile. He asked how much he was going to pay. "Well...
2023-12-29 22:27:34
gpt2:  I am not afraid of this man or anyone I care about. He will love me and I am afraid that I will not be able to be there with him again. It was very unpleasant in the first place."
"Okay." He pulled the
2023-12-29 22:28:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  We'll need to have someone on the first checkpoint. We're still running a few hours late. They've got us up into the night, but I'm sure they'll be able to get us back in as well. I just want to have
2023-12-29 22:29:03
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  My friends can just get to first, but you're not leaving until I give your permission."
The two of them started talking, talking of various topics, with the man beside them whispering. It became clear that if this group was successful, the
2023-12-29 22:29:13
gpt2:  I mean, there were two in total, but they're not going to need to be much on the first two. I need to see them on that first checkpoint."
"Alright... I'll let you know, alright?"
"Alright."
2023-12-29 22:29:18
gpt2:  With the way the man got in and out of the house, the next few months would be extremely difficult. It would be very important for you, as well.
I could feel my heart breaking, as if my heart is beating like hot co
2023-12-29 22:29:23
gpt2: 
If you want to come and see me, go to my house and I'll give you my first blow job. It's not going to hurt, but we'll have to do it.
Do you really think I like this place? It
2023-12-29 22:29:28
gpt2: 
I will not lie. But we are both from different countries and we are fighting at different levels of the government. In Japan, I became a little girl when I was about thirteen years old. It seemed to happen very easily with no warning,
2023-12-29 22:30:15
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  She will want your cock, so it will be okay to fuck her while I'm holding you and eating you. She wants your cum, so she'll let you cum in her mouth. Then she will let you pull your cock out and do it
2023-12-29 22:31:06
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I have no idea how I was going to talk to someone about this. It was going to be a very hard conversation.
First of all, I need to tell you that I don't get to see her. But after I've known her
2023-12-29 22:31:58
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Then, while my own cock is still hard, it will help me get through that day.
I can't believe you are going to do this for me. I've never cheated on you. No matter what I want, no matter how I
2023-12-29 22:32:05
gpt2: 

Now, the most important part of this night is you, this slut, and her family. And I can't tell you how happy you are for all of us to see that you don't have to go back home to get your pussy
2023-12-29 22:32:56
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  We all sat for a while about the next night's game.
"Well, in a couple of days, the first two games should be played in front of a crowd of thousands," I told all. "But I'll ask one team to
2023-12-29 22:33:38
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I kept telling myself to forget this ever happened, if I could. It had been a total charade.
This was my first season at the university and I thought of my future. I was so scared I could feel my heart pounding.
2023-12-29 22:34:18
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  They were all horny but I was the last guy to cum, so it was a little rough. My heart skipped a beat as I saw the woman that had the biggest tits on the court at the game.
"I just took a shower,
2023-12-29 22:35:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That's when I saw my mother talking to my brother, and that was what brought me out of my funk. I didn't want to believe that my mother would be a total bitch, and it wasn't fair. I wanted her to be there
2023-12-29 22:35:18
gpt2: 
My heart goes out to her, I want to see how she reacts. All these years and then I get so upset, how I don't know what to do
I start crying and she says, "Why was your dad?"
I
2023-12-29 22:35:23
gpt2:  All these years and then I get so upset, how I don't know what to do.
As soon as I open my eyes I feel my father on a plate, I take a photo with my mother, and it's all me and mine
2023-12-29 22:36:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
But I know I can't do this. I know if you give me the opportunity again, I'll do anything I need to. I know that is all I'll let myself feel.
But I can't. Not now, not while
2023-12-29 22:36:22
gpt2:  I go, "Oh that's so awful, you're so stupid!"
I started to cry. I know she is crying but I know she wasn't crying at all and I know the anger I have
I go and she asks how she
2023-12-29 22:37:11
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  My mother knows I have all sorts of thoughts, I know how much I want to have intercourse with you, and
I know I want to tell your mother that I want to. And you know that you'd probably make that very clear to her
2023-12-29 22:38:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I know, I know, that is a complete lie but I cannot help it. I know how much she would like to have sex with you. I
know I want to say what a whore and selfish whore you are but I can't.
2023-12-29 22:38:18
gpt2:  My brother
I want to make him love me so much that I am happy to fuck you right now. But there is nothing I could have said about your
I could not say what you would have wanted to tell me, for me
I
2023-12-29 22:38:23
gpt2:  I tell him I hope I can be with her as soon as I can so I'll never, ever want to fuck him like she wants to be with me.
When we get the chance, we will get to love each other like we wanted
2023-12-29 22:39:14
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
My hand goes to his chest I can see a look of lust on his face.
It's a hot sight. My brothers
I don't know how to put it on a scale. I don't know, my brother. All I
2023-12-29 22:39:25
gpt2:  We want to fuck each other the way our fathers love him. We want him to get it with us. I know you think I can be with him, but it's very clear from the moment I meet him that I do not.
I
2023-12-29 22:39:30
gpt2: 
"No more. Don't cum, leave me there with your sister. No more. No more, no more. Don't cum again. I'm dead."
"N-no, no longer."
I'd feel sick if I
2023-12-29 22:39:35
gpt2:  No, I think it's for you." I have met so many of you. My brother was an All American quarterback, so he can't be too fond of me anymore. He still loves my dad. My brother and I never had that awkward
2023-12-29 22:39:40
gpt2:  I am just as sorry as the man with the bad ass cologne said she is going to stop. Just as sorry as he. You know his wife
She's in a great hurry, and she can hardly get up. And I don't
2023-12-29 22:39:44
gpt2: 
"The man with the bad ass cologne doesn't look like she really likes him. She looks so unkind and kind. She never seemed like she'd enjoy sex. She didn't like sex as much as I had, and we did
2023-12-29 22:39:49
gpt2:  I understand her disappointment.
You know how you feel about being a pussy. I feel sorry for you too.
You're such a pussy. Fuck me, I would love to be with you for a while. You're so fucking handsome,
2023-12-29 22:40:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I thought you would like me to do it, you know I just can't
Because that would be cheating.
No it wouldn't,
Because I just can't do it. And if you were to think about it,
You
2023-12-29 22:40:33
gpt2:  You said I would take her away? But that's no way I wouldn't stop. I'm trying to keep my promise. And I'm not allowed to stop. I can't see her being upset. I could see her looking at me very
2023-12-29 22:40:38
gpt2:  And he's just not here to be with me anymore. (Laughter.)

As for what happened the night he sent her to college, and the way he did it, the "exceptions" did not even come across as "ex
2023-12-29 22:40:42
gpt2:  No? Who says it doesn't come with the baggage of being like you're not that boy but like you're just like I'm your family? My dad is so tough to meet. I think I'm going to make the same decision, it
2023-12-29 22:41:22
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Or am I, "I started, but Jake stopped me when he saw how much I was crying.

"We are both sorry Jake. I shouldn't have treated you like that." I said. "I thought I loved you more than
2023-12-29 22:42:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  No! I couldn't see what was happening, but I could see that I was moving faster. I can feel her fingers grabbing me, rubbing me faster. You're not thinking straight are you? Her thumb is now rubbing my back, making me
2023-12-29 22:42:19
gpt2:  But I can tell you how much I hurt her! You know how big she's got! No, I mean she's so big that her tits are gonna take my breath away! But my brother didn't mean it! He said it to scare
2023-12-29 22:43:11
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I couldn't concentrate. My legs were shaking and I could feel my face starting to flush. She must be teasing me with her fingers. I can feel the heat building up in my body. The feeling is so new. Her touch is so
2023-12-29 22:44:07
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
"Mmmmm, oh yes." she whispers in my ear, "You're such a good little slut, aren't you baby? You're almost there now, aren't you?" she asked me with a grin, and I felt her other
2023-12-29 22:45:00
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I told you so before I even met you. I've lost all track of time. "

Jake put his arm around me and gave me a hug. "I don't know what to say to make you feel better. It's hard
2023-12-29 22:45:11
gpt2:  So, it's going to be good. So yeah, now we're going to sit down and talk about the next few years. I don't think you've seen my family the whole time. I mean, there are moments where you're not
2023-12-29 22:46:24
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

"I didn't know you could do that," you said.

"You are amazing," I told her.

"I can't believe I'm actually doing this, this is soooo hard". She is now rubbing
2023-12-29 22:47:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  (Laughter.)
"You never know."
"Thanks, I love you, I don't know what's going on, it's kind of hard to be here, right now. He's right out there. We should talk
"
2023-12-29 22:47:29
gpt2:  I think so. It's cool. Let me make it up for a day. A lot of people ask, "No, I know you were a little bit rough. I mean that, but you have no fucking problem being like you are."
2023-12-29 22:48:16
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm gonna do anything if she'll let me fuck her."
"Why would you do that" I asked. I was trying to figure it out.
"Just fuck her, we're brothers and we've always been close. That was
2023-12-29 22:48:26
gpt2: 


She laughed and kissed my forehead, and when we settled in she sat down on the edge of a table next to me, and pulled out a little knife.


"You okay," I whispered, with a grin on my face.
2023-12-29 22:48:32
gpt2:  I had just caught my breath. She had so many things to say about me, but to me it was just a cute little thing of the past couple of years. She had never felt like she was as alone as I had, but the fact
2023-12-29 22:48:37
gpt2:  I asked her to lay it over mine, so that we would not look and cry, and we did. She said something about the day when she didn't want to believe that I was dead and all, but she felt that I was living.
2023-12-29 22:49:30
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Her finger stopped and she started again, but again, I was unable to move any of my limbs, and I was just watching my own finger disappear from her fingers, and then she would stop. It was not an excruciating, but excruciatingly pleas
2023-12-29 22:49:41
gpt2:  But yeah, I think one thing about me as a parent and as a writer is that you don't just have to do this. And there are times that it can be something that you work on that you may not have thought you could do.
2023-12-29 22:49:48
gpt2:  As a writer you have to write. I went from one of the last writers to a member of the Board of Directors of the C. L. C. and had to move around. I mean, it was pretty hard but that was all the
2023-12-29 22:49:54
gpt2:  And there are times that it can be something that you work on that you may not have thought you could do. But yeah, I think one of the very best things about me as a parent in my reading is that when I look at myself and
2023-12-29 22:50:47
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  For me, that might have been the last thing I did, since I am a guy and the first thing I could ever think of doing when I thought I would be able to have my hand moved over my own skin was for my thumb to touch
2023-12-29 22:50:58
gpt2:  But yeah, I think one of the very best things about me as a parent in my reading is that when I look at myself and read on the Internet and I remember all the horrible things that my sister did, and I think in the future I
2023-12-29 22:52:08
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  hope to read on the Internet the worst thing that happened to her, and I think in the future, I hope to read on the Internet on the worst kind of level.
And so that was just the kind of thing that I thought of when
2023-12-29 22:52:18
gpt2:  could have written about it, I think we could be very well informed and very able to understand what it was that had caused me to feel vulnerable and how it could be taken away from me. When my sister was like eight years old I didn't
2023-12-29 22:52:25
gpt2:  but she said something to me that I do not remember.

So, this isn't to say that my memory in my memory would change. It might get clearer a little. As you will see, it did not come from my memory and
2023-12-29 22:53:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

I was 18 and there I was at a party, one I would remember. I have been alone most of my life, because every time I think of people seeing me, I feel a wave of shame, guilt and guilt.


2023-12-29 22:54:21
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  It was a party where my sister and I had a few drinks and she had a few more, after which she had gotten herself a bottle of vodka and some coke. I stood there and watched for a while with a big smile on my face
2023-12-29 22:54:31
gpt2:  I sat there talking to friends about what it was like. I was the only one with friends, and I always knew that I needed to come out of there and to have fun. I remember sitting there thinking I was going to come out of this
2023-12-29 22:54:36
gpt2:  It was really hard being part of that.

And so, back to the issue of how I felt on a team. I'm always open to other ways to express my views. Because that's how you organize your team, the way you
2023-12-29 22:54:40
gpt2:  And I was saying to them, 'How can I do something that's just so fun and funny for me, I feel like I could be that.'"

Baldwin says it's hard not to feel guilty when the kids you love are
2023-12-29 22:54:45
gpt2:  It's like 'Hey, I'm like an old lady, what's going on?' 'Oh, maybe I've just lost. You know what? I've come a long way. You got to change. I'm happy to do all the
2023-12-29 22:54:49
gpt2:  I have no need to look into my parents, or my parents. I just feel like all I want to do is enjoy my life and try to be a success'."

As for her story as a child, a father tells her, "
2023-12-29 22:54:54
gpt2: 
And so then when we got out of college, we were just like, oh wow.
When I was younger we just had really great friendships with people that weren't like our parents.
I've never known these two to be like this

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I was still in high school, and I had been going to school in the suburbs. I was a sophomore and my name was not on the roster for the school and was not the captain of the football team. I also was not in my
2023-12-29 22:56:41
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  My folks had been the only people home when I had moved in and I had not been there very long. I had graduated from high school when I had last seen them and I was back in the area now.
Now I had seen my sister
2023-12-29 22:56:50
gpt2:  We came back around this time and we came back on April 1, 1993, around 8am. We had been in a van going around for about 5 minutes and I kept saying 'This is not going to end anytime soon.' We got off the
2023-12-29 22:57:36
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  We still haven't made our move.' Well, that was really good of her. It didn't seem so bad that we had already come this far and she hadn't really been done making our move yet. Maybe 'it' had changed and was
2023-12-29 22:58:20
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

It had been so long. I had really thought my life was never going to change again.

And yet, here I was. I wasn't even on a plane at the airport. No, I was at the airport in a
2023-12-29 22:58:29
gpt2:  What would happen, I'm sure it would still be there, it could just be that. But after that moment, I lost my focus a little bit. I really don't know how long I'll stay focused on it any more. It's
2023-12-29 22:59:11
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That was two years.

But not to worry. We could go again.

What did the "two years" mean?

So I made up some bullshit about wanting to be with other men because we had lost our sexual appetite
2023-12-29 22:59:21
gpt2: 

That was not as big of a deal as it seemed, I was just tired of watching a lot of crap go around about "the same old stuff." But I had to let him decide if we wanted anything bigger.

If we
2023-12-29 22:59:27
gpt2: 

Do you have memories of that time?

No.

I would know.

When you went to university after that college graduation, did you talk to anybody?

I actually talked to a few people. I just
2023-12-29 23:00:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Would you like to know? Yes? I really would like to know. Do you mind if I use my real name? Yes. Okay. What are you going to do? Do you want a nice dinner with my friends at mine? What do
2023-12-29 23:00:30
gpt2: 

I don't have. I have no, I have no memory. I had a lot of different friends and I loved to read the books that came out.

Was it hard to talk to you about what people like to read?
2023-12-29 23:00:36
gpt2: 

The reason was I wasn't the smartest person in the class.

Did that make you decide that you wanted to come back to college and become a teacher?

No. I didn't know what would happen when you graduated and
2023-12-29 23:01:23
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  This isn't like my brain is an active activity system. It's not an active activity system.

For what that means for me, I don't really know. It's the way I'm supposed to think right now, this isn't
2023-12-29 23:01:33
gpt2:  Your first choice was me. Please let's check it out! Please, I was a really nice friend at my first place, I remember the first time I ate a roast-off-of-a-barrel, I was always so funny
2023-12-29 23:02:21
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was in a room with two guys who were talking to each other and one of them was shaking my hand. His name was Ryan and he told me that I was going to do a job for him. He told me to strip down to a
2023-12-29 23:02:32
gpt2:  So it started a bit more than my eye would take me. But I took that moment and just kept on thinking about things I needed to focus on.

CK: You were working with Michael Gira, who you were supposed to be
2023-12-29 23:02:39
gpt2: 

I remember a conversation in our class with one teacher about having to learn English. The guy who was giving me an earful made a joke about how the kids looked like I'm playing for the Yankees.

I started telling him I
2023-12-29 23:02:45
gpt2:  It was about her trying to read an English textbook on English to a class of students. We were discussing a recent discussion of the language. So we had to talk about some subjects.

Do you believe I must be writing an article based upon
2023-12-29 23:02:52
gpt2: 

"I'm not doing it," he said.

"Well, I'm sure you're. I don't. I would make your point as well.

I mean, if someone says they're using Spanish and then says
2023-12-29 23:02:58
gpt2: 

He then added, "Oh, my God, look at that one."

While I was listening to the lecture, I was thinking of my life at the time, as opposed to when my mom did it. The same kid had
2023-12-29 23:03:49
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "I love to read."

"Really? You love to read? I bet you can read pretty good."

"I can," he sighed.

"Then why don't you tell me about yourself," I said.

2023-12-29 23:04:34
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You are amazing. So good."
I replied, "Yeah, so good!" Then as I leaned forward I asked, "Would you take your time?"

"Oh yeah, but only for about half an hour. That's what they
2023-12-29 23:05:13
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm a writer."

"A writer?" I said, and my heart fluttered a bit.

"Sometimes, my stories are more explicit than most things out there."

"Ohhh, my gawd!" I
2023-12-29 23:05:50
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I was shocked and I asked where I would do that. Ryan said, it's a show and tell, and he'd pay me." I was stunned by my own answer. "And if you do this, I'll pay you a lot more
2023-12-29 23:05:59
gpt2:  That's just not true. Because there's no other way. So what's the difference between being a writer and being a human being?"

Then, in the same breath, she pointed at the way the current Mexican media and politicians are attacking
2023-12-29 23:06:38
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I'm not going to pay you any money for your work. It's not just about the work, it's about my own work." I replied, "I'm not sure I want to do this."
"Oh come on, this is
2023-12-29 23:07:16
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Then there's also the way that they say: "I don't know!"

"I know!" he said, his voice rising. He turned to face me. His eyes were sparkling with excitement, his expression was one of surprise. "
2023-12-29 23:07:56
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Not English!"

And if one of them says 'It's English!'

Well then that's even worse.

Well, maybe I could get them to stop saying it. We'll have plenty of time for that later. I
2023-12-29 23:08:59
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Oh geez! If you could you would know."
I asked, "If you were going to leave here I can come help you."

She replied, "But of course I would." Then I said, "What if you would
2023-12-29 23:09:06
gpt2:  I can't say I like this crap!" He laughed at that, then he took my hand and rubbed it over my head, looking at me with a puzzled look. "Don't worry about it. I've got you covered. I don't
2023-12-29 23:09:44
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That one made me blush. I can't believe I was suggesting that I like reading. Wow!

"Well, my friend Mike is a teacher, and we meet and go to church together, then he teaches for awhile and lets me go
2023-12-29 23:09:53
gpt2:  When I told you that I'd take you for a date, you were like, 'No,' " my father told me. "I didn't like that. You had been a very good boy, but when you told me that I could have
2023-12-29 23:09:58
gpt2: 

"What did the first name mean to me?" asked the daughter, laughing, sitting on my lap.

"Well, I don't remember, so I don't know. What I heard was in my room, in my room
2023-12-29 23:10:38
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Don't you want your name to last for long? "I asked, and she smiled.

Her voice sounded like an old fog telling her, "I'm a girl, a girl who loves her body. A man would like to be
2023-12-29 23:11:21
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

She said "That I have found a good friend with benefits. He knows the one I am looking for."

I said, "Well I don't know."

She replied, "I'm very happy to hear this.
2023-12-29 23:12:05
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "
"OK..." I replied

She smiled. "Come on, let's go!"
They walked a short distance and to the car seat of the Ford Edge they sat beside me. She picked up her cell phone and dialed.
2023-12-29 23:12:46
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  If we have a good time we should do this more often."

Oh my God, did you just say 'More often' and 'More often' at the same time? And if they say 'More frequently'... well you can't
2023-12-29 23:13:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  No one here would mind if you did."

I nodded, not really sure what to do next. "I don't know why I said that I'd be your wife if I had a good time with you."

She smiled and
2023-12-29 23:13:35
gpt2:  Because that's what we say when I'm playing the guitar."

"I was about to say 'You want to play this?' because I had come home from class and a few months earlier had come home from work and I found my piano
2023-12-29 23:13:39
gpt2: 

"Call you to do some work, OK?" I asked.

"Yeah?" She said while holding up the white wire of the phone. "We're not very good friends. Don't think too much about it."


2023-12-29 23:13:44
gpt2:  No, wait, the reason I don't play guitars is that she can't keep a clean record. At some point she's been given a bad record. Or, at the very least, she's been given to work on what she needs to
2023-12-29 23:13:48
gpt2:  And the record company was like, 'Do you feel sorry for yourself?' "

There are a lot of questions about the way D'Angelo is playing now, but I don't believe his life or career is in question. He's got

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

"Why not?" I asked.

"Because, she's a total bitch. She is an absolute bitch. If I call you to do any work, she says that your name is on the bill. That you have to do
2023-12-29 23:15:27
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You know it's probably not what you expected." She winked, "But I want to try. It's really nice being with you right now."

"Really?" I asked, still somewhat confused.

"Yeah, I'm
2023-12-29 23:15:37
gpt2:  Why call on your parents right now and tell them what to do?"

"I think I do," says Alba, "but then we have to talk about them being too quiet sometimes."

I don't know.

And
2023-12-29 23:15:42
gpt2:  So I'll ask her before it changes. I'm gonna keep saying that we'll get along pretty good.

The room just went from quiet to silent.

[F4M][F4M] [F4] [F
2023-12-29 23:16:29
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You can't do that. And, she will do whatever you tell her to do."

I didn't answer. I just did my work. I had the bill.

"Why not?" I asked again.

"Because
2023-12-29 23:16:37
gpt2:  Just make us your little friends, OK?" She winked and said, "Or just try something completely different. Or just try something completely new, too."

"So what?" I asked, not knowing if I would answer.


2023-12-29 23:16:43
gpt2: 

You can't do that.

And no matter how much you ask, what if your parents, who already knew everything about your mother's mother, still didn't say anything?

And then you won't talk, you know
2023-12-29 23:17:33
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  You can't touch her, or be touched. If your name is on the bill, she will ask why you are doing it. She will even punish you for not doing

It's pretty cruel, isn't it?" she asked. "
2023-12-29 23:18:28
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  Don't talk in the dark.

[F4M][F4M] [F4] [F] [F]

I felt my body get warmer around her.

[F4M][F4M]
2023-12-29 23:19:10
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I didn't want to wake up you.]

[F Don't say anything. I have something for you that'll make you feel like you didn't wake up. You'll sleep better that way.]

[F F4 M]
2023-12-29 23:19:18
gpt2:  You know, if you get too close, she'll get upset and just go on about you. And she said that you know this woman has to do some work. So when she calls you, you are like, 'Oh no.' It's
2023-12-29 23:19:24
gpt2:  You never told her how much it hurts. She just doesn't know. She always just won't let you in and tell her that something's bothering her, and that she isn't a good person. You're not even her partner, you know
2023-12-29 23:20:13
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But if you get enough distance between you and her, she'll leave. So, unless she really needs to go somewhere, she will leave."

"You think she doesn't do that to you?"

She chuckled. "Oh,
2023-12-29 23:20:59
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  That's when you go and talk to her and she's not very pleasant.
I don't care what she says to you. You don't need to know it for yourself. And she has to put up with you because you're the only
2023-12-29 23:21:54
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

This is just not a good idea.

You try to block out all the details.

How can you make her leave?

How can you tell her that I love her? That I'm a part of her life
2023-12-29 23:22:40
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  "

"No. We can never just ignore the whole thing. It's not going to get any easier."

"Look, I get that it may take a while. I was there for a long time. And then, you
2023-12-29 23:23:30
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

And in a million years, I won't get to tell you who you can sleep with, because of the way you'll never have to worry about whether you know who you're sleeping with.

No, there are only so many
2023-12-29 23:24:24
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  But you can know, you have to, and then you can't touch her. Because she knows you know who you are sleeping with. And no matter what, she'll know you know about them, and your parents will know that you know who
2023-12-29 23:25:21
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  The only thing you could say about her is that she's a whore.

There's so much more, all of the details come back to you, and so much more

I've seen you in the living room, and your daughter
2023-12-29 23:26:12
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

Your mind is swimming with all these emotions, it's almost as if she's a total mess. You know you should never, ever let this happen.

You make your decision and run out of there.

You get out
2023-12-29 23:26:22
gpt2:  And that's what she does. She calls you in two minutes, and if you don't tell her, she'll scream so hard.

So now, you can tell her that when you don't tell her that you're her whore,
2023-12-29 23:27:19
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus:  I don't know if she knows it, but you guys are... boyfriend/girlfriend. She gets along with you a lot and she loves you.
What do you mean? We're not boyfriend/girlfriend. We're only friends.
You
2023-12-29 23:27:28
gpt2:  You take them off.

What did I want to show you?

Because, you know, your parents would not want you to know what they saw in your mind. Your thoughts. Your thoughts about. You know what would make the

KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 
I mean, I mean, we don't do anything like you guys... do.
She lets her blouse go and gives me the most amazing big hug. I don't know about anyone but I'm proud of how beautiful and tight she
2023-12-29 23:29:03
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

This is why you want me to stop.

You didn't want me to say that. But I did.

You would only want us to take off everything. Nothing that only one part of your brain could comprehend.

2023-12-29 23:29:49
KoboldAI/OPT-350M-Erebus: 

This is why you want me to stop.

It's a lie; you don't want me to stop.

Why would you want me to stop?


This is why you want me to stop.
