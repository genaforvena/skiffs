While some may want to limit this practice, others will say it is necessary to allow the user to control the amount of time the website spends there as opposed to allowing the user to interact with their site. Such a restriction is not to do away with the fact that it is part of the existing legal structure that the user must follow its own rules and ensure that he or she does not abuse a site if that site uses an illegal or unauthorized service.
