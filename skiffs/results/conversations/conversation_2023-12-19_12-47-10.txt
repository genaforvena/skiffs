"I don't think so," he continued.

"Don't think so, Miss Taylor."

"Very well. But the last thing I want to discuss now is how to best protect her when the situation changes, and she is obviously frightened from this."

"I see," Taylor looked up at him, a smirk upon her face.

"Well, I think it is your idea," he said, and looked up at me.

gpt2:  A very well crafted... I hope this isn't the case, as it does not explain why......but it does. It's kind of funny how a woman with a good head would choose a person who looked like the guy who was having an affair. And for that reason, I would say yes or no. The guy may think that's too obvious, because he's seen all the women he would have liked, but it was far easier to see the women more clearly. He even started looking at the women more clearly when they had sex. Maybe he liked them better for the relationship to develop... I wonder if people want to see that? But really? So she would get his eye off and he wouldn't get hurt??
