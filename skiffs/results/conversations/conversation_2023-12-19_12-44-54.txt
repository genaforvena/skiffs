This game was an awful mistake. It wasn't as good, but it was a hell of a good game. The art and graphics were just awful, especially when compared to the games I've played. I was blown away by how well the game handled enemies in a manner similar to the real world. As stated in the review, the game didn't really come into it. It has a strong story, a cool theme and puzzles, but at the same time it feels like it was just left off of the box. I think they're trying to go for the best looking game of 2011, but it's actually pretty darn good?

I'm just a kid trying to learn about math. I don't know what people think about math. I know what the students think about math.

I don't know if I'd even put the word "math" in the newspaper.

That's how people respond when they hear, "oh my god, how dare you!"

I try to explain what I think or what is going on. I sometimes respond with "yes, I see how this stuff works and I'd like to say something, but I'm just trying to get you to admit I'm stupid."

I want to talk about my theory on why it all works. I want to give you my thoughts. I want to explain?

Why do you think you would do this?


Because, we should see you.


It's not just the ones that like to do this to us. We want to see you. You can do more than your dad would.


That's awesome.


Why would you do it to us?


I just told you to start planning your marriage. You should have a great time together. You're probably still working. This one is really serious. What if we both get married? Will you ever get married? That would be a really nice thing to do, since you're going to love us together. Why would you even take a job on this one if it's serious?

So?
