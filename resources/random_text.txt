It is evening, some around 9. She comes back home with groceries. She locks the door. She puts the safe lock on. She checks the peephole. She puts groceries on the kitchen table. She sighs noisily. 

She goes to the living room. She calls her mom. “Hello!” she says and speaks in short cuts “I’m doing great! ------ Yeah, the house is great, they helped me, yes. ------Yeah, learning the language, we have free classes at work, starting in the month. ------Yeah, mom, I’m eating fine. I’m cooking! Mom! Please! ------- I’m in a different country, not in prison or dead! Stop worrying like that! I'm an adult (she pronounces this word slowly, repeats letter by letter) I want to live. I will stop answering your calls if you won’t stop these stupid questions! ------ Yes, I know that I’m calling you, I’m talking about usual stuff, not this boring “are you pooping fine” type of questions, ma!”. She cries the last words and makes a lemon eating person’s face and takes the phone off her ear. Mom’s voice continues in an apologetic tone. Mom’s voice stops. She puts the phone back to her ear, sights loudly and listens to a long pause. “It is all good, mom, really! I’m sorry I was so angry and grumpy with you, ma. You know that I hate when you question my maturity, ma. Yeah, I know that I’m your only daughter! Don’t you worry so much! It is a nice city, nice country! I’m going to learn a language soon. Work is great, nice people. I don’t really have to go there, really. New times, ma. I work from home. This is how it’s called. Yeah, you wanna amazon prime for free? Ma? They give it for free for friends and family! ------ Love you too, ma! ----- Yeah, Borders are closed still, but I hope to see you soon! Love you!”

She comes back to the kitchen, opens the laptop, checks work emails, watches cats, another mlm scam, protests in belarus. She reaches for a cigarette pack. She takes the last cigarette out, lights it up, stares at the laptop. The video shows a girl dragged by a policeman. She watches for some time, sighs, sighs and slams the laptop closed, stands up, cigarette in her mouth. She verifies the cigarette pack - still empty. She goes to the hallway, puts the jacket on, goes to the door. She unlocks the safe lock and tries the door handle. The door does not go. She sighs, steps back, sighs again. She steps to the door, tries the lock once again. Still no. She fishes for the key in her pocket, finds it, takes it out. She puts it in the lock and tries to turn it. She can not turn the key the right way, but it goes one the other way and stuck. She tries to turn it back or take it out, but it stuck. She sighs loudly, takes the jacket off, sits down at the door. 

She calls the landlord. Long beeps. She goes back to the laptop, opens it, googles locksmith. Calls the first one. Long beeps. She calls again. The voice answers in german. “Hello, Locksmith?” - they voice on the other side speaks in german - “I don’t speak German, sorry!” - the voice continues in german. “I don’t understand you! I’m locked. My address …” - the voice speaks louder in german. It sounds seemingly aggressive now. She waits. The voice stops too. “I don’t speak german...” she tries to say, the voice picks up the aggressive german rant. The voice acquired new tones of annoyance. She drops the call. She sighs noisily. She reaches for the pack of cigarettes. It is empty. She bangs her hand on the table, breathes. She takes the longest cigarette butt from the ashray, puts it in her mouth and lights it up. Smoking the last puffs she calls another locksmith. They speak english and it is regular talk that goes well. “So what’s the price?” - the answer - “350? I’m so sorry, it seems too much for me… ----- ah it’s night price? It will be 50 if I call tomorrow during the day? You say you would wait? Hmm okey okey. So I’ll call you in the morning then? Alright, thank you” - she hangs the phone, finishes the cigarette butt. She plays the video back on. She sees the protester (a girl) being dragged into the police car.

She spends the rest of the evening reading Kafka in the bed. A candle burns near the bedhead.

It is morning. She wakes up. She passes the hallway, the door, not noticing the key in the door, ignoring it. In the kitchen she comes back to morning news (new protests, new casualties, new beatings). She sips her morning coffee and leans to grab a cigarette. The pack is not even there. She remembers, rushes to the door. The key is still in the door. She is upset, but not really. She calls the landlord and hears long beeps again. Next she calls the english speaking locksmith. “Yeah, ok, that’s ok. --- Today?” she asks the phone, her face is radiant with a smile. “Yeah, I’m home all day” she cries accidentally vexed with the stupid question, sights, her hand moving to her head, smiles and, her hand cover mouth, giggles. “Ok. Thank you so much! I’ll be waiting”. She tries the key again. It  stuck same as yesterday. But she smiles and goes back to the kitchen and protests videos.

Somebody bangs on the door. She rushes to the door, snuggles to the peephole. She sees a man or woman, it is not clear. The person wears a minotaur head mask. The mask stares at the peephole back. The person as if feeling her stare steps back one step, turns around and goes up the stairs. “Berlin” she whispers to herself, turning back from the peephole, coming back to work.

“It is 6 already! Nobody came!” - She utters to the long beeps at the locksmith’s, pronounces words slowly, irritated with waiting. She sits in the kitchen in the chair. An open notebook lays in front of her, scribbled with her hand paintings. They collide in a sort of maze. She scribbles the maze more. Calls again. The answering machine back again. She records the message:  “I’m sorry, It is a girl from Flughafenstrasse 24. I don’t really wanna sound rude or anything, but I’m locked in my house, I can not go anywhere, YOU already collected my money (my bank sent my notification) and promised me that the locksmith will come here today. It is 6! Where is he?”. She goes to living room and lays on the couch reading Kafka.

Next day’s morning. She calls the locksmith. No answer. Her eyes look at the ceiling while it rings. When the voice said that there is no one and she can record a message. She says “Listen, it is J, I’m calling to verify my appointment. The locksmith is coming today? I’m worried and it’s the third day I’m locked. Please call me back! My number is ….” She swears to herself, goes to the kitchen and puts the electric kettle on, opens the laptop, takes a deep breath. Today is monday. At 11-30 she joins an online work meeting. She mentions that she can not get out of the house. Colleagues laugh amiably at it. One of their voices says “Oh same happened to my friend! His nephew locked himself on the christmas week and stayed locked for a whole week. Luckily he had food and stuff. It’ll all be fine. It’s Berlin, it’s stupid lazy and slow here. Are you not starving?” the voice asked jokingly. The talk relaxed her, she smiled at the story and when the voice asked she said “Yeah, I went grocery shopping right before I locked myself, don’t worry.” “Oh have you heard about these masked guys sneaking around malls?” says an energetic voice. A child’s cry interrupts, continues for some time. A female voice says “Sorry”, she hears the sound of a muted mic. The talk moves on to work. Her phone rings with a message. It says that the locksmith’s coming in 3 hours, stay at home.

She cooks and waits for the locksmith. She calls them a couple times more. Still no answer. She looks up other locksmiths. She calls one, another, no answer anywhere. The 10th answered. They speak german. She rushes to the laptop, translates “I’m locked, my address is”, puts the phone closer to the laptop, she presses play, the computer voice says the phrase in german. She adds the address by herself. The voice on the other side ignores, continues, does not hear, does not understand. She presses the button again. The voices exchange german phrases without interruptions, ignoring one another. She screams something similar to a sought-for german phrase to the phone mic. No change. The voice on the other side repeats the same phrase over and over, she hears that now, calmed down a bit. She listens to the voice for a minute, holding the phone tight to her ear. She hangs up. She tries to call more. No answer, anywhere. She calls the english locksmith to hear the invitation to leave a message. She does that. She says “Pleeease, I’m locked here, you’ve promised to come, but you haven’t come, I’m locked”. 

It is evening. She paces around the kitchen. Two steps, turn around, two steps. She rubs her hands. She cries “AHHHHH” suddenly. She runs to the bathroom, puts off bottles, toothpastes, toothbrushes, 6 rolls of toilet paper to free up the window. She opens the narrow window and tries to crawl through it. It is too narrow and she does not fit. She bangs the wall with her hand, swears and runs to the apartment door, kicks the door several times. After the 5th kick, she stops. She hears loud steps from the stairway. She freezes, snuggles to the peephole. The lights are off in the stairway, it is dimly lit by the light across the hinterhof. She hears loud and heavy steps. Someone is coming down. She sees heavy black boots, black pants, the figure wears black. A minotaur mask sits on a person's head. The figure comes to her apartment door. She screams “Please help! I’m locked!”. She kicks the door again. She hears the knock from the other side of the door. Somebody knocked back with the foot. She stops, snuggles the window. She sees the hand moving to the door, bangs it. She screams, and runs off the door to the kitchen. She looks in the window, another figure stands there. The figure wears the same black clothes as the first one, the same minotaur head. The head looks to her window, stares with inanimate paper-mache (?) eyes. She sees her, puts hands on her eyes, opens hands again, closes the window. Semi-transparent veil reveals a silhouette with a horned head. She runs to the living room. She puts the shades on the only window, goes to the sleeping room, puts curtains down there too, comes back to the living room and sits on the couch. She looks at the ashtray full with cigarette butts. She rummages for a longer one. All are short. She finds one that still has a bit of tobacco on it. She puts on the light, puts her hands around her knees pressed to the chin, cigarette butt in her mouth. She stares at the wall, a cigarette butt in her mouth. 

She sits for some time. She fishes her pocket for a phone. She unlocks the screen and notices that the network is down. She goes to the kitchen, opens the laptop, checks it. The network is down there too. WiFi works, but no internet. No phone. She goes to the door. She bangs the door, steadily. She screams “Hello” to the door, looks into the peephole. No answer, no figures. She tries the key again, not hoping to get it open. She sits by the door, cries. She goes to sleep, exhausted, when it is almost morning, some around 5.

The next two days go by. Nothing happens. She reads Kafka and tries the same rituals: bangs the door, tries to crawl through the bathroom window. No change. She looks out the window often, and looks into the peephole. There is no one. Phone does not work. She makes teas, which she has a lot and eats pasta. She stares into the peephole most of the time. 

Evening, the second day of complete isolation, she hears noises from the street. She hears people screaming outside. She opens curtains in the living room, opens the window room. She hears better now. The noise from outside comes inside: people chanting slogans in german, organised claps, the noise of people marching. The hinterhof door opens, four people in bulls heads and black come marching towards her house. They move fast, one of the figures separates from the group, goes over the bicycle to the living room window that she is staring from. She waits and stares. The figure approaches, 3 others reach the house door, stop and stare. The first figure reaches the window, holds a black steel pole in a hand. The pole moves to the widow grill she is leaning her face to. She bounces back, shocked. The pole hits the grill 3 more times, she crawls back from the window. The other figures disappeared inside the house to the stairway. She heard the bang of the house door which she did not decry and hears now the bangs on her apartment door. She rushes to the door. The light in the peephole dances on and off. She screams, sees the door vibrating. She puts the safe lock on, brings the chair to the door, puts it to hold the door handle. She moves away from the door and sits in the hallway at the farest spot from the door. She stares at the door. Bangs stop. Her hands hold her knees, eyes peeping over the arms. She hears one short knock on the window grill. She runs to the living room. She sees 4 figures staring at her in the window. The figures stare a second, two and move inside the house. She hears an explosion somewhere far outside. She closes the window, goes over to the living room and ensures that all shades down.

The next day she wakes up late. It’s sunny. She sees the shades lit, still winterly dimly. She stays in bed and keeps shades down and lights off. When the sun goes down, she hears the long beep sound, low, but too low, like a telephone line made for whales on the other end. The sound comes from the street. The sound is not loud, after the beep the voice goes. She stands up quickly, opens curtains, the window. She sees a woman in a window opposite. She hears now more clearly. The voice iterates in german, goes for some time. She can not understand. The voice pauses and she tries to call the woman opposite. She cries “hey” the woman does not react, listening attentively to silence. The same low long beep sounds and the phrase repeats again. The woman in the window outside closes the window and puts the curtains down. She screams “heeeeeey” to the closed window. She notices now that curtains are down in all windows in the house. She goes to the bed, puts a blanket up to her eyes. She holds the blanket tightly. 




A touch woke her up the next morning. It is still dark. She says “Do you have cigarettes?” not fully awake yet. When she awakes, her head erect, still laying on the bed, she understands that someone’s in the room. She quickly moves back from the touch. The touching hand belongs to a man with a timid smile. He wears a sweater. “You wanna tea?” he smiles “I’m Mike, from work, remember me?” he smiles more. He has a timid smile. “Who are you? What are you doing here? How you get in?” she asks. He leans his hands forward in a pacifying gesture, palms up, hands outstretched. “I’m Mike, come on, Janique, we work together. I’m a manager from IT, a guy with tobacco on the party”. “I don’t remember you! It does not explain what you are doing here!” She spelt clothed. Her hands pull the blanket up to her face. She looks at him over the blanket. 
“Have some tea, please! I will explain everything in a moment. You’re here alone for a week almost. Did you eat?” he says in motherly tones. 
She relaxes a bit. “I’m eating fine. I went grocery before the thing happened.” 
“The thing?” he looks at he puzzled. “You know about the thing” he continues, capitalizing every word in “the thing”. 
“Yeah, the stupid lock, internet went down, phones went down, the locksmiths does not speak english all these things” she capitalized “thing”. 
“Oh yeah, yeah, so you know already, yeah, the thing” he says relieved. “Sorry for waking up, but the other thing is quite urgent. I will tell. Please take your time, we’re not rushing. I’ve made you some tea.” 
He moves away to the living room. The lights are on there. When he left, she reaches for the phone, checks the network. It is still down. She quickly stands up and runs to the door. 

When she passes the living room, she sees Mike sitting in a chair reading Adorno. He glances at her, when she passes him. She does not see the key in the lock. “It is still locked. I’m very sorry” says his voice. She sees the key laying on the doormat. She grabs it and tries to put it in. It does not fit. She fidgets the door-handle. Someone bangs the door from the other side. 
“Please, don’t. Let’s calm down. Have you had your tea? It’s a minty one. Very nice in the morning” His face looks disappointed. The expression that reminds her of her mother’s face. He moves into the hallway.
“What a fuck is going on?” she cries, stares over her shoulder at him. 
“...” he slowly picks his words, struggles, sighs. “Ok. Hm” he clears his throat. “You are detained by the order of the revolutionary committee of the Independent State of Neukolln.  I’m your friend, we work together. I came here to help you. Think of me as an ambassador, a negotiator. I’m here to support you”.
He looks at her waiting for her reaction. She does not say a word. She turns her head back to the door. He comes to her and puts his hand on her shoulder. 
“Get off me” she cries and pushes her hand off. 
He steps back, puts his hands in a pocket, mumbles something she does not hear. She breathes deeply. She counts up to 10 silently. 
“Who the fuck are you? Let’s start with that” she looks at him and says it slowly. “I’ve never seen you at work, “Mike”. She makes air quotes with his name. “And how did you get here?”
“I got through the door obviously! Janique, listen. My name is Mike, I worked at Amazon, you surely have seen me there! We ate lunch together, remember?” he smiles. “Let’s go sit in the living room. I’ll explain you everything and I’m sure that you will do everything right and we will remember this this as a stupid joke, a misfortune. Or better, let me say it in an Amazon way - a point of growth and development, hm? But first really, let’s go sit and relax a bit. Amazing book you have there! Adorno! I like that! Come, let’s talk!” He sounds playful. He goes to the living room. After a pause she follows him to the living room.

He sits in the easy chair by the window. He smokes a cigarette. When she enters the room, he puffs the smoke to her direction. She sits in the easy chair on the opposite side of the room. She says nothing and stares at him. He makes a couple of drags more, opens the book that sits on his lap, meets her gaze, puts his eyes back down on the book and reads:
“Wrong life cannot be lived rightly” he closes the book soundly. “That’s a very nice quote, don’t you think?” he sips the cigarette and puffs out a big white cloud.
She looks vexed at him for some time. He waits for her to say something, she waits for him.
“We don’t smoke in the house. Please stop.” she says.
“I’m so sorry! The house is full of ashtrays, I thought it’s ok, I did not want to disturb you” he says.
“I gave up!” she says through her teeth. The pause again.
“Is that a promised explanation? A lame quote?” she says after a long pause.
“Oh dear, I’m glad you’ve started this conversation! So let’s be finally clear. We all need clarity. Sooooooo” he takes the last drag and ashes the cigarette. “Janique, welcome to the new world! The world that does not forget about nature, the Earth is no longer a slave!” He says this very solemnly. “And we, as authorised envoys of the new world order, we need your help. The world needs you. The mother Earth needs you. What do you think?”
She looks perplexed at him.
“What?” she says after a pause.
“The earth is dying. We are here to stop it. We made it in Berlin. The rot was stopped. But it is just a start, our fluid force is just taking up. We need you!” he says.
“Ok. How is this related to me?” she asks.
“Oh, that’s the question that everyone was asking, right? In this old rotten world! We were all hiding plastic bags in third world countries and called this recycling. Does this sound unrelated too? We are taught that the world is somehow unrelated to us and we can buy away our private tropical happiness on the island, right?” He spits the words. “The world and you are connected now, as it always meant to. Everything is related to you, to me, to everyone. You understand?”
“Honestly, no. I’m sorry, I do not understand”.
He looks disappointed, takes a deep breath.
“Ok. Let me start over. We were working for Amazon and we are sinners. The new world demands us act accordingly now, get redemption. The door is mere a symbol of your sins. I’m here to help you and me to get our redemption. Is it clear now?” he says
“Same question: who are you? I don’t know you. I don’t need any redemption! I did nothing wrong. Ny fucking lock is broken, is it a crime?”
“Oh no no, it is not a crime. Think of the door as a mere symbol! Forget about that, it is not a problem. You should not go outside for now anyways, okay? You’re detained. I feel we’re going in circles. We know that you know where the corporate apartment is and we need to know it too.”
“What? Why?” she stares at him.
“We need to know where Amazon corporate apartment is. Say it to us.”
“Why you need to know this? Who are you?”
“We, revolutionary warriors of Independent State of Neukolln. We need leads! You know that Amazon is an enemy of the planet. You know what Bezos is here, in Berlin now. The city is locked, completely, ins and outs. We need to seize this opportunity, get Bezos.”
“And what? Do you think Bezos live in corporate apartment? Really? You are delusional.” she says
“We know that he is not there. The communication is down. We can not google his address. We need any leads. They heard you work talking, they found out you from Amazon, they need leads.”
“They? “Mike”, is your moustache fake?”
“You are funny! You are funny! Ponder about that. I have another meeting, I have to go.”. He stands up, paces to the door. She paces after him, it is too late. She sees the door closed. The paper slipped throughout the mail slit. She looks in the peephole. She sees the bull headed figure starting right at her, no sender.

She takes the paper. It looks like a form. The title says “SK”, the pencil handwriting explained as “Self-Critic”. At the bottom of the page she sees the globe and skull sign. She flips the paper over and sees a long text in german. She takes the paper to the kitchen and puts it on the table there. She sits and stares at the german instructions on the paper. She stares at the window curtain. It is a day outside. She puts the curtain up. Hinterhof is empty. 

She rummages the table in the living room and finds the pen. She goes to the kitchen, takes the paper, flips it back up and writes “Fuck you!” all over the page, flips the page back again and repeats the “fuck-you” action. She grabs the paper, tears it up in small parts, rains all parts into the ashtray and puts it on fire. She looks at the fire in the ashtray. She puts the water on and brews the noodles he left for her in the plastic pot.

She finished Kafka and started to read Adorno back again. She falls asleep in the couch with a book on her chest. 

The next day and morning are uneventful. She saw the sun rise, stay up in the sky for 2-3 hours and go down quite winterly shortly. No sounds. She kept curtains open and looked at the hinterhof in the window. When it is already dark and she is eating noodles, the door opens and Mike enters. He turns right, knowing where she is and looks at her: 
“Oh sorry! I’m late! Lots of meetings, how are you, sinner? How is your day?” he smiles stupidly.
She looks back with noodles in her mouth, slurps them in and says:
“What?” her stare supposed to burn him. 
“Are you upset? What made you feel this way?” he says in motherly tones.
“Can’t you guess?” she takes a deep breath, pauses. “I’m fine for a person who still has no idea what is going on, except for the fact that I can not leave my house. What you need from me?”
“Oh sorry once again! I just think that it’s impolite to jump to a serious topic right away! Small talk establishes natural emotional connection that is very important in our case. Right? We’re friends. I believe that anybody can be my best friend. I just do not have enough time to know a person enough. Does this make sense?” he asks and does not wait for her reply, continues. “Luckily for us, comrade (he hesitates for a second as if unsure in the treatment), we have time to know each other better. So how was your day, comrade?” he leans on the kitchen door frame.
“Fine, thanks! What do you need from me?” she says.
“We won’t come to anything good in this way, you know? Right?” he smiles fatherly (with sort of hidden contempt).
“What do you want from me?” she says through her teeth. She struggles into the chair, holds the arms.
“Oh” he sighs disappointedly. “We should first know how each other days. Why couldn’t you ask how my day? How can we establish a good trustful relationship if you don't even care how my day was? I’m sorry, I don’t feel like helping a person that does not respect me. Do you want to start over?”
Both make a pause. His chin goes down a bit in a questioning gesture, eyebrows go up, he waits for her.
“How was your day, Mike?” she says.
“Oh it was very busy actually! I’m so happy to share. Just came here from a green revolutionary meeting for non-speaking leaders. And before that I went to a museum with my wife. It was so fun! She made this funny joke. She said that “A girl has to be naked to get into the museum”. That’s smart, right? Ah?” he does not wait for an answer “And this made me think about the past, when it was true. When we were blind in making shit from shit, wearing climate blinds. Oh sorry! Jumping over! And english! Sorry! I’m brazilian, sorry. Not native language. I highly recommend visiting this museum if you have a chance.”
“Oh you are so lucky! Your wife is so smart!” she makes a fake smile. “I wish I could also go to that museum. What do you think about discussing this topic?” she says remembering corporate communication training. Now she thought that maybe she actually saw Mike there. She was not sure. “Why am I detained and what is the crime that we’re discussing?”
He takes a backpack off his back and rummages inside. He folds forth the book “How to win friends” by Carnegie.
“Here, take this, I think it’s important and will help us a lot. Please read this! I would appreciate this a lot”. He puts the book on the table near her. He sees time on his watch while leaning to put the book. 
“Oh sorry! It’s 8! Shit! I have completely forgotten! I have a meeting with supreme command representatives, need to run! I’m so sorry!” he composes himself, checks his backpack, everything. “So write the thing, right? When you are done - it’ll be good. Remember, that I’m here to support you. Ok! Bye!” he quickly ties the backpack, puts it on his back, runs away. She hears a key turn. She takes the remaining noodles to the bathroom and flushes them down the toilet. She has 2 more packs left. 

The next day. The air in the room is stuffy and she opens windows some around noon to let in the fresh air. She leans to the window grill, breathing the cold air. 
“Hallo” she hears the voice, looks at the house opposite, sees the same woman calling her. 
She sees the woman and waves her with her hand and cires “hey” in reply. The woman speaks to her in german. She looks to be in her mid 40s. She wears glasses. 
“I don’t speak german” she cries to the woman.
The woman stops, her hand waves down in a disappointed gesture and closes the window. She does the same but without a hand wave.

Later during the day she goes to the kitchen and notices a paper at the front door. She picks it up. She sees the same form as she burned in the ashtray earlier. She crumples the paper, throws it at the door and goes to the kitchen. The paper ball left laying on the floor in the hallway. 

He knocks before he enters. He never did this before. There is no pause between the knock and his face suspended in the kitchen door frame. She looks at him back, vexed and tired.
“I want a cigarette, Mike” she says to him as if she knew him.
He does not smile. His eyes can not find rest. He avoids meeting her eyes. He looks away, to the hallway, notices the crumpled paper, goes to it, picks it up, goes back in silence to the kitchen. She looks at him puzzled when he wriggles back her chair, making a way to the second chair. He sits in it, straightens the paper. His hands as if shaking. He puts his head on his hand, looks at her sternly. She sees he picks his words again. As he does this he gets angry.
“Why can’t you simply write this stupid letter and maybe will be done? A? I’ve told you everything that you need to know. But you, all of you keep betraying me. They trust me, they know that I’m not pure, but still they trust. But you! You!” he is really angry now, she moves away as he spits. She stands up and goes to the living room, closing the door after her. 
She sits in the chair, vexed, and hears a knock on the living room door. He enters the living room, sits on the couch, and looks at her sideways. 
“Look, I’m sorry for being so emotional. It was a hard day for me. Let’s start this other. Ok?” He says, his voice has apologetic notes, leaning on the couch arm.
“Get away from me, please” she says, tired of everything and him. When she says that, he moves back on the couch. He does not lean anymore, his hands clasped and in front of him. He listens to what she says.
“That’s not an option now, I’m sorry. I really need your cooperation. Please” he says.
“Cooperation on what?” she whets. “I know fucking nothing, I have no internet, I can’t go anywhere! Why? Who the fuck are you to make me do so? Just fucking let me go.” 
She stands up. He stands up almost at the same instant and puts his hand on her shoulder, when she’s standing up, pushing her back on the chair. She pushes his hand off.
“Get the fucking AWAY” she runs to the door. She tries to open it. It is locked still. She cries and sits by the door. He comes after her, squats near her.
“Hey, it is hard, I know, I’ve been through this myself, I know, I know. But you need to be strong. Nothing is yet decided. We can make this work, ok?”
“You need to answer me. I’m here to help and to support! Don’t you understand?” He tries to reason with her. She blankly stares at him and does not say a word. He tries to touch her, she pushes his hand back, but does not move.
“Are you gonna talk to me or now?” he says after a long pause and a deep breath.
She is silent.
“Ok. Ok. Fuck this shit. I’m honestly trying to help you get out of this shit you’re in. And I don’t see any appretitation for this!” he says and goes to the kitchen. He makes himself tea. When he starts to sip his tea, she stands up and goes to her bedroom and lays in the bed, pulling a blanket over her head. When sipping stops he comes to the bedroom, sees her under the blanket.
“Are ok now? Ready to talk?” he says to the blanket. She does not reply.
He sucks air in his lungs, lets it out. It takes some time. He speaks:
“So let me make this clear. You’re under arrest by the warrant of MEAT. You are under the investigation. You’ve sinned - you’ve trashed around, you’ve worked for Amazon. You did nothing good. You basically ate and shite and that was all. Mother Earth hates you, you did her harm. But I believe that you're a good person, who is just lost. And you’re rejecting my helping hand! Do you understand that? Please take it! Take it! And please write! I’ve asked you to fill the self-critic form. Without repentance it could be no redemption, I hope you understand. Do write it!”
