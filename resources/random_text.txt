Title: [Title of Your Play] 

Introduction: 

In a world increasingly dominated by consumer culture and technology, [Title of Your Play] presents a surreal, thought-provoking journey into the life of an individual overwhelmed by the pervasive influence of advertising. This play blends elements of dark humor and stark realism to explore themes of identity, consumerism, and the blurring lines between reality and the commercial world. 

Plot Overview:+ 

The narrative unfolds in a modest apartment, the home of our main character, who has recently started a new job as an 'ads watcher.' Tasked with experiencing and evaluating advertisements that appear in dreams, the character initially finds the job intriguing and lucrative. However, the play quickly descends into a surreal exploration of the impact of these ads on the character's perception of reality. 

A unique feature of this play is the physical embodiment of the ads by a group of actors. These actors invade the main character's apartment, enacting various commercial scenes with an unsettling mix of cheerfulness and underlying darkness. Initially, the main character is a passive observer of these bizarre and intrusive ad enactments. As the story progresses, the lines between observer and participant blur, with the main character increasingly assimilating into the world of the ads. 

This integration is marked by the character's gradual loss of individual identity and the increasing difficulty in distinguishing between their own thoughts and the invasive ad slogans. The dialogue and interactions become progressively cryptic and entwined, reflecting the deepening confusion and loss of self. The play culminates in an ambiguous climax, leaving the audience to ponder the profound effects of consumerism and technology on personal identity and reality. 

Key Features: 

Realistic Setting: A simple apartment that becomes the stage for the surreal interplay between reality and advertising. 

Dark Humor: Witty, satirical dialogue that underscores the play’s critical view of consumer culture. 

Surreal Elements: The blurring of reality with the intrusive and stylized world of advertisements. 

Minimalist Approach: A focus on dialogue and character interaction, avoiding traditional theatrical devices. 

[Title of Your Play] is a contemporary piece that resonates with the modern audience's experiences with the overwhelming presence of advertising in daily life. It invites viewers to reflect on the subtle ways consumer culture shapes our thoughts, behaviors, and identities. 

Overall Story Arc: Role Inversion and Entropic Dialogue 

Final Repetition of the First Scene with Alterations 

Scene Setup: The play concludes with a repetition of the first kitchen ad scene. However, now the roles are reversed — the main character and the supervisor are part of the ad, while the ad actors observe or enact different roles. 

Dialogue Changes: The same words are spoken, but they are slightly altered or "encrypted," reflecting the influence of the story's progression. This alteration signifies how the characters have changed and how their perceptions have been altered. 

Scenes Showcasing Role Reversals and Entropy 

Scene with the Main Character Enacting the Ad Alone: At some point, the familiar jingle plays, but instead of the ad actors entering, the main character alone starts performing the ad. This scene highlights the complete assimilation of the main character into the advertising world. 

Scene with the Ad Actors Occupying the Apartment: A scene where the ad actors are in the apartment, carrying out everyday activities. When the jingle plays, the main character enters and performs the ad actions, showing a total role reversal. 

Progressive Dialogue Distortion 

Incremental Changes: Throughout the play, the dialogue becomes increasingly distorted, reflecting the growing entropy in the characters' minds and their reality. 

Entropy as a Theme: This distortion mirrors the concept of entropy in both thermodynamics and information theory, symbolizing the descent into disorder and the complexity of understanding one's identity in a consumerist society. 

Final Scene: Reflection of the Journey 

Symbolic Conclusion: The play ends with a scene that mirrors the beginning, but now roles are reversed, and the dialogue is altered. This reflects the journey the characters (and the audience) have been on, questioning the nature of reality, identity, and the influence of external forces. 

Audience Interpretation: This ending invites the audience to reflect on the play's themes and their own experiences with advertising and identity. 

Implementation Considerations 

Consistent Triggers: Maintain consistent use of triggers like the jingle throughout the play to symbolize the conditioning and manipulation. 

Nuanced Performances: Require versatile and nuanced performances from the actors to effectively convey the role reversals and the subtle changes in dialogue. 

Visual and Auditory Cues: Utilize lighting, sound, and stage design to support the narrative, especially in scenes with role reversals and dialogue distortions.

They start performing a commercial, which could be for a common household product like a cleaning solution or kitchen gadget. 

The ad is over-the-top and exaggerated, with the actors demonstrating the product with almost comical enthusiasm.

Midway through their activity, the jingle plays softly in the background, but no ad actors appear. The main character, triggered by the jingle, starts mimicking actions or phrases from the previous ads, perhaps without realizing it. 

The main character pauses, looking confused or concerned, then tries to shake off the influence and resume their activity. 

The jingle plays again, this time a bit louder. The main character's behavior becomes more ad-like, reciting lines from the ads or performing exaggerated actions associated with the products. 

The scene ends with the main character fully immersed in an ad-like monologue or action sequence, showing a significant blurring of their reality with the ad world. 

Dialogue 

Main Character (Initially, to themselves): "Another day, just need to finish this chapter/work..." 

Main Character (After the first jingle, muttering an ad line): "With SuperBlend 3000, life's just a breeze..." 

Main Character (Confused, to themselves): "Why did I say that? Need to focus..." 

Main Character (More ad-like, after the second jingle): "Why settle for less when you can have the best? Try SuperBlend 3000!" 

Main Character (Fully in ad mode, enthusiastically): "Don't wait for change, make the change! SuperBlend 3000 – your gateway to a new life!"

Main Character (picking up a product, voice tinged with frustration): “I used to have choices, didn't I? Now it's like I'm just following a script. Their script.” 

The jingle plays faintly in the background, but no ad actors appear. The main character reacts to the jingle with a conditioned response, then catches themselves. 

Main Character (realizing, speaks to themselves): “It's happening again. I hear that sound and just... start playing my part. But who's directing this? Who's directing me?” 

The character has a moment of introspection, reflecting on the loss of their autonomy. 

Main Character (more to themselves than the audience): “Am I just a collection of their jingles and slogans now? Where did I go?”

“Is this it? My life, just a series of ads, one after the other?” 

“I used to know who I was, what I wanted... Now, I can't tell if it's me talking or just another tagline from an ad.” 

(If choosing a moment of clarity) “No, this isn't me. These ads, they're just noise, not my reality!” 

(If choosing a moment of confusion) “I don't know where I end and where they begin anymore. Am I just a product of what I've been sold?”

Action

The ad actors, if present, are in the role of observers or are absent, emphasizing the transformation of the main character. 

The jingle plays, but its role is different now — it no longer signals the start of an ad, but rather underscores the main character's complete assimilation into the ad world. 

Dialogue 

Main Character (in the role of an ad actor): Repeats lines from the first ad scene, but their delivery is altered — either more mechanical, indicating a loss of genuine emotion, or with a sense of realization or irony. 

Main Character (reflective, speaking to themselves or the audience): "Is this what I've become? Just another part of the script?" 

Optional lines from the ad actors or a narrator can add depth, offering commentary or posing questions to the audience about the nature of identity and consumerism. 

Conclusion of the Scene 

The scene ends with the main character either continuing their ad performance, showing complete immersion in this new reality, or pausing in a moment of self-awareness, questioning their identity. 

The lighting and sound design can reflect the mood of the conclusion — either aligning with the artificiality of the ads or contrasting it with a more somber, introspective tone. 

The final moments can be left open-ended, allowing the audience to interpret the outcome. Does the main character recognize their loss of identity, or do they remain lost in the world of ads? 

 
Scene: The First Kitchen Ad 

Setting 

Location: The main character's apartment, specifically the kitchen area.

Action 

Beginning (Reality): The main character is in the kitchen, possibly making coffee or breakfast, portraying a typical morning routine. 

Transition to Ad (Surreal): The ad actors enter the stage seamlessly, as if they belong there. They bring in props that are more vibrant and start performing an overly enthusiastic demonstration of kitchenware (like a new blender or non-stick pan). 

Ad Performance: The ad actors perform with exaggerated smiles and enthusiasm, showcasing the kitchenware with lines like, “Isn’t this the easiest way to blend your smoothies?” or “Look at how these eggs just slide off the pan!” 

Main Character's Reaction (Confusion and Curiosity): Initially, the main character is taken aback, watching in confusion. Slowly, their expressions change to curiosity as they observe the ad play out in their kitchen. 

Dialogue 

Ad Actor 1 (Enthusiastically): “Welcome to the future of cooking! With our new SuperBlend 3000, you’ll never waste a minute on those pesky, time-consuming food prep tasks again!” 

Ad Actor 2 (With an exaggerated smile): “And with its AI technology, it knows what you want before you do! Goodbye, free will in the kitchen!” 

Main Character (Confused, then sarcastically): “Great, because making choices was such a burden…” 

Ad Actor 3 (Holding up a non-stick pan): “And with this pan, not even the stickiest of problems will remain. It’s like all your troubles just slide away – too bad it only works on food, right?” 

Main Character (Dryly, as if talking to themselves): “If only it could make my existential dread non-stick too…” 

Ad Actor 1 (Ignoring the main character’s remark): “It’s not just cookware; it’s a lifestyle! Transform your mundane existence with a single swipe of your credit card!” 

Main Character (Muttering): “Because that’s what’s been missing from my life, a high-tech blender and existential debt.” 

Conclusion of the Scene 

Ad Actors Exit (Cheerfully): “Remember, happiness is just a purchase away! See you at your next dilemma!” 

Main Character’s Reflection (Looking at the props, bemused): “Right, because buying stuff always fills the void. Who needs therapy when you have a SuperBlend 3000?” 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Some side notes. Just thread the. The, the. The. About the camera and how camera affects the space. And. So I'm I'll, I'll, I'll just gonna read it from the book. And next I say how I want to. Use it. Uh-huh. So like first thing like a woman all context. A girl is all concept. And this book is about image, so I think it's very important. For the play. So I guess the main character is the girl. So like another important thing is like repeated actions, self becomes demonstration. And uh, the word demonstration is linked to the word monster. And the. The most important thing that I wanted to mention is about the camera work and how it. Uh, should go so like the fixed camera keeps its distance across duman's kitchen counter so her private household activities look just like an on screen cookery demonstration with no immediate. Oceans, but the camera. And next screens became smaller. We crossed into private space. Still Invision, laptops. Phones. So the idea here. Is maybe this can be played on in a sense that the first it can start? With the. Screen just full screen and camera which is not moving. And next. As the play goes, as entropy increases, as the confusion increases, as everything becomes more and more chaotic. Like at some points like we can use. The different UH mobile phone camera which is like vertical. It can symbolize intrusion. Into uh. Space. And like. The. Here comes the idea of the. Like the offer is dead right and. That is given. But let's kill the one who observes. So like the fact that it all starts with one moving camera. Is actually a means. That there is no observer there. Whereas only actor and the camera which does not move or react, so it does not resemble anything. Human like or animate? Uh. Yeah, so. And the specter and the observer. Will appear. Out of nowhere, out of out of this. Growing entropy and the growing intrusion into private space of the main character. The because when when when the screen gets smaller and the private space gets invaded. Private space gets invaded by the camera, and the camera is now not static. It now resembles the moving object. Which essentially means which. But it can. It can. Uh be. Mistaken. For a living being. For something to intrude into your personal space. Something must exist. And this something in this case is a camera. Which is? Uh, the the person who's watching. The the, the, the, the, the play. So I think I will reiterate. Uh. The, the, the, the, the the whole idea, the whole concept simply. And like as far as I remember. So that tomorrow I'll be able to sit down and edit it so. 
 
 
 
 The core idea. The core ideas are. The. Uh. Screens. Odds. Identity. Entropy. And that is all. 
 The plot goes. Through the repetition of the same thing. Essentially the the same thing that keeps repeating itself. Is the art intrusions? So the. The The whole play takes place. In only one place. It is an apartment. There is nothing special about it. A girl. Lives in this apartment. It all starts. With her living her life. Doing some kitchen stuff and I'm not trying to be sexist here. Intent. Initially the main character was male. Um. When she does that, she hears the Jingle. And when the Jingle plays. Uh. Nonchalant. Combs, the troop of actors. It's 3 actors. They all represent the ad. Are they? Lock some. Human qualities. They are too polished. For to to to be distinguished as a human, there definitely are actors from the odds. They entered the apartment, not giving any attention to the group. And do over other things. Uh, the other things are listed above. Uh. And maybe they need to be extended. So. At first. Girl. Reacts confused. And just. She's just human yet. But as the story progresses. The roles start to. Change. Not only Rose, everything starts to change. Intrepid Entropy kicks in. And entropy kicks in, in the sense that. Increasingly confusing and chaotic reality. Is being tried to be explained and reasoned by increasingly confused and chaotic characters. Uh and where confusion is coming from? Not themselves, even because they start she. She's the only character of the. Play. She starts to lose herself. This lost. Is represented. As she. First, occasionally and seemingly unexpectedly starts to take part. And in the ads and stops being herself. Uh, the the the catch phrases from the add sleep into her language. 1st next she. Acts as if she's part of a troop. And no one from the troop he is taking this in any consideration. I think that the climax of that should be the complete reversal when the add troop. Are doing the the same exact stuff that she was doing. At the beginning. And the Jingle plays. Uh, and she does the routines that they were doing. And so that's that's basically the whole plot. And. Some important side notes. So like the repetition is not always exact. Repetition is the way to show how entropy works. So everything ripped itself. But uh, at the same time, it always changes a tiny bit. What I mean by that for example. The odds are mostly about kitchenware, so the add troop always leaves. Parts of the things that they advertise in the kitchen. And uh. It should be obvious and it should be uh. Uh. Love put into accent where the things stand and at first only only this add, things start to change their places. But over time. The the the chaos increases and that's that's the question. Maybe the whole whole stage becomes empty and filled with the add stuff. And the whole stage becomes the add stage. The whole stage becomes a stage. Um. Another important thing, which is like the baby that I don't wanna kill is but cheers. Needs. To be. Missing over the course today. So first we start with four chairs in the kitchen. So that's enough for everybody to sit. And over the course of the play. Cheers. Are started starting to get missed. And it creates some comedic, even slapstick and distasteful. Type of humor situations for the actors. Each of them. And why chairs? Because it's transference to both wire album and the the English proverb that he has some chairs missing in his house. I think it sounds like that, which means that the person is going. Mad. Um. Do. Yes, and be very careful with language as the as as the place, so minimalistic and lacking any substance or tricks in its plot and idea. So everything should be very carefully considered, especially the language that the actors use, the, the. And the most important part? To incorporate both the the the the the the the the fact that identity change. Comes through the language. The first signs of the vigil being. Affected by The odds is that she starts to use words from these ads. So the language plays a role of the mediator as sort of like the the virus which. Which affects both sides, ironically. As, as, as add through actors, some of them start to act like the girl. Instead of her. Um. And at the same time, it's important to. Maybe read more Finnigan's wake or. Just try do do some research. Because ideally by the end like the first of all the the the product names are keep changing. First slightly when just turning into something. The British. Um, gibberish. Um. But at the same time this everything should be gibberish but understandable gibberish. And this of this is an obvious contradiction which? Needs to be. Foot doubt carefully. And I guess I should just. Sleep over it. But umm, yeah, I think that Finnigan's wake can be a good. Good starting point for gibberish which is not gibberish. Ohh. Yeah, I have some 70 pages read and. Some quotes from there. Like and do not forget to use the the phrase gay labouring youth. And because it's the the the from Finnigan's wake and I love it. Hmm. So yeah, please try to. Finish the complete draft. By the by this weekend. Next you put it. In a table for two or three weeks. And you don't think about it. When you come back to it. Read it once again, you as you, as if you see it first time and it is not written by you. And give your honest opinion and let's see where we're gonna go from there.
