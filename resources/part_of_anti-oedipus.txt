exchanges, as Levi-Strauss would have it, than one of establishing a 
physical system that will express itself naturally in terms of debts. It 
seems to us very significant that Levi-Strauss himself invokes the 
co-ordinates of a physical system, although he sees this as nothing more 
than a metaphor. In the physical system in extension, something passes 
through that is of the nature of an energy flow (+- or -+), something 
does not pass or remains blocked (+ + or —), and something blocks, or 
on the contrary causes, passage. Something or someone. In this system 
in extension there is no primary filiation, nor is there a first generation or 
an initial exchange, but there are always and already alliances, at the 
same time as the filiations are extended, expressing both what must 
remain blocked in the filiation and what must pass through in the 
alliance. 

The essential is not that the signs change according to the sexes and 
the generations, but that one passes from the intensive to the extensive, 
that is to say, from an order of ambiguous signs to an order of signs that 
are changing but determined. It is here that resorting to myth is 
indispensable, not because the myth would be a transposed or even an 
inverse representation of real relations in extension, but because only 
the myth can determine the intensive conditions of the system (the 
system of production included) in conformity with indigenous thought 
and practice. That is why a text of Marcel Griaule's, which looks to myth 
for a principle that would explain the avunculate, seems decisive to us, 
and seems to avoid the reproach of idealism that usually greets this kind 
of attempt. We have a similar view of the recent article in which Adler 
and Cartry retum to the question.'* These authors are right in remarking 
that Levi-Strauss's kinship atom—with its four relationships: 
brother-sister, husband-wife, father-son, maternal uncle-sister's 
son—presents itself as a ready-made whole from which the mother as 
such is strangely excluded, although, depending on the circumstances, 
she can be more or less a "kinswoman" or more or less an "affine" in 
relation to her children. Now this is indeed where the myth takes root, 
the myth that does not express but conditions. As Griaule relates it, the 
Yourougou, breaking into the piece of placenta he has stolen, is like the 
brother of his mother, with whom he is united by that fact: "This 
individual went away into the distance carrying with him a part of the 
nourishing placenta, which is to say a part of his own mother. He saw 
this organ as his own and as forming a part of his own person, in such a 
way that he identified himself with the one who gave birth to him. She 
was the matrix of the world, and he considered himself to be placed on 
the same plane as she from the viewpoint of th e generations.. .. He 
senses unconsciously his symbolic membership in his mother's 
generation and his detachment 
from the real generation of which he is a member. . . . Being, according 
to him, of the same sub stance and generation a s his mother, he likens 
himself to a male twin of his genetrix, and the mythical rule of the union 
of two paired members proposes him as the ideal husband. Hence, in his 
capacity as pseudo brother to his genetrix, he should be in the position 
of his maternal uncle, the designated husband of this woman."4 

Doubtless all the dramatis personae will be found to come into play 
from this point on: mother, father, son, mother's brother, son's sister. 
But it is evident and striking that these are not persons. Their names do 
not designate persons, but rather the intensive variations of a "vibratory 
spiraling movement," inclusive disjunctions, necessarily twin states 
through which a subject passes on the cosmic egg. Everything must be 
interpreted in intensity. The egg and the placenta itself, swept by an 
unconscious life energy "susceptible to augmentation and diminution." 
The father is in no way absent. But Amma, the father and genitor, is 
himself a high intensive part, immanent to the placenta, inseparable 
from the twinness, which relates him to his feminine part. And if the 
Yourougou son carries away a part of the placenta in his turn, it is in an 
intensive relationship with another part that contains his own sister or 
twin sister. But, aiming too high, the part he carries away makes him the 
sister of his mother, who eminently replaces the sister, and to whom he 
becomes united by replacing Amma. In short, a whole world of 
ambiguous signs, included divisions and bisexual states. I am the son, 
and also my mother's brother and my sister's husband and my own 
father. Everything rests on the placenta, which has become the earth, 
the unengendered, the full body of antiproduction where the 
organs-partial objects of a sacrificed Nommo are attached. It is because 
the placenta, as a substance common to the mother and the child, a 
common part of their bodies, makes it such that these bodies are not like 
cause and effect, but are both products derived from this same 
substance, in relation to which the son is his mother's twin: such is 
indeed the axis of the Dogon myth related by Griaule. Yes, I have been 
my mother and I have been my son. It is rare that one sees myth and 
science saying the same thing from such a great distance: the Dogon 
narrative develops a mythical Weismannism, where the germinative 
plasma forms an immortal and continuous lineage that does not depend 
on bodies; on the contrary, the bodies of the parents as well as the 
children depend on it. Whence the distinction between two lines, the 
one continuous and germinal, but the other discontinuous and somatic, 
it alone being subjected to a succession of generations. (T. D. Lysenko 
employed a naturally Dogon tone, turning it back against Weismann, to 
reproach him for making the son the genetic or germinal brother of the 
mother: "The 
Morganists-Mendelians, following Weismann, start from the idea that the parents 
are not genetically the parents of their children; if we are to believe their doctrine, 
parents and children are brothers and sisters."'*) But the son is not somatically his 
mother's brother and twin. That is why he cannot marry her (bearing in mind what 
we said earlier to be the meaning of "that is why"). The one who should have 
married the mother was therefore the maternal uncle. The first consequence of 
this is that incest with the sister is not a substitute for incest with the mother, but 
on the contrary the intensive model of incest as a manifestation of the germinal 
lineage. Then again, Hamlet is not an extension of Oedipus, an Oedipus to the 
second degree; on the contrary, a negative or inverse Hamlet is primary in 
relation to Oedipus. The subject does not reproach the uncle for having done what 
he himself wanted to do; he reproaches him for not having done what he the son 
could not do. And why didn't the uncle marry the mother, his somatic sister? 
Because he must not, except in the name of this germinal filiation, marked by 
ambiguous signs of twinness and bisexuality, according to which the son could 
have done it as well, and could have been himself this uncle in an intense 
relationship with the mother-twin. The vicious circle of the germinal lineage 
closes (the primitive double bind): neither can the uncle marry his sister, the 
mother, nor from that moment can the son marry his own sister—the Yourougou 
female twin will be delivered over to the Nommos as a potential affine. The 
somatic order causes the whole intensive scale to collapse again. Actually, if the 
son cannot marry his mother, it is not because he is somatically from a different 
generation. Arguing against Malinowski, Levi-Strauss has demonstrated convinc- 
ingly that the mixing of generations was not in the least feared as such, and that 
the incest prohibition could not be explained in this manner.'° This is because the 
mixing of the generations in the son-mother case has the same effect as their 
correspondence in the case of the uncle-sister, that is, it testifies to one and the 
same intensive germinal filiation that must be repressed in both cases. In short, a 
somatic system in extension can constitute itself only insofar as the filiations 
become extended, correlatively to lateral alliances that become established. It is 
through the prohibition of incest with the sister that the lateral alliance is sealed; it 
is through the prohibition of incest with the mother that the filiation becomes 
extended. There we find no repression of the father, no foreclosure of the name of 
the father. The respective position of the mother or father as kin or affine, the 
patrilineal or matrilineal character of the filiation, and the patrilateral or 
matrilateral character of the marriage, are active elements of the repression, and 
not objects at which the repression is directed. It is not even the memory of 
filiation in 
general that is repressed by a memory of alliance. It is the great nocturnal 
memory of the intensive germinal filiation that is repressed for the sake of an 
extensive somatic memory, created from filiations that have become extended 
(patrilineal or rnatrilineal) and from the alliances that they imply. The entire 
Dogon mythology is a patrilineal version of the opposition between the two 
genealogies and the two filiations: in intensity and in extension, the intense 
germinal order and the extensive regime of the somatic generations. 

The system in extension is born of the intensive conditions that make it 
possible, but it reacts on them, cancels them, represses them, and allows them no 
more than a mythical expression. The signs cease to be ambiguous at the same 
time as they are determined in relation to the extended filiations and the lateral 
alliances: the disjunctions become exclusive, restrictive (the "either/or else" 
replaces the intense "either ... or ... or . . ."); the names, the appellations no 
longer designate intensive states, but discernible persons. Discernibility settles 
on the sister and the mother as prohibited spouses. The reason is that persons, 
with the names that now designate them, do not exist prior to the prohibitions 
that constitute them as such. Mother and sister do not exist prior to their 
prohibition as spouses. Robert Jaulin says it well: "The mythical discourse has as 
its theme the passage from indifference to incest to its prohibition. Implicit or 
explicit, this theme underlies all the myths; it is therefore a formal property of 
this language."'’ We must conclude that, strictly speaking, incest does not and 
cannot exist. We are always on this side of incest, in a series of intensities that is 
ignorant of discernible persons; or else beyond incest, in an extension that 
recognizes them, that constitutes them, but that does not constitute them without 
rendering them impossible as sexual partners. One can commit incest only after a 
series of substitutions that always moves us away from it, that is to say, with a 
person who is equivalent to the mother or the sister only by virtue of not being 
either: she who is discernible as a possible spouse. Such is the meaning of 
preferential marriage: the first incest that is permitted. But it is not by chance that 
this kind of marriage rarely occurs, as though it were still too close to the 
nonexistent impossible (for example, the preferential Dogon marriage with the 
uncle's daughter, she being equivalent to the aunt, who is herself equivalent to 
the mother). 

Griaule's article is without doubt the text most profoundly inspired by 
psychoanalysis in the whole of anthropology. Yet it leads to conclusions that 
cause the whole of Oedipus to shatter, because it is not content to pose the 
problem in extension, thereby assuming its solution. These are the conclusions 
drawn by Adler and Cartry: "It is customary 
to consider incestuous relations in myth either as the expression of the desire or 
the nostalgia for a world where such relations wouid be possible or would meet 
with indifference, or as the expression of a structural function of the inversion of 
the social rule, a function destined to found the prohibition and its transgression. 
... In both instances, one takes as something already constituted what is in fact 
the emergence of an order that the myth narrates and explains. In other 
words,one reasons as if the myth placed on the stage persons defined as father, 
mother, brother, and sister, whereas these roles belong to the order constituted by 
the prohibition . . . : incest does not exist."* Incest is a pure limit. Provided that 
two false beliefs concerning the limit are avoided: one that makes the limit a 
matrix or an origin, as though the prohibition proved that the thing was "first" 
desired as such; another that makes the limit a structural function, as though the 
supposedly "fundamental" relationship between desire and law were manifested 
in transgression. It is necessary to recall once more that the law proves nothing 
about an original reality of desire because it essentially disfigures the desired; 
and that the trangression proves nothing about a functional reality of the law 
because, far from being a mockery of the law, it is itself derisory in relation to 
what the law prohibits in reality (the reason why revolutions have nothing to do 
with transgressions). In short, the limit is neither a this-side-of nor a beyond: it is 
the boundary line between the two— Incest, that slandered shallow 
stream—always crossed already or not yet crossed. For incest is like this motion, 
it is impossible. And it is not impossible in the same sense that the Real would be 
impossible, but quite the contrary, in the sense that the Symbolic is. 

But what does it mean to say that incest is impossible? Isn't it possible to go 
to bed with one's sister or mother? And how do we dispense with the old 
argument: it must be possible since it is prohibited? The problem lies elsewhere. 
The possibility of incest would require both pers ons and n ames—son, sister, 
mother, brother, father. Now in the incestuous act we can have persons at our 
disposal, but they lose their names inasmuch as these names are inseparable from 
the prohibition that proscribes them as partners; or else the names subsist, and 
designate nothing more than prepersonal intensive states that could just as well 
"extend" to other persons, as when one calls his legitimate wife "mama," or one's 
sister his wife. It is in this sense that we said we are always on this side of it or 
beyond. Our mothers and our sisters melt in 


* Adler and Cartry (see reference note 13). Jacques Derrida wrote, in a commentary of Rousseau: "Before 
the feast there was no incest because there was no prohibition of incest. After the feast there is no longer 
any incest because it is prohibited. . . . The feast itself would be the incest itself if any such 
thing—itse/f/—could take place" (De la grammatologie [see reference note 53], pp. 372-77). 
our arms; their names slide on their persons like a stamp that is too wet. This is 
because one can never enjoy the person and the name at the same time—yvet this 
would be the condition for incest. Granted, incest is a lure, it is impossible. But 
the problem is only deferred. Is that not the nature of desire, that one desires the 
impossible? At least in this instance, the platitude is not even true. We are 
reminded how illegitimate it is to conclude from the prohibition anything 
regarding the nature of what is prohibited; for the prohibition proceeds by 
dishonoring the guilty, that is to say, by inducing a disfigured or displaced image 
of the thing that is really prohibited or desired. Indeed, this is how social 
repression prolongs itself by means of a psychic repression without which it 
would have no grip on desire. What is desired is the intense germinal or 
germinative flow, where one would look in vain for persons or even functions 
discernible as father, mother, son, sister, etc., since these names only designate 
intensive variations on the full body of the earth determined as the germen. It is 
always possible to use the term incest, as well as indifference to incest, for this 
regime composed of one and the same being or flow, varying in intensity 
according to inclusive disjunctions. But that is precisely the problem; one cannot 
confound incest as it would be in this intensive nonpersonal regime that would 
institute it, with incest as represented in extension in the state that prohibits it, and 
that defines it as a transgression against persons. Jung is therefore entirely correct 
in saying that the Oedipus complex signifies something altogether different from 
itself, and that in the Oedipal relation the mother is also the earth, and incest is an 
infinite renaissance. (He is wrong only in thinking that he has thus "transcended" 
sexuality.) The somatic complex refers to a germinal implex. Incest refers to a 
this-side-of that cannot be represented as such in the complex, since the complex 
is an element derived from this this-side-of. Incest as it is prohibited (the form of 
discernible persons) is employed to repress incest as it is desired (the substance of 
the intense earth). The intensive germinal flow is the representative of desire; it is 
against this flow that the repression is directed. The extensive Oedipal figure is its 
displaced represented (le represents deplace), the lure or fake image, born of 
repression, that comes to conceal desire. It matters little that this image is 
"impossible": it does its work from the moment that desire lets itself be caught as 
though by the impossible itself. You see, that is what you wanted! However it is 
this conclusion, going directly from the repression to the repressed, and from the 
prohibition to the prohibited, that already implies the whole paralogism of social 
repression. 
But why is the germinal implex or influx repressed, since it is nevertheless 

the territorial representative of desire? Because the thing it 
refers to, in its capacity as representative, is a flow that would not be codable, 
that would not let itself be coded—specifically, the terror of the primitive socius. 
No chain could be detached, nothing could be selected; nothing would pass from 
filiation to descent, but descent would be perpetually reduced to filiation in the 
act of re-engendering oneself; the signifying chain would not form any code, it 
would only emit ambiguous signs and be perpetually eroded by its own energetic 
support; what would flow on the full body of the earth would be as unfettered as 
the noncoded flows that shift and slide on the desert of a body without organs. 
For it is less a question of abundance or scarcity, of a spring or the exhaustion of 
a spring (even the drying up of a spring is a flow), than of what is codable or 
noncodable. The germinal flow is such that it amounts to the same to say that 
everything would pass or flow with it, or on the contrary, that everything would 
be blocked. For the flows to be codable, their energy must allow itself to be 
quantified and qualified; it is necessary that selections from the flows be made in 
relation to detachments from the chain: something must pass through but 
something must also be blocked, and something must block and cause to pass 
through. Now this is possible only in the system in extension that renders persons 
discernible, that makes a determinate use of signs, an exclusive use of the 
disjunctive syntheses, and a conjugal use of the connective syntheses. Such is 
indeed the meaning of the incest prohibition conceived as the establishment of a 
physical system in extension: one must look in each case for the part of the flow 
of intensity that passes through, for what does not pass, and for what causes 
passage or prevents it, according to the patrilateral or matrilateral nature of the 
marriages, according to the patrilineal or matrilineal nature of the lineages, 
according to the general regime of the extended filiations and the lateral alliances. 

Let us return to the Dogon preferential marriage as analyzed by Griaule: 
what is blocked is the relationship with the aunt as a substitute for the mother, in 
the form of a make-believe parent; what passes through is the relationship with 
the aunt's daughter as a substitute for the aunt, as the first possible or permitted 
incest; what does the blocking or causes passage is the maternal uncle. What 
passes through leads to—as compensation for what is blocked—a veritable 
surplus value of code, which falls to the uncle insofar as he causes passage, while 
he suffers a kind of "minus value" insofar as he does the blocking (thus the ritual 
thefts perpetrated by the nephews in the uncle's house, but also, as Griaule says, 
"the augmentation and fructification" of the uncle's possessions when the oldest 
of the nephews comes to live with him). The fundamental problem—who has the 
right to the matrimonial prestations in a given system?—cannot be resolved independently of the lines 
of passage and the lines of blockage, as if what was blocked or 
prohibited reappeared "in marriages in spectral form,"'* coming to 
demand its due. Loftier writes of a specific case: "Among the Mru, the 
patrilineal model predominates over the matrilineal tradition: the 
brother-sister relationship, which is transmitted from father to son and 
from mother to daughter, can be transmitted indefinitely through the 
father-son relationship, but not through the mother-daughter relation- 
ship, which terminates with the daughter's marriage. A married daughter 
transmits to her own daughter a new relationship, namely that which 
joins her to her own brother. At the same time, a daughter who marries 
becomes detached not from her brother's line, but solely from that of 
her mother's brother. The significance of the payments to the mother's 
brother upon the marriage of his niece can be understood only in the 
following way: the girl leaves the previous family group, to which her 
mother belongs. The niece becomes herself a mother and the point of 
departure for a new brother-sister relationship, on which a new alliance 
is founded."!? What is prolonged, what comes to a halt, what is 
detached, and the different relationships according to which these 
actions and passions are distributed, help us to understand the formation 
mechanism of the surplus value of code as an indispensable element of 
any coding of flows. 

We are now able to outline the various instances of territorial 
representation in the primitive socius. In the first place, the germinal 
influx of intensity conditions all representation: it is the representative of 
desire. But if it is termed representative, this is because it is equivalent 
to the noncodable, noncoded, or decoded flows. In this sense it implies, 
in its own way, the socius's limit, the limit or the negative of every 
socius; the repression of this limit is possible only to the extent that the 
representative itself undergoes a repression. This repression determines 
what part of the influx will pass through and what will not in the system 
in extension, what will remain blocked or stocked in the extended 
filiations, and on the contrary, what will move and flow following the 
relations of alliance, in such a way that the systematic coding of the 
flows will be carried out. We call this second instance—the repressing 
representation itself—alliance, since the filiations become extended only 
in terms of lateral alliances that measure their variable segments. 
Whence the importance of these "local lines" that Leach has 
identified—and which, two by two, organize the alliances and arrange 
(machine) the marriages. When we ascribed to them a perverse-normal 
activity, we meant that these local groups were the agents of repression, 
the great coders. Wherever men meet and assemble to take wives for 
themselves, to negotiate for them, to share them, etc., one recognizes 
the perverse tie of a primary homosexuality between local groups, 
between brothers-in-law, co-husbands, childhood partners. 

Underlining the universal fact that marriage is not an alliance 
between a man and a woman, but "an alliance between two families," "a 
transaction between men concerning women," Georges Devereux drew 
the correct conclusion of a basic homosexual motivation of a group 
character.”? Through women, men establish their own connections; 
through the man-woman disjunction, which is always the outcome of 
filiation, alliance places in connection men from different filiations. The 
question why a female homosexuality hasn't given rise to Amazon 
groups capable of negotiating for men perhaps finds its reply in 
women's affinity with the germinal influx, resulting in the enclosed 
position of women in the midst of extended filiations (filiation hysteria as 
opposed to alliance paranoia). Male homosexuality is therefore the 
representation of alliance that represses the ambiguous signs of intense 
bisexual filiation. However, Devereux seems to us to be wrong on two 
occasions. First, when he admits having recoiled too long before 
this—so serious (he says)—discovery of a homosexual representation 
(there we merely see a primitive version of the formula "All men are 
homosexuals," and to be sure, they are never more so than when they 
arrange marriages). Then again—and this is his most serious error— 
when he wants to make of this homosexuality of alliance a product of 
the Oedipus complex as something repressed. Alliance can never be 
deduced from the lines of filiation through the intermediary of Oedipus; 
on the contrary, alliance articulates them, impelled by the action of the 
local lines and their non-oedipal primary homosexuality. And if it is true 
that there exists an Oedipal or filiative homosexuality, this should be 
understood merely as a secondary reaction to this group homosexuality, 
non-oedipal at first. 

As for Oedipus in general, it is not the repressed—that is, the 
representative of desire, which is on this side of and completely ignorant 
of daddy-mommy. Nor is it the repressing representation, which is 
beyond, and which renders the persons discernible only by subjecting 
them to the homosexual rules of alliance. Incest is only the retroactive 
effect of the repressing representation on the repressed representative: 
the representation disfigures or displaces this representative against 
which it is directed; it projects onto the representative, categories, 
rendered discernible, that it has itself established; it applies to the 
representative terms that did not exist before the alliance organized the 
positive and the negative into a system in extension—the representation 
reduces the representative to what is blocked in this system. Hence 
Oedipus is indeed the limit, but the displaced limit that now passes into 
the interior of the socius. Oedipus is the baited image with which desire 
allows itself to be caught (That's what you wanted! The decoded flows 
were incest!). Then a long story begins, the story of oedipalization. But 
to be exact, everything begins in the mind of Laius, the old group 
homosexual, the pervert, who sets a trap for desire. For desire is that, 
too: a trap. Territorial representation comprises these three instances: 
the repressed repr esentative, the repressing representation, and the 
displaced represented. 
We are moving too fast, acting as if Oedipus were already 
installed within the savage territorial machine. However, as Nietzsche 
says with regard to bad conscience, such a plant does not grow on that 
kind of terrain. This is explained by the fact that the necessary 
conditions for Oedipus as a "familial complex," existing in the frame- 
work of the familialism suited to psychiatry and psychoanalysis, are 
obviously not present. Primitive families constitute a praxis, a politics, a 
strategy of alliances and filiations; formally, they are the driving 
elements of social reproduction; they have nothing to do with an 
expressive microcosm; in these families the father, the mother, and the 
sister always also function as something other than father, mother, or 
sister. And in addition to the father, the mother, etc., there is the affine, 
who constitutes the active, concrete reality and makes the relations 
between families coextensive with the social field. It would not even be 
exact to say that the family determinations burst apart at every corner of 
this field and remain attached to strictly social determinations, since 
both kinds of determinations form one and the same component in the 
territorial machine. Since familial reproduction is not yet a simple 
means, or a material at the service of a social reproduction of another 
nature, there is no possibility of reducing (rabattre sur) social reproduc- 
tion to familial reproduction, nor is it possible to establish one-to-one 
relations between the two that would confer on any familial complex 
whatever an expressive value and an apparent autonomous form. On the 
contrary, it is evident that the individual in the family, however young, 
directly invests a social, historical, economic, and political field that is 
not reducible to any mental structure or affective constellation. That is 
why, when one considers pathological cases and processes of cure in 
primitive societies, it seems to us entirely insufficient to compare them 
with psychoanalytic procedure by relating them to criteria borrowed 
from the latter: for example, a familial complex, even if it differs from 
our own, or cultural material (des con tenus c ulturels), even if it is 
brought into relation with an ethnic unconscious—as seen in attempted 
parallelisms between the psychoanalytic cure and the shamanistic cure 
(Devereux, Levi-Strauss). Our definition of schizoanalysis focused on 
two aspects: the destruction of the expressive pseudo forms of the 
unconscious, and the discovery of desire's unconscious investments of 
the social field. It is from this point of view that we must consider many 
primitive cures; they are schizoanalysis in action.
