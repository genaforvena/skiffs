Samuel Beckett wakes in a distant night, craving the company of someone who knows how to summon rags to cover his shame, and finds his bicycle, MOLLO Y 17. Despite his disability, he rides it using crutches. Arrested that afternoon, he is advised by a sergeant to behave and given sustenance by a social worker.

Samuel's nights are moonless and the moon foreign, so he has never seen the MOLLOY. A character, MOLLOY 33, is accused of murder. 'A bloodthirsty mob accuses MOLLOY 33 of killing a man named Teddy.' MollY 49, perfuming linens with lavender, possesses the ability to levitate and collapse like a puppet when dropped. MoLLY 133 performs tedious duties, following the voice that MoLLY is ambiguous and not always easy to understand. Samuel, ill, withdraws more money than expected. The dim man is described as MOLLOY 151, a small, thick-set man who wears a navy-blue suit approaches him. MOLLOY 151 owns a plot, making a bee-line to a woman but finding obstacles. ' Worm, watched by Samuel, is bored and terrified by people. Worm is an impotent crystalline who hopes for things to continue as they are. An octogenarian character lives in a room with two pots and a bed. MOLLOY 182, the last of the characters, observes a bird. He gropes through life, deceived about the nature of her tribulations. MALONE DIES 225 believes that she has grasped the true nature of her absurd tribulations, but she was deceived into thinking she had grasped it. The light source from the outer world comes from the moon. Samuel plans to end various lives. The setting is a dirty white and vaulted den with dirty white walls and a vaulted ceiling.

Samuel Beckett has a habit of disposing things he loves due to new loves. Samuel's understanding of men comes from Mahood, an angel, who believes in a certain truth. Both Worm and Samuel believe that. Mahood is upset at having been expelled from the world of the Bargain by a pack of blood relations and two cunts. Mahood's story involves two separate events, one of which ejected him into the infundibuliform world and the other in which he tried to take revenge. The actions of Samuel Becket caused a physiological reaction that led to a desire to vomit. It has been a long time since Mahood last knew what he was talking about and his thoughts have been elsewhere, which is why he forgives Mahood for his actions. Worm and Mahood feel justified in their silence about the issue because it would have been impossible to discuss the issue if they were both silent. Organs, hair, eyes, and ears have fallen and are still falling, leaving no trace.'Mahood tells stories that are part of a tradition handed down from generation to generation according to their generations tradition. Samuel is published by Simon Cowell at the end of this week at the bottom of a ditch. "I wish I smelt like a sheep, or a buck-goat," writes the author.

Worm, a solitary creature, communicates only through murmurs, hopes to tire others of talking. espite not being able to speak, Worm has survived others like Mahood and considers the issue of liberty a consideration for later. Despite his lack of ears, head, memories, and memory, Worm has an ego and believes he has the ability to speak of it. Samuel perceives himself as distinct, the only one of his kind, capable of creating fairy tales for post-lunatics, blaming bacillus botulinus for his demise. Despite his silence, Mahood and Worm find themselves unable to free Samuel from his situation. It's too late to return.
