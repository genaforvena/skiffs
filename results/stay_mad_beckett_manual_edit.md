I'm all these flakes, meeting, mingling, falling asunder, dispersing, and dispersing like a particle of me, with no ground for their dispersing and no sky for them to settle."
"I am a wordless thing in an empty place, a hard shut dry cold, black place where nothing stirs, nothing speaks and I listen.
I seek like a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of me, a particle of you.
Oh, you see, you can see it here.
Yeah, that’s what I think.
Well, are you a person?
I think I am a person.
Well, that's how things look like people. The

There is I and there is a noise.
There was never doubt about the existence of I and the noise, there was never any doubt about that.
The topic of the noise will be the focus of the next deliberation.
In the conversation, I have only begun to express my feelings about I and this noise, and I see nothing else for the moment.
It is impossible to speak without sounding stupid and so I will continue without speaking as long as all that is needed is to do one thing. This action will be in order to not speak any more. This action is something I should have done before the moment of speaking took place, in order to prevent me from making the same mistake that has been made. I think that this is a very wise move from the wise to the foolish. We should not talk like this when we aren’t sure whether they are good or not.
But those friends always say that the only way to save your life is to keep quiet and

The speaker has the ability to speak without ceasing and has the capacity to find, find, lose, find again, throw away, seek again, and never throw anything away.
Despite not throwing anything away, the speaker has never found anything that she didn't already have and has never lost anything.
The speaker questions the nature of time, questioning why it doesn't pass and why it piles up in different directions, asking why the sun never truly sets, and why the universe doesn't ever end and never return to the beginning at all. Her logic is to make it as short as possible. While the speaker does not have a great deal of understanding or imagination, she is able to find a logical explanation of anything, usually the most logical being that of a worm swallowing another one. She is also great at the mental image, however, she is also able to find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way to find a way to

Mahood has a kindling fire, a dying fire, and a head in his head.
Mahood's head is solid, solid bone, solid as solid solid bone and solid like a fossil in the rock.
The head is unable to communicate with Mahood despite his attempts.
There is an unusual hell where you can't breathe, you see nothing, hear nothing, breathe nothing, you will be dead when you die. That's the reason the fire is burning at once.
Why do people burn the head like a fire?
Because of the burning fire.
Then why do those people burn the heads?
Because the heads are melting so fast for the flames to pass out of him.
What if I can see two people burning one head at one time?
That would be weird. The way he moves, the way he moves the head. The way that the eyes look, the way that the mouth gets covered in spit, how all the

Samuel Beckett believes that silence is the only form of silence that can be earned.
He believes that no matter what he says, the result will always be the same and he will never be silent and will never feel at peace.
There is no one left for Samuel Beckett to talk to and he feels compelled to continue talking to.

It's necessary at this point because his grandfather always insisted on him with his dead body.
That is the common reason for him to be absent from home.
One of the reasons on his condition is that his grandfather never gave him a drink or meat for him.
That would surely make him very restless and miserable with his old pain and old appetite.
It's necessary because many of his old ideas have

The inability to speak, the inability to be silent and/olitude are the three things that define my life.
In my life, I have had to make the best of being unable to speak due to these three things.
I did what I could to do but often gave up due to exhaustion.
When I was alone, in a place where no voice could reach me, I was unable to speak. I was unable to speak because I was unable to be silent. I was unable to be silent because I was unable to be silent. I was unable to be silent because I was unable to be silent. I was unable to be silent because I was unable to be silent. I was unable to be silent because I was unable to speak. I was unable to speak because I was unwilling to injure my voice by using profanity. I was unable to speak because I was unable to be silent.
