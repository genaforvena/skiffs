# skiffs ------------ Modular Language Model Architecture

## Overview
This project adopts a unique approach to natural language processing using a modular architecture of smaller language models (LMs). Inspired by Deleuzian philosophy, especially the shift from representative to rhizomatic thinking, this architecture aims to refine the output of general models through non-linear "clarification layers." These layers act as translators, transforming raw output into more precise and contextually appropriate responses without adhering to a rigid hierarchical structure.

## Philosophy
The guiding philosophy is informed by two key principles:
1. **Rhizomatic Thinking**: Inspired by Gilles Deleuze, this project rejects traditional linear and hierarchical models of thinking. Instead, it adopts a rhizomatic approach where each LM contributes to language processing in an interconnected, non-linear fashion.
2. **Simplification Through Clarification**: Echoing Wittgenstein's idea that clarity simplifies understanding, this project focuses on refining complex outputs into clearer, more effective communication.

## Architecture
The system consists of multiple smaller LMs, each serving as a node in a non-hierarchical network. These nodes collaborate in a rhizomatic structure, refining and transforming language outputs.
### Components
- **Context Keeper LLM**: Maintains the overarching narrative and context, adapting to the non-linear inputs and outputs of other modules.
- **Rhizomatic Clarifiers**: These are non-domain-specific LMs that transform language in innovative, non-linear ways, breaking away from conventional patterns.
- **Integration Layer**: Manages the interaction between modules, ensuring a cohesive and coherent output from the rhizomatic structure.

## Implementation Considerations
- Balancing the non-linear, interconnected nature of the system with the need for coherent outputs.
- Designing efficient integration strategies to minimize latency, especially important for real-time applications.
- Implementing quality control mechanisms to maintain relevance and appropriateness of outputs.

## Project Goals
- To challenge conventional NLP paradigms by demonstrating the effectiveness of a rhizomatic, non-hierarchical model structure.
- To create a system that not only is resource-efficient but also fosters creativity and innovation in language processing.
- To explore new frontiers in AI, particularly in how language is processed and generated, drawing inspiration from Deleuzian philosophy.
