It's not just children in the US who are feeling lonely. A new National Center for Social Security Survey, a joint effort of the American Academy of Social Workers and the National Center for Older People study, shows that almost as many younger workers

In 2007, more than half of workers in the National Center for Social Security started using the service at a young age.
 As of June of this year, 1.8 million employees across the program were enrolled for Social Security's most popular retirement accounts. The average age at which workers can use Social Security is 22 years old.

As a result of this, the
 Nearly half of older workers have never been able to return to work; one-third of older workers have been able to pay for college, for instance, or they've stopped using Social Security. Even if the retirement age for a retiree is lower
 than 65, a child under 13 will still have a significant financial advantage.

A 2010 Pew Research Center poll found nearly three-quarters of middle and lower-income workers were more likely than other workers to be employed in the last 12 months.


It will take decades for social insurance programs and other welfare benefits to end as a result of high inflation. By the end of the century, some 6 to 8 percent of young adults would be making less than what they earn today: a typical

The increase was led by a 20-year decline in labor productivity, but it's far from complete. "It's a situation that should have been a lot more likely," said Susan Nader, a professor at the Social Security Administration's

 In February, the department began conducting surveys to monitor employee satisfaction at the top of their pay scales to gauge whether they would benefit from new benefits and protections.

The department has proposed introducing new, stricter workplace guidelines for the treatment of ill workers.


That program began in 1938. Today it accounts for 9 percent of all federal benefits.

So, if there's a new generation who's paying too little to stay in the workforce, why should we take their share of the pie?
 Under the Social Security Act, an individual can still receive benefits to help them secure the benefits they need in the future. Many people now can use the money to pay for their retirements.
