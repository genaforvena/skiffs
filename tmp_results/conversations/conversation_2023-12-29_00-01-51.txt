>  The author says it has a purpose. What are they?  I guess in theory it does have an  actual purpose, but it's less useful as a tool of communication
2023-12-29 00:02:02
facebook/opt-125M:   What's your point, then?
2023-12-29 00:02:06
facebook/opt-125M:  and more of a resource to the actual author.
2023-12-29 00:02:11
facebook/opt-125M:   I can't say I agree with it, but it's my opinion anyway, as there are so many posts in the thread that I'm not sure how hard the data is to get.
2023-12-29 00:02:16
facebook/opt-125M: 
Thank you. That makes a lot more sense. I agree, it gives me more control.   I've thought about the book as well as it, and it definitely has a different meaning to me.
I always found it a bit
2023-12-29 00:02:23
facebook/opt-125M:  weird that they put a purpose on what is meant to be an interesting read but also make the book appear to be a more traditional study of the bible...  I guess I like the books better than the book itself so it is probably ok.
2023-12-29 00:02:29
facebook/opt-125M:  unhelpful that people are using "the author's books" and making assumptions to make a point. It is a very good read and I thoroughly enjoyed my first read through, but after I read the other posts here, I feel like I have

facebook/opt-125M:  to leave.  But still, great book.
I don't think this is an anti-Christian bias. There's much more to the story, but for the most part, it's just the same old thing - people can make up whatever
2023-12-29 00:02:40
facebook/opt-125M:  failed you as far as the discussion.
I didn't know people were going into what it is so early in the book. I never heard about the author before so I just figured people would just post stuff and read it.    It

facebook/opt-125M:  failed you as far as the discussion.
2023-12-29 00:02:49
facebook/opt-125M:  seems the people who were not going in to get the book started quickly did not get the book they should.  It does seem the author made up more and more lies until the time of the last book that they should have gotten it.
2023-12-29 00:02:54
facebook/opt-125M: 
This. It's like they feel like everyone else is already convinced. We need more of that in my opinion. I like that it makes sense.

2023-12-29 00:03:02
facebook/opt-125M:  but they are lazy people who aren't thinking clearly.
I think it's a little disappointing to read so much crap regarding the book when so many people like it and are able to enjoy it.
I've noticed that when they first started reading
2023-12-29 00:03:08
facebook/opt-125M:  it, it felt like it was already full of 'numbers.'
I don't know man. Some of my friends are saying that the book is going to become more about science rather than religion but I think that's fair enough.
As
2023-12-29 00:03:14
facebook/opt-125M:  it when the last chapter was finished it looked like a big ol' pile of books.   But the story now seems a little more real to me and I think that's a big thing. Especially given the popularity of the book and the fact
2023-12-29 00:03:17
facebook/opt-125M:  that they are both being published by a respected publisher.
2023-12-29 00:03:23
facebook/opt-125M:  that it has been a hit so far.
Yeah I wasn't entirely sure if I was missing something, but thanks for the reply
I'm not sure if the whole thing feels real, but I mean yeah it's not just about the main
2023-12-29 00:03:28
facebook/opt-125M:  thing but the whole process for sure. I'm sure there are some weird people in the game in particular I'd be upset about but I'd probably be the worst person to talk to, lol.
2023-12-29 00:03:34
facebook/opt-125M:  character. Everyone has their own agenda so it's a nice place to try to avoid feeling rushed.
Yea I don’t think there’s any real story to go around, it’s just more of an actual story
2023-12-29 00:03:39
facebook/opt-125M:  of how far she’s traveled/crossed the borders to and from her house.
Yeah, you're right. I'm just imagining it in my head.
2023-12-29 00:03:44
facebook/opt-125M:  for the characters to understand. I actually really enjoyed the writing for the most part, the character development and storyline was great and I found it rather amusing to read the characters when they were so completely devoid of any sense or any motivation.
2023-12-29 00:03:50
facebook/opt-125M: 
How is the writing for those games different from any other game? The writing is the same.
Some of the more well written characters in the series just aren't all that exciting, but the one who was definitely a favorite of mine in the

So, what's the game you're most excited about? Any other game like it? Let me know.

facebook/opt-125M:  famous examples:

3DS + Android phone and tablet = more gaming

Why would Nintendo even need to make a game, or be so open-ended, to people? It's obvious that everyone will play it and the hype will continue
2023-12-29 00:04:08
facebook/opt-125M:  Or how many of the other users here think you're so stupid?

Well, this time, I'm not going to say, "What's the best game I've ever played?" but instead, I'm going to say what I think
2023-12-29 00:04:11
facebook/opt-125M: 
Yeah I figured as much. Just trying to put it all out there.
2023-12-29 00:04:18
facebook/opt-125M:  Or how do you deal with that? What do you think of all this?   I haven't played in a while and I'm so sad that I've already lost my sanity haha. Thanks for the question though!
Yeah, you're
2023-12-29 00:04:23
facebook/opt-125M:  I mean I think this is one of the most serious things I've ever experienced in my life, so I need to keep an eye out.
2023-12-29 00:04:28
facebook/opt-125M:  No game is perfect, but the idea is to make it fun and for some good reason. Nintendo knows this, they're not afraid of releasing something in some game. Just because some are boring and have a great gameplay/ability, they don't
2023-12-29 00:04:37
facebook/opt-125M:  I don't know if this is really a good strategy (I just saw it in the news one time) but my favorite characters aren't just the ones you find in your own world, they're the ones that have those most interesting plots. So
2023-12-29 00:04:40
facebook/opt-125M:  I hope I didn't offend anyone here.
2023-12-29 00:04:46
facebook/opt-125M: 
I guess not. But even the easiest ones aren't necessarily the plot that has a plot at all. It's more like a random character, which is like a normal plot if it was just random, and then you only need to choose a

facebook/opt-125M: 

I've also been thinking of using the first guy. I know it's not a random character, but he has some connections that you won't find out about unless you want to play with him. I'm not sure if he's a
2023-12-29 00:05:00
facebook/opt-125M:  I really haven't done the research on how to use it yet, but there's a bit of a hint that it could work on any given day, but it seems to be fairly standard practice among couples that use it. So I feel it's

2023-12-29 00:05:18
facebook/opt-125M: 

It's the characters that I really wanted to play with when I started the series because I didn't have that many characters to start with. It's not like that we have like thousands of characters in it, it's just that a lot
2023-12-29 00:05:24
facebook/opt-125M:    I hope you aren't just playing with the character to find out.
He was just in the "fun" section, didn't make much of a connection to anyone I just wanted to play with him.   This is the worst
2023-12-29 00:05:30
facebook/opt-125M:        Thanks!
This is the one that made me actually laugh out loud. Thank you!
I know right, it was all about the weird things about playing with the character, not the actual game play.
Yeah
