The following is a quote by a guy I worked with who once said, "If you don't like your wife or your partner you'll always end up with some kid in hell who is worse than you and you can't get a job because you live in hell."


"He's an asshole, like John Candy, and he's got a fucking heart."

"And he has a fucking heart and this is how he feels when his wife is dead and he starts going to the hospital when she comes home from work when he has a little baby."

The idea of an open letter can be tough on a couple like the Clinton campaign, who have spent the last six months trying to convince their audience that her own actions are proof that she's not a womanizer.

Their argument is a response to a controversial New York Times op-ed last fall that read, "Donald Trump is in fact a womanizer. You should stop blaming women."
