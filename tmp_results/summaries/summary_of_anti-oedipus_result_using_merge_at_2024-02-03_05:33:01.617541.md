Maurice Blanchot presents a question at the level of the literary machine about how to produce and think about fragments whose sole relationship is sheer difference.
Disjunctions are inclusive and consumptions are transitions and processes of becoming, becoming, and returning.
The concept of desiring-production is a concept of multiplicity that is irreducible to any sort of unity.
We live in an age of partial objects, bricks that have been shattered to bits, and leftovers, and we no longer believe in the myth of the existence of fragments that are merely like pieces of an antique statue waiting to be glued back together to create. Instead, we understand fragmentation as a way to escape from the limitations of totality.
The idea of desiring-production is not limited to literature but can also be applied to other areas such as science, art, and philosophy.
In conclusion, the concept of desiring-production emphasizes the importance of multiplicity, difference, and the potential for new forms of thinking in an age where information is abundant and fragmented.

The essay by Maurice Blanchot suggests that literary works often consist of disparate fragments

In Proust's In Search of the Lost Time, we no longer believe in dull gray outlines of a colorless dialectic of evolution.
Instead, we believe in totalities that are peripheral and can be found alongside separate parts.
Proust describes the creation of Balzac's creation as a unity of various parts but not a totalization of them.
In his own oeuvre, Balzac describes each part of his creation as an "inspired fragment composed separately."
In the literary machine that is the novel, we no longer believe in the mechanical construction of characters and plots with all their separate parts.
Instead, we believe in the totalizing influence of a complex and integrated whole.
Proust's "In Search of the Lost Time" is an ode to the totality of human life, with its many fragments and pieces.
The book describes how these different parts work together to create a unified whole that makes up our lives.
This idea is also

Proust's work is described as a schizoid work.
According to Proust, the rigors of the law are only an apparent expression of the protest of the One and their real object is the dissolution of fragmented universes.
The law does not unify anything in a single Whole, but maps out the divergences, dispersions, and exploding fragments of a fragmented universe.
Despite the apparent guilt of the author, the apparent theme of guilt is implied to be a cover-up for a more deeply rooted, deeper-rooted attitude.
This apparent guilt is tightly interwoven with a completely different theme totally contradicting it.
ProuSt's work has a strong theme of guilt and blame but also a very strong theme of freedom and self-actualization.
The author uses the law as a metaphor for his own life, which he describes in a way that makes apparent the conflicts between apparent guilt and apparent freedom, which are connected by an underlying attitude of self-fulfillment.
Proust's work is often described as being about the search for the meaning of human existence and the struggle to find our place within it.
The author

In Jn Search of Lost Time, Joyce describes the journey on the train as a "transversal" where the passenger traces a path from one window to another to draw together and reweave intermittent and opposite fragments.
This process of reweaving is referred to by Joyce as "re-embodying".
Joyce believes that the body without organs is produced in its own particular place within the process of production, alongside other parts that it does not unify nor totalize.
The body operates on these parts, bringing about transverse communications, transfinite summarizations, and transcursive inscriptions.
These inscriptions are continually intersected by functional breaks of partial objects, which allow them to be rewoven.
These broken parts do not have any intrinsic meaning or function; they are simply a collection of disjointed fragments.
The body without organs is a surface that does not represent anything but is present and exists in its own right.
It can only be revealed through a process of detachment from the structures and organizations that surround it and impede its operation.

Melanie Klein is responsible for the discovery of partial objects, but she fails to grasp the logic of these objects because she perceives them as fantasies and judges them from the point of view of consumption rather than production.
Melanie explains these partial objects in terms of causal mechanisms (introjection and projection), mechanical mechanisms that produce certain effects (gratification and frustration), and mechanisms of expression (good or bad).
Despite her explanations, Melanie does not connect these objects to a real process of production such as desiring-machines and she does not consider the role of desire and desire in mechanics.
There is no mechanism or vitalism that can explain the evolution of drives that would cause these partial objects to change over time. This limitation prevents Klein from fully understanding the nature of desire and its role in shaping the psyche.

She believes that schizoparanoid partial objects are related to a whole, either to an original whole or to a final, depressive stage (the complete Object).
Partial objects derive from (preleves sur) global persons and play a significant role in totalities aimed at integrating the ego, the object, and drives later in life.
She also believes that the concept of the pre-oedipal, or "pre-Oedipal", has a significant and potentially destructive role in the production of desire.
The concepts of the ego and the object relation between the mother, the father, and the father form the original type of object relation. The mother is an extension of the self (the ego), as well as a primary source of gratification for the child. In the case of a "good" mother, the infant will feel that she is available to gratify his needs at any given time; he feels secure in this situation and develops an early sense of trust in people around him.
The child's first relationship with the other is usually one-sided, as he relies on the mother for all physical needs (

Melanie Klein considers desire from the point of view of the whole, global persons, and complete objects.
Melanie is a member of the International Psycho-Analytic Association, which has a door with the inscription "Let no one enter who does not believe in Oedipus."
Mel Melanie uses partial objects to shatter the iron collar of Oed.
She describes her methods for shattering Oed's collar, which include water Oed down, miniaturizing it, finding everywhere, extending it to the earliest years of life, and forcing Oed into the past.
The collars of children are more "solid" than those of adults, but in a similar way they have the ability to be shattered or disempowered by these methods.
She compares the work she does with Oed to that which Freud did for her as an infant. She says that this is her personal story of Oed, and it is not meant to be considered "objective."
Freud said that his patients were like his children. Melanie describes how

Dick left the train and ran into a space between the outer and inner doors of the room.
I explained to him that he was inside a dark room and inside a "mummy."
Dick picked up the train again and ran back into the space.
While in the dark room, Dick asked a nurse for help.
During his analysis, Dick discovered the wash-basin as symbolic of the mother's body and displayed an extraordinary dread of being wetted with water.
In the context of psychoanalysis, the concept of "desiring-machines" is reduced to parental images and the logic of partial objects.
It could also be that she was trying to create a space between herself and her son, which would allow her to have some control over him.
The nurse asked Dick for his name and he replied with the word "Dick." The nurse then realized that the person in the dark room was not her husband but rather her son.
The nurse could also be a symbolic representation of Dick's mother, who is present in the image through the wash-basin

Jung and Freud had a disagreement about the nature of partial objects and their relationship to the Oedipal figure.
Jung argued that partial objects are not representations of parental figures or the basic patterns of family relations.
Instead, Jung sees partial objects as parts of desiring-machines, having to do with a process and relations of production that are irreducible and prior to anything that may be made to conform to such figures.
In Jung's view, children's games are not just about playing house, but also about playing different roles such as being a magician, a cowboy, a cop, a robber, a train, or a little car.
The relationship between partial objects, parental figures and the Oedipus complex is more complicated than that of Freud.
Freud's focus on the Oedipal figure is limited to its role in early development. The part of the Oedipal complex that develops at around four years old is related to sexual feelings and drives.
In contrast, Jung sees the Oedipal complex as being much older than that and also having a more diverse function than Freud believed.
According to Jung, the Oedipus

Sigmund Freud and Jung have a disagreement on a particular point.
They both share the belief that the libido cannot invest in social or metaphysical fields without some sort of mediation.
Jung and Freud believe that the child lives among partial objects and perceives these partial objects as representations of his parents.
The child moves about like a machine, using one of his legs as an oar, exploring various rooms such as 46 ANTLOEDIPUS, the kitchen, the study, and toy cars.
Both Jung and Freud agree that the parents of the child are present all the time and the child would have nothing without them. However, they disagree on whether it is better to live with both parents or a single parent. 
Jung believes that living with both parents helps the child develop into a more well-rounded person as he/she will have various people to learn from. Freud believes that it is better for a child to live with one parent as this allows the child to build a stronger bond with their chosen parent, which in turn

Ray Bradbury describes the nursery as a place where desiring-production and group fantasy occur, where the only connection is that between partial objects and agents.
The child lives with his family around the clock and lives within the bosom of this family from the very first days of his life.
In Ray Bradbury's nursery, the child lives in a family environment where he has a strong emotional attachment to his family.
Lindner's painting draws attention to the importance of parents and the attachment of children to their mothers and fathers.
Oedipus is a character in Ray Brad's nursery.
Ray Brad's description of the nursery suggests that the child begins having an amazing nonfamilial experience that psychoanalysis never mentions.
The child enters the world with certain innate dispositions, such as attachment to his mother and the ability to perceive beauty.
There are also a number of works in which he delves deeply into the psychology of family relationships and childhood, including "The Nursery" (1954), a playful description of the nursery, and "In the Nursery" (1962).
In his short story

The concept of the Oedipal triangulation is presented as a type of inscription for experiences and the workings of mechanisms.
The child re/ates the breast as a partial object to the person of his mother and constantly watches the expression on his mother's face.
In this context, the term "relate" does not designate a natural productive relationship but rather an inscription within the process of inscription.
From a very early age, the child has a wide-ranging life of desire, including nonfamilial relations with objects and machines of desire that are not related to his parents. This includes sexual desire.
The Oedipal Triangulation is based on this fact, suggesting that as the child grows older, these desires become more complex and intertwined within familial relationships. The triangulation becomes a mechanism for exploring and understanding these desires.
At first, the child sees their parent in each of his desired objects and associates the parent with those objects. Then, as he becomes more aware of the parent's identity and moves toward adolescence, this association is challenged when the

Ever since the age of eight years old, I have always wondered who I am, what I was, and why I am alive.
I remember asking questions about existence, to be alive, and what it means to be conscious of oneself breathing.
At the ages of six, I was given a chocolate bar by a woman known as "mommy" who asked me if I liked being alive and if I enjoyed it.
The child is a metaphysical being and is not related to their parents.
This question is not formulated in terms of her, but within the interplay of being alive, conscious of one's breathing, inhaling myself, and related to the woman named mommy.
Mommy is a loving, caring person who wants me to be happy, and she also wants me to have a good life.
She is not my mother, but rather someone who is nurturing and supportive of me as I grow older.
In this context, the question is formulated in terms of the relationship between the child and their caregiver.
The caregiver's concern for the child's happiness and well-being is evident in her question about whether the

The Oedipus complex is a framework for understanding childhood and the production of the unconscious.
The unconscious produces itself within the identity of nature and man within the process of production.
Artaud, a socialist thinker, discovered the unity of man and nature within the processes of production and discovered the independence of the child from its parents.
In the Cartesian cogito, the child discovers that it has no parents and discovers its independence from an indefinite parental regression.
According to Artaud, the unconscio us is an orphan and the child's identity is within the identities of nature, man, and nature.
There is a confusion between the meanings of "process" and "process": one refers to an act of production that is continuous and always ongoing, while the other refers to an organized and linear progression of actions or events.
The unconscious does not produce itself but rather emerges from an endless process of self-production.
Artaud's discovery of the unity of man and nature within processes of production led him to the idea that the child discovers its independence from parents, while Lacan saw the unconscious as a structure produced by language.

H. D. Lawrence has reservations about psychoanalysis, perceiving it as restricting sexuality and stifling it.
Lawrence perceives psychoanalysis as creating a repugnant artifical triangle and restricting the production of desire, turning it into a "dirty little secret," a family secret, and a private theater rather than a production of nature and production.
Despite his reservations, Lawrence has an instinctive impression that sexuality possesses more power or potentiality than psychoanalysis.
According to Lawrence, the dirty little secret of Oedipus-the-modern-tyrant benefited little from having been "disinfected" by psychoanalytic interpretation, and he suggests that the psychoanalytic process might have been more fruitful if it had not tried to disinfect it.
Lawrence also believes that sexuality is closely tied to nature and creativity, which makes him skeptical of psychoanalysis's attempts to control or suppress it. He argues that sexual desire is a natural part of the human experience and cannot be fully understood or controlled through psychological analysis. 

The relationship between madness and the family can be traced back to a development that affected bourgeois society in the 19th century.
Foucault suggests that the family was entrusted with functions that became the measuring rod of the responsibility of its members and their possible guilt.
According to Foucault, psychoanalysis is reviving an age-old tendency to humble, demean, and make people feel guilty.
Despite the fact that psychoanalysis cloaks insanity in the mantle of a "parental complex," and regards the patterns of self-punishment resulting from Oedipus as a confession of guilt, it is not considered radical or innovative.
Foucault points out that what he calls the "authority" which has been ascribed to psychoanalysis over the past half century did not originate with Sigmund Freud and his followers: rather it was inherited from the era before the 18th century, when madness had its own particular social role as a punishment.
Foucault makes a distinction between two types of insanity: the "madness of the family" and "the madness of the community."

Oedipus is the figure of the daddy-mommy-me triangle, a familial constellation.
Psychoanalytic theory considers the concept of the "nuclear complex" as a dogma of Oedipos.
The nuclear complex is inseparable from a concept of a "gended generalized Oed," which is a pre-Oedipal concept.
Although Freud's Oedipus complex has been the most influential model for understanding psychoanalysis, it has its limitations.
One limitation is that the Oedipus complex applies to only heterosexuals and has not been extended to include homosexuals or bisexuals.
The other main criticism of the Oedipal complex theory is that it tends to be reductionist in nature (as in "the father wants to kill his son") by simplifying things rather than attempting to explore

The distinction between the Imaginary* and the Symbolic* allows the emergence of an Oedipal structure, a system of positions and functions that do not conform to the variable figure of those who occupy them in a given social or pathological formation.
The Oedipus (3 + 1) is a structural structure that performs all the possible triangulations by distributing desire, its object, and the law within a given domain.
Oedipalization, neurosis, and exo oEDipal phenomena are discussed.
"The imaginary is not the same as imaginary."
Imaginary: A mental process or product that is not symbolic but serves as a foundation for it. (Lacan)
* The Symbolic: Represents the order of language and culture through which individuals experience meaning.
* The Imaginary: Represents the subject's perception of their own body and environment, shaped by their mirror image and the Other.
The Real: The inherent

The concept of "foreclosure" suggests a specific structural deficiency in the Oedipal organization.
One of Jacques Lacan's disciples proposes to investigate the role of Oedipus in psychoses and the nature of psychotic pregenitality.
Lacan's previous criticism of OEDipus was perceived as superficial and petty, focusing on an imaginary character and its role of parental figures.
The disciples propose to focus on the role and nature of the "Oedipal" organization and the forms of the pregeneritality of psychoses.
They propose to explore the concept of a "desiring-production" in order to investigate OEDipus' place in the process of desiring-production.
The disciples intend to focus on the role that Oedipus plays in the desiring-production and its relation to the pregenitality.
They propose to study how this "desiring-production" is formed by the pregeneralization process as well as the role of OEDipus in the "desiring-production".
The disciples intend to
