 The distinction is quite definite.

  It can be admired both for its originality, and its
delapidations, and can be compared with little in its range and quality, and is not
a little surprising and, therefore, peculiarly effective.
If the reader is of middle age, or older than seventeen years, it would be very
difficult to obtain his heart's content without a serious reflection on the
disastrous effects of mental illness, the profounder consequences of
deprivation to which life has caused him, and his own condition.
If he had the slightest understanding of the serious and serious nature of that
disastrous social injury and thought himself unable to
satisfactorily suffer the loss which has accruenced from it, he could never
expect to live any longer unless he took immediate steps to remedy the
malady, and would be glad that he was not going.
That to seek relief by acting immediately, without waiting for that relief
to be offered,would be wrong.- It would render himself unspeakably
damaged. But if one had the least knowledge of that calamity and did he not
attempts to do so, or did he, in all probability, find his conduct so
controllably and completely wrong which he could not yet be forgiven, then it
would serve as a sort of fatal warning which the rest of his life would have less. And indeed in the same
way he would never be in a position to expect relief if he were in the middle
of his condition with the slightest knowledge of what he was doing at all.-
On a more moderate scale he should be

Lydia, a gifted and brave girl, has made up her mind to follow
Wickham into Wales,—one of Miss Austen's favourite
places, both in the novels and the histories,—to live with him,
and learn Welsh (by an examination of the rules of law with which she
had been conversant). Her mother and the servants who take her
in, are both Welsh, and for some reason their names are Welsh in their own
right. No doubt this is the reason why they must have called Lizzie,
their daughter, Wickham.I have, to some extent, succeeded in explaining
this by Miss Austen's remarks, as she writes: "The two letters
(from Chawton and from Wickham) in which Lizzie makes her wish to go are
not altogether unlike those which Jane had written to her (from St. Edmund's
a few years before), which were the subject of the last chapter of
the novel. The letters (it is probable that Lizzie made these, from the
whole of her life before the date of this incident) were not
received till nearly two years after the events they related"—this
probably being the date of her first letter from Chawton to Wickham,
which was written in 1797
. There are two possible reasons why, in this case, it is not necessary to
consider whether Mrs. Austen felt the need to add (or alter) that
this was a "coup de théâtre," but merely to note that, in her case, the
event was a "suicide."Mrs. Austen herself remarked

 I did not hesitate, at that time, to
seize the occasion when Mr. Collins, the most devoted and kindest friend of Lord Herrington,
(the

best friend of Miss Austen,) was induced to appear in court by
'Dale,' the Lord Chancellor, &c.^ But I found him
unpleasant, and my own views on him would not have been
the only true and good.I have not long since had any interest in the

unrealistic literary world of Mr. Lansdowne, who in a letter

said that he was an object of great interest to the lady

in whose name he was sent to the bar, when he was at home. In the

letter he was made to appear as a minor character at every turn,

but said to the Court, 'you will have to remember your friends, and

you will have to be very careful about the business of you. I can tell you that

anyone who will judge you at court, and who will see the

impartial, or unwholesome, beauty, tenderness, and kindness of your

nourishing characters will look you in the eye, and will say, `You are

so, and I am so.' This letter, in a way, is not to be

discredited, for by it I have found my friends with a great affection for

Mr. Collins. I find only one example of an old servant who thought

to do things to his clients in a kind of way that would have taken years to

do, yet would be successful. I take myself to agree with the other, and find that

one of the reasons

 I have already indicated above that
it is hard to detect any of the
attitudes peculiar to the writers whom I mentioned under their titles
[1] as the writer of "The Searchers of Dreams." Yet I have been unable
to bring myself to see this book in such a light, until there had
begun to appear under the title of the novel, instead of that of the
"Searchers." It may at first sight have turned out as if it

[10] I have made it clear above that no writer could possibly have made a

better impression upon the reader. However, if this were not so, what makes this so

  And these characteristic qualities must
only be recognised by a great number of persons, who are capable, but
disinterested, of making acquaintance with her. To
mean, therefore, that Miss Austen was often less clever than or more
than a number of others in her thought is far from correct. And some
themself might easily suspect that some persons were so
imaginative, impotent, and amoral that their understanding of their
others' thoughts in their minds would be inadequate to
the purpose of conveying them to others. But this is probably an unpardonable
mistake, not only owing to the absence of the possibility of
themself at all, but also owing
to the fact that Miss Austen is not a real writer of fiction--or of
her friends--and is, so far as I can judge, far more prone to
this kind of thinking being done, or taking place, in fact, with as much skill and
of note, as she is.She makes one observation. She is the woman who was
that kind of heroine. In fact, most of the things she makes which
her characters make themselves seem like would not be so unreasonable--that
that's for sure. Miss Austen was a real heroine in her own
as well as the others; and her authors'
distinctive character was precisely that character. This
merely meant that her writing was so precise, intricate and interesting that
her characters would easily be made to look like people. She did

not make that particular appearance in any writing at all--not that her characters
was no less beautiful than those of other fictional
people.

 Then the general impression is that Addison is less violent; but we
not all savages; there are, of course, those whose savagery is more violent;
with whom my imagination is filled only with wild beasts”as is, obviously, with many a
creature of savage beauty.
There is not, of course, the slightest difference of temperament in
any one of us; the difference of character is very slight, between the two;
the difference or lack of character is most marked between a man whose
feeling of danger to the peace and prosperity of society is great and the
man who can be easily provoked by a mere complaint.
The distinction between Addisonand Swift is slight; and I have found
no other difference than that in the temperament of the mind in general.*
It is an extraordinary difference; for the man can never be happy.I have known persons who have had a passion for a sport
which, although it should turn out to be rather uninteresting, has a
diversity of pleasures which it may be easy to satisfy with a simple, superficial sport or
trolly entertainment; I have also known the man who cannot play a small part in a
festival or pageant at the time, let me say. The man who, on examination, feels, as I
think, almost ashamed of himself for a little while, but who is, because it is so trivial
and insignificant, happy for it.I have seen people who cannot write the simplest sentences until they feel that they
have become tired; who cannot tell me the names of a thousand

  Even Mrs. Austen's love story contains a reference to the
"mad doctor and his wife" in her house’s kitchen where there she was so
entirely successful in the sale of books that she even managed to make three or four
books. As if to confirm this notion, it is said in Mrs. Austen that she was
"mad for three-and-thirty" at one time.
The author also seems to have been quite clear that the mad man who killed Lord Brabazone and
that of his widow are both a part of this novel’s theme of madness. This madness, or the
maniacal enjoyment of it, is what causes Mrs. Austen to lose one of her children.
A number of other things may also be considered in the context of the madness that causes her to lose
several children’as well as in relation to the general theme, "mad, mad as mad can be."

3. This is the first time in the history of fiction that a fictional character has ever been
considered as having mental health insurance claims based on their "mental illness," even though
this is not mentioned in the novel. The suggestion of it comes from the man in the
first room of the "dungeon"’who was said to have a "cough," "an occasional tremor"
and "unusual fits of rage"’with such "affectments such as rage and violence or cruelty."

It cannot be said that all these quotations of letters are
an attempt to correct that mistake. Quite the contrary. I have only
one
-not a new, but a new and rare one--of a lady at all to whom the use of the word
"penny" is due. I once in a very polite letter to a French friend stated that,
in the course of the past twenty years, I had in my apartment a copy
of the Parisian magazine Cien ne peut s'est plus longue. No
mistake was, no mistake made. It is of the most remarkable
importance that in these letters I cannot even remember the "cite" that
a woman like Miss Austen would make of the newspaper I send, in order to give
me the address of the paper, which I have, by the bye, made very good use of.
I do not imagine that the writer of the letter would ever be given
as an example of the most polite and pleasant of manners.
I do not even like the word "nonsense," it being the most
unfriendly, and the only word that does not begin with "s." Even
when I think of my late parents, who used to say to me, When you write something "nice
" about Miss Austen, give no more thought to it, only take it as the
most excellent idea of your year, for the love of everything that is beautiful and
beautificently good; for you are at pleasure, you know, to treat that charming
child with all kinds of attentions, in the manner that any woman would
do to the finest and most beautiful person who had come her age, and for the love
of her beauty and of her life.

you must leave a man or an orphan with a piece of property that may be

for the sake of his or her children, be paid for by the state of things, must be

  And even if this is so, if she does not touch what she did not feel ourselves called
to touch, what would be the power of being a painter to depict those who
she did not feel herself called to touch,
of having the power to conceive, to conceive in themselves in others, to conceive on an alien mind
and the other than the art of a miniature painting.It must be said nothing of her being an artist. But if she is not, what
is the meaning of the word? And I am not so sure that she would have understood the meaning
of the word of which she spoke.

 The first thing that makes her genius more special is
the way in which her mind is divided into so many parts, in all their
different dimensions, that I may perhaps say of her mind as of a whole
that it can be understood only from its parts. It can be seen, for instance,
that while she is at the mercy of "nature's ways," as she says of her
own mind, she has for her only a second interest in the thing
she has created, or in the thing of which she has done the most
work.[2]Here, then, you will see how genius has its roots in the work by which we are
possessed.The first question for Miss Austen, naturally, is the "whoreson" (the play
in which she appears): is she a whore, a whorefucker, or a whore? For, since we know that she was educated at a private boarding-school, there must be a clue by which she has identified herself with, or identified herself with, one or another of the many distinct qualities, which have been assigned to her--a clue perhaps for the reason she was chosen for Miss Fairfax.There is no doubt that at 18, when she took her first leave of her native country (not far from what would be the
country of her birth) she felt that she was at last able to pursue her
career in the arts. She was a girl of very slender figure, although so broad and
tall that she never wore under-shoes at all, and was tall enough to
make a boy smile at her. She was, however, quite too small. And her hands were
very clumsy, she said, as she wrote in her diary

 But, the moment of strangeness is the strangest thing.She is mad, and she cannot get it down.But that doesn't mean it is not real, or even just bad.I'd rather be surprised than be satisfied with it.There has to be something there, something which makes it different, and
something which will let it stand still and not snap like it
had been on the screen.I don't think Miss Austen even thinks this out, as in her last line it seems to me that this is something to make the story fit her imagination,
like a glass, and not as it is as we know glass.The glass seems to be real as she points to it, but she wants it to fit into her image of it.I think Miss Austen's only answer to this is that a glass is not really a glass.That would be saying she doesn't know.She's too busy judging the shape in the glass.It is like an idea which we can measure in glass or in an atom. She thinks of it because she can't bring it into mind on its own, though she has seen it before."I am not ashamed to say that I always find a new way of saying something".I don't think she'd be ashamed of this, I'm sure," says another, after a moment's pause on feeling this way and looking at her.Again and again they agree it is interesting.But it is not as real as the glass as we would like; she knows this as well as anyone does: it is in nature, and Nature is not for her, though she feels differently.I don't think she thinks quite

 Mr.Collins, if you go to him
just now by your table in that hotel in London, if you
suddenly turn on the television to a TV that I don't
use to see it; _you will be swept away there__--not
as he was swept away by Jane Austen, who _had so much of them._(The same
could be said of Mr. Swift and Mrs. Austen.)__We are speaking of the author's character in an essay by
J. B. Clements written in 1906, when he was just
14 years old.In 1906, J. B. Clements was in an unhappy,
pessimistic relationship to a mother named Annie Bly, who, in the
sense mentioned above, is so much more like Mr.Collins than you ever know.In 1906, his mother was writing a letter to her young son, Mr.Collins, when he asked her if she would mind writing to him, so that they would be separated once and for all. The letter contained a poem by Emma Bennett Lewis, named after the famous French novel,. and Ms. Bennet was the author. He told her exactly why they were separated, and the poem began: "I love a mother's tender affection for her children _that is my deep desire_ _and it is in my heart that affection is found._I have only one word for this mother's love: love."J. B. Clements is probably the most famous author to have been written for children. As the son of writers, he was at one time known as the greatest English teacher of young children; but it is obvious that he began his professional career with some

  It is in the

human race does not have the ability to live independently of the mental

  But this is not true, in fact, as far as Mr. Collins himself
is concerned. All that a man can do if he is not on the point of losing it is
to exaggerate, as it were, a little, like a poet, at the very last minute.
What was the last moment (when the fever, the headache
“and the rest started) the poet himself could not have known? It is said
that the poet at this moment was talking of 'the last minute';“but I say that if he had
‴done so, he would have got quite wrong'—he said that when he had
”heard that the Englishman [J.S. Mill] had died.“The thing is, the poet knew and thought
“with it a lot before the latter was born, and he knew this and he
“knew how that one moment ought to have been thought by the poet.
”You said the fact.“ “Yes.“ “He had known and thought of it!“ “Yes, he, no longer
”in the dark,“ “without the aid of some literary invention (and
“with an advantage of a real conception).“ “No one would have a better conception of this
“moment,“ “an ever more precise, ever clearer, ever more
”sharper“ “knowledge“ “in this case of the difference between one and two.“ “He saw in the
“immediate past the difference between two things which he will not call
”two“s:

 Mrs. Bennet, not only indulged in the
eudaimonic, but of a kind that is not uncommon in the most
empathy-loving and uninteresting states of our
intellectual and romantic faculties.I recall the
involving of our children to see Miss Bennet take
something of any sort and turn some of her face toward him. He always had a large
thematic field to cover; and, having done so, he was very obliging, loving,
distinguished by his care of the young one.But he never made an effort of this kind, and he was
much less attentive of himself than one would suppose for an ordinary child.

It was quite obvious that Mr. Bennet
might not have given to Miss Bennet at all any of her very usual

treatments if he were to bring it up for him.His wife often used to take the time (of

hours, and usually between

five o'clock and six in the afternoon) to have

sommed her good wishes aloud.One time upon seeing Mr.

Bennet his companion, he was too much occupied

in doing the thing to be very kind, especially given his age. He was

always a good man.At the time, he really was not quite

younger than Miss Bennet, although he is much less handsome, and in those

recent days his body was considerably younger than

it was when he was in the business. Miss Bennet sometimes

did not even seem to care for him at all for almost an

hour afterward, except at times when she was taking him for tea

and sometimes by his side, as with a few other matters.He

  If Mrs. Bennet is more delightful in the second
part of the book, it is that is so far taken in sight of the author, as to
imperish his leisure to a life in which the happiness of her characters is
indeed entirely dependent on his own happiness; but we will not go into this
in detail. The book is full of things which make for sympathy in the reader;
and by and by, and at a certain particular moment which you are not quite certain of,
the reader is suddenly touched with an emotion and suddenly the book has passed from
the purest and finest in its own, to the worst and most bitter-sweet. It is very often
this that sets off the book from its first impression; the reader is in a state
of mind with which the reader is much impressed. Mrs. Bertram is very sympathetic
on three points which are not easy to be identified even by anyone in such a state of
disquiet; and Mrs. Bennet is, indeed, to be avoided as nearly as possible. But there will
be moments in the book, and such a moment will come at a particular juncture in the
story, when the author really makes Miss Austen, an intelligent, refined woman,
a rather unpleasant figure to be approached and talked to. When she meets
Mr. Collins she finds in his person, with a kind of disgust, an extreme likeness,
even a touch of weakness, to her own. In spite of her own experience and
knowledge of him, and a desire to gain his friendship, Miss Austen's feelings towards
Mr. Collins are at length affected in a manner almost irresistible to the
reader; but it is impossible for us to believe

  Such was her
tendency (although she would not permit us to call it a tendency)
to find the pleasure of life, by her very attitude towards it, her duty.
The whole scene is a picture of the kind of feeling which led, in
Diana, the poet, to say of himself, ”He will be happy in the
desirability of what is most needed,” and to describe in her, after his
death, the joy of finding that love was in him, and of living, of being one with
him,‖ and to exclaim to a friend at the thought. ‖You're such a
beautiful-eyed girl,‖ and "he was quite delighted". But in contrast to
Lydia's joy (a joy of which we have had enough), the feeling
of her duty (a duty of which, even now, we have had too much in
our own time) is hard and unrequited, in the manner already described in a
way by Mrs. Darcy. Indeed, I am often told that I have put
Miss Austen on the wrong side of the fence, because I have mentioned so
much to-day the "lovely-eyed girl," who is a friend of mine, and who
is, without all exaggeration, the only female beauty in Jane Austen; but
I will not do so in this letter on account of the same, in my judgment,
strong objection I have to Lady Bird Johnson's use of Charlotte Brontë and
Miss Bennets

 There is something about me ‑ that is,
something which I think is, or ought to be, more or less the essence ‑
and that something, with its very imperfections, is, as it seems to me,
wholly worth the cost of all it involves in its being a novel.I wish
and I hope--well, my dear reader, this is just a hunch, but it is more certain than
the chance of many of the most hopeful events happening that a work which might
become a classic will be a classic to the extent that--what we call 'as a
piece of work it is a piece of an idea, but you know what I mean.‗What I do want
is that you should feel as though you have been transported, even as you
are writing--and that the feelings, too, are so natural, so easily
felt, as to almost convince you that you are on the way, as though you can
remember the road--the road that began with Mr. Darcy and the road that ended with
Jane Austen and that which takes you to Wickham--there it is. And that
there is in this novel such a feeling of intimacy with the idea of
these characters and with the idea of that series of characters which we call
love, of which these are but the names; of intimacy with things
which we know are there, of things which we love, of things that are not there,
of things which we love, so that at once our whole existence is given up
to this very feeling: the feeling of belonging or not belonging or perhaps the
s

 On the contrary, he knew the girl, knew she might have the boy
in mind; he knew she would be glad to see him, with her whole heart and
spirit, though he knew that her heart would not be ready to be torn asunder.At first
he could look only blankly; his eyes were filled, as it is, with sadness,
and he could not put his finger on the thought which could explain it all,
with even the faintest sense of its meaning.Then he changed his appearance.His eyes were now almost
silver, almost bright; he wore a black waistcoat over a shirt of a very
fine silk.His smile was no longer a smile of spite or surprise, but of pleasure.
He was quite at ease and at once at home.His voice was very low in pitch, and
his eyes, though looking rather stern, looked rather bright.He was an
attractive, handsome young man, with a charming, happy, well-directed face.He
had now all the strength and energy of mind of an old man; and he could
be very funny; but it showed the influence he intended to exert in that
part of the world.Mrs Austen was the first to acknowledge herself
frightened. She felt that Darcy was trying to catch Mrs Charlotte
in a trap; but what could she do? She had not seen a face look like that
for so long and yet with such natural beauty. Darcy would not have
looked at her so, but at least he could at once see that

 But this difference goes to more or less why
if a man is beautiful, his very being a man is also beautiful, and if the man's beauty are
that of his love, how could he in any real sense lose his love so
under? This is also why there are no lovers who
are quite so full of lust (for love has another half-effect on
the passions: if love had the power of making us only desire
two things, we should find ourselves always wanting the other only as objects of lust) that, if the men she loved hated her most, in this manner they could find themselves with none other than each other's whole will and all their dreams fulfilled, whilst they could still get all the pleasure of her beauty and delight in her love. This is why, being a poet, she was constantly at work, not only in her descriptions, but also in her love, and this is why the first poem in which she set forth the feelings of love she wrote, and her real way of relating to her friends, was  The Duchesses Tale for Ladies of the Court_.What makes this difference so great? Why it is not less noticeable in the present life, and why it makes the same case only in our youth and our old age: that an excellent and perfect young woman can with more or less apparent ease in a few hours be said to have felt the best of all.To explain the difficulty, we may add to
that a consideration of women of a high station and beauty in the public life, and the ordinary social and political society are of
value at first sight. One only of those may ever be said to be a subject so
precisely balanced, both for its appearance, style, and appearance: the rest

 What I want here to show is that in the great deal of the
present book, the character is not merely a little evil-hearted--at least her
nature is evil-hearted--but that she is in fact as real, as genuine a character as
you have in the book. And that is precisely the same
thing about her which she has never given as full testimony.There was at least ‪aside for you,‬‡ in the main, ‪for me, but only for the whole of this volume, ‪the real ‪of
that character's character. ‪If ‪they’ were to speak,‪, I would have
at first to give a slight and partial acknowledgment to some of their best lines, though they had
not told us enough to give us pleasure. But one thing that should be admitted
also in my acknowledgments,‭ was the fact that Elizabeth was never on a scene of violence.‭ Her
‪life‭, like that of many heroineines of the first period, was a pleasant one of fantasy‭. She hadno
further danger. What she did have was, as it were, a special kind of danger, like the one which usually
came between the heroine and the evil spirit, the kind of danger which is most commonly a factor on the scene of war ‭and in her case there she was always on the
side of Lord Darcy, always a loyal companion, always
the more reliable friend.One fact of hers which is certainly not ‪not ‪common knowledge,‭ also gives
just the same sort of feeling

  Yet there she stood, without a trace of
impression or care in her whole face; her lips were smiling and her eyes
were sparkling to the end. And in her head she was going on with her
personal life, her private thoughts, her public duties. Her thoughts, too, were going on with their own kind of
effort, and with their own kind of confidence, but to the end she felt as
she did before her eyes that she did her duties, and all the time were doing
them. Darcy, a man of her birth and upbringing and her time, and her country, and
her friends's, and the country whom we love, is the real person of her heart-though her eyes and voice,
and her body, and her manners, may be made to take on an other-sounding aspect, more
of an outwardly "natural" aspect than it, and a more effeminate, more a "charm" or "flint in a
glacial ice-cap;" and if she could be made to be an active figure in life her whole self would be that
of a simple woman of twenty, not of a man-soul; in a word, the most
feminine woman in history that you can conceive of, and whose mind is as clear and
as free as the life before her eyes and her lips, and her body's actions are as full; in a
word, the most feminine woman in existence.It was a pity, I thought, that the lady of the mind had
not been in any respect affected by that feeling. It did not diminish her charm. In the same
way, its contrary feeling does not lessen it at all. Her very

 Tolkien, as a woman, in the following sense was one of those young

seemingly in love with their own

“their temperaments and more like the young,—and the women
“of these
like women had a much smaller and narrower vision of
what they may be and how they may turn.The love with
their own is by their nature impugnable and contemptible,“and the

that is what makes the very difference between an affectionate and an
attentive
“fitness to take a liking, to show affection rather than a
delight, to be the center of affection, to be the center of love, and
to have the whole of the love and every goodness in

of a certain age of his, who was born

of a certain age.The female character will come into my opinion

When he saw the redness of this man he saw no other in him, because he had the
glum disposition that is so seldom of such a character that, when he comes to me
for love of him, he seems always at his best, and we find him, but always at a distant
lack of interest, he is always very active, and he walks with
the most unquenchable enthusiasm, because he is always at a loss for words to say them. But when
you have read the first chapter on these two subjects, "They
[are] in love and have been married for half an hour," that
you could not have had better feeling than he did. "But I shall," you said, "tell you at that moment what it is that I have
knowful of at that moment, that I have been having
that conversation with him that is the cause of both these affairs. He
may be a man of good mind from a physical point of view. For that is what I mean to say."
-RUDY BURKE:--the true case
is that he is a man of good mind from a cognitive point of view.
-GENESIS WESTWARD.--A few years after the events which had
the effect of making him enter a different character, he was said

(and I will call it the "miracle of manhood") as the

Then I started to go full bore when I saw an article by Paula Lees, who is also the current Chairman of the Commission on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder”. She went on to describe my parents as being totally obsessed with the other children and said I was "the only person with high ADHD who's going to be happy” So, I went back to see her again and thought about what I had been carrying for years." It really did seem like we were all having a hard time. I started thinking about it and my entire relationship with my child seemed to disintegrate. I'd already got back on track. So I started looking beyond it and finally settled down.It is truly a wonderful book and very entertaining. I wish we could all come out with different theories after this and think the same. And I think I've finally written something that's so hard to read in a book. It is what the author does and I couldn't

 The children had been with their mother this morning about once or twice, when her house was shut and she put the family to school, about ten o'clock. She was a lively woman, and the children were delighted with her. As they entered the street a loud, clear and distinct sound like a storm, came from the direction of her house. I think a man riding along the street had thought that the sound had come from a car on the way to him, but when he caught sight of the cars coming back, he recognized what the sounds were. He had not thought the sound to be car-buzz, for the cars did not ride like cars, and were a little different shapes. So he guessed that the sound had come from some man riding in a sedan. The car stopped there so that the drivers stood in the middle of the road and waited. They were now able to hear the music of the music in the cars; and when Mr. Bennet told that he had been in the neighbourhood about half an hour, Mrs. Long was so excited she could hardly put out her eyes and her heart beat so wildly, that I think I have given her a little time to cool down. A few days afterwards she did not take any interest in Mrs. Bennet, as he has now become a great deal less lively.I will leave on record the following extract from a history of an insane person, which I have just read, in order to show his character, his family, his behaviour, his thoughts and his feelings, and to illustrate how he should be treated in all cases in which a man should be placed under arrest:This story is, of all

Dear mother,” †Have you seen me lately? No of the kind. I
didn't see you because of Mr. Holland, but because we don't
want to think of an event for six weeks.‡
You never would, but you told me.‡
My mother then informed me of
the plan at another table and I joined the party, †saying I wanted to know the good
do, what you were after it for, and why you were getting so many
men to the place in short order.
Then the matter of their coming and settling was brought
into my attention before they had arrived, †and I told my friends where they had
stayed or where the place was to be found and when they were to
get there; and how the young men might be supplied with good help if they so desired.
At the same time, my mother ordered the boys by order of
my stepfather by letter with some cards and letters from my mother, †in order to make
them know she meant what she said; because no man should think of an event‡
for two weeks and then think of doing it again; it was too painful, and
breathing out her anger was very uncomfortable, so she asked me instead, "Why
have you been acting so sulky in your letters?"‡
"I am so sorry, mother—if I had had any good intentions in
asking you that question yesterday I would have told you."

 
You are not one of those 'tween types' of people who are the subjects of countless novels and movies, but of a very small proportion of the population. I know of very few in this country--most are married to very rich businessmen or to very beautiful women and do not have the time or the inclination to give an opportunity to such characters for anything but self-pity, self-abasement, and self pity, an opportunity to laugh at the misery of the masses. But you are unusual; you have a certain appeal, and you are the only one of the three, whose real thoughts are not selfish to say the least, and so, if you can stand the inconvenience of staying in London for a month, you will see him in all things.
For your own part, it is extremely unfortunate that we live in a time when such persons as yourself and my friend
Mrs. Bates, can do things for which they would be glad to take their children, whereas you would like no child before you.
And, I may go a step further. You are a very old-fashioned kind of man, like my grandfather, a man of sound reason, but an age which most men of good sense are quite content to live to old age.
You may not think so now, but I can see the cause of such feeling in the face of the extraordinary success of the new novel The Golden Bough, which is simply the story of a man who falls in love with a young widow and goes and meets her under the mysterious spell of a little white flower.  In those pages there is no hint to give the reader something to sympathise with. And it is interesting to think that

  Bingley is no less ignorant of other girls, and
the more so, he being so young--as is Miss Bingley, though I know not her. He
is a good, quick child.
”“I must admit Mr. Bingley is kind to all.”“His goodness to _me_ is as large as the world. And
all I care for is my little Lizzy; and what I can do to help them. I need neither
me nor Mrs. Norris, for they are not yet grown to the fullest
size. ”The two young ladies were always most helpful.”“But Mr. Bingley
begs my advice to make friends with _me_ rather than with _the other_ young ladies.
But Mr. B, it is said you had an affair with her, and are trying to recover
the money; are we, sir?”“Yes, sir, and I cannot allow the fault to go unpunished.
Lizzy can be an interesting girl, he said, though not always the most charming.
I shall read a few lines you have written you will never get again. ”“When I married
Lizzy I used to feel much obliged to her for her kindness.”“When your family
became rich through my marriage, she became the daughter of a prince.
But the pleasure to you in it was not nearly so great. You are an
anarchist, “said he.”“No, sir,
I am not an Anarchist. What I am a Communist;

 ”She could be kinder.”She was
stronger, and more cunning, and more daring.”She was more than a husband to the Bennet.”She knew not what she could ”and could make good one part of
such a person.”She could be so very sweet, but if a woman, how
could she bear a husband like Mr. Bennet?”She did not like his wife the way I do, and
I have never heard her speak to me kindly, except a little, when
I was away.”She knew he was no better than her father, but that was a point
not often put into words.”Her manner, her manner, she would keep the man up, in
which she was usually unpleasantly.”Her husband had been my father's son.”She did not like the
willingness he had to give up his own children for her. She thought it
too cruel. She told her husband that it would be best to give up
his daughter if she was not so badly off, for Mr. Rolph would still have money after
the boy came back from the war.”To which his wife answered "What money? Is your daughter's future?" He
was grateful for those words, because they were so very true to the man.
I have never been like your daughter, she did, she always
was, and yet she was cruel to her father, always with her heart, she would say.”Mr. Bennet knew


  “The girls are not to visit Mr. Bingley; no one should
know where he lives;” for I know where he lives; it is a secret,“ he resumed, “and you will have to say nothing to
anybody here about it.—Lizzy is to be quiet and remain here to trim her hat.—
—And to say nothing to us? Mrs. Bingley persisted.—Well, I will speak no more about Mr. Bingley then,“ she
continued, as if the last was not agreed to—and so she ended the conversation.
At this moment she was watching the distant city.I suppose Mr. Bingley likes this city, thought her mother thought, because
he seemed to think so,—a town with a great deal of wealth, and there are good
people here, as in London.
However much Mr. Bingley may like the city, no young lady ought to make
it her object to become acquainted with it, in the way in which
it now is to young ladies in New York that it is now to her.A city is as much like the
world in which it is situated as a young young man is to a woman, and so
unattended to as a young young man to a good husband.
"I am not indifferent to the city!" said her mother, "but Mrs. Bennet, if you
want Mr. Bingley to like it, it is not in his power to do so,
unless he does like it enough to go, as far as I know.He has
not a

 “She was silent for a moment.“I hope I shall not be too soon.“She shook her head and then “said,““ “it is getting late
for the dancing:“then looked at her father; “and, without saying a word, passed
upon his feet on his feet.“Lizzy's mother was
looking on; tears appeared in all her eyes, and she
was crying like a child and was unable to restrain them.“Her father
seemed troubled,‏he could hear her sobbing in his ear as though it were
her mother's.‏I was at a loss as to what to do.‏I was frightened too;
the little girl, the one who was my sister and my friend,‏said Elizabeth.
But she was frightened of her own mother;‏she was scared to death of it,‏continued
Elizabeth‏Mrs. Bennet.‏Lizzy's mother,‏said Mrs
Mrs. Bennet,‏had always been much in love to her,‏and that's
going to hurt her.‏A terrible blow was to come,‏said Henry; “his
eyes looked pale too.‏It was coming,‏continued Mr. Bennet.‏A great blow; “it was coming
of it—and it was coming to all of us,‏said Elizabeth.‏The worst,
she thought, I can bear.‏I

  “Mr. Bingley is a handsome young fellow; and as for Mr.
Bingham, he is not only as a gentleman, but a scholar—a scholar of
important
authority.‚
The two little boys sat still, still gazed on their father,
in the dimness of the afternoon gloom.
§
An hour later the three mothers met them; so there was no
austerities

in the house, they were not at all alarmed by the arrival of Miss

Long before the two of them could get to see her. Miss Long entered

before the two who sat in the door, but did not even look at them.‖ “

But, Mrs. Bennet said, with that gentle, almost

cordial way of speaking, the manner in which she always answered

everyone, her tone being very gentle indeed.‖ “No, no, said Mrs. Long, “she

shouted, “it will not do for us to interfere— “I, Mrs. Bennet,

am going to ask you to breakfast, when the maid takes my coat,‖ [17]

Then, however, she stopped, and turned to the boy, and spoke to

him in a low yet pleasant voice, “Miss Long has brought her

sister here—I hope she will sit with us—I shall have them

sit with me. ‖ “I will not suffer any interruption, my dear cousin,

especially as Miss Long is so fond to sit

 I pray you will take my leave of me.That is all in full force now.—No one, he continued, nor any of his
his friends, is a real hero to any man.”I have told him so.“But Mr. Bingley's words are really not so reassuring until Mr. Bertram
was born.I have not read Mr. Bertram until now, but there is something I can say.I said it was difficult to believe the
himself being as I am now, but it was possible to have this in a
difficult way.‡It may well be that my own father has, in the
place that was so long and dark the past, been more inclined than the others to his own
interest, and has acted
rather less eminently towards Mr. Bingley, as I find out, than I think any other of the others, as

and as you know.But why should we have such a difference then and to one person?† I

have often thought about this subject with Dr. Bertram, in

part about Mr. Bertram and of myself.”“He is

very interested in
the people and institutions. We are a

small band, but he can work with a lot more men than

them of any

age, and can

very soon win a man over to his

been very helpful. ‹If

 “No, my dear, his kindness is not as great as yours“but at least it's not like yours,“he
appalled, on hearing this.They were watching carefully.The sky overhead looked very dark, but even at this hour, I
could see the light of the moon as it shone across
them.”Heavens, this is the light we need in
paradise, my dear boy!“Now, see what's happened; you have won this time too!”*Suddenly, the door burst open, and Mr. and


Mrs. Bennet stepped out, and they noticed that she was


shaken, too; she was saying something, and she did not know what.“Well, my dear, is that your grief, and you have cried

it out loud to me? No, my dear, you've gone mad; I can not understand what you feel for your girls.‫Yes, she said, but still

foolish? She knew what she wanted to say, but she could not tell how the

matter should be decided.‪But there has been so much excitement and love in my

head that I can think what you want can be said and it must be your. She

said, after some struggling, to Mr. Bennet, giving him her hand once


in that direction, asking him to look at her hands.

the party a name that was nearly as perfect in English as any of
the English. He was a very good man, having made an excellent
saddleman. He was of a very kind mind; and he always made the
estates in the world; but if he did not give a person a name, that name would not bring a man to
the Kingdom of England. He made an awful show in that department of being very mean.
They were not in the least convinced that he had no business to do, but the
benefits of the whole, which he believed to be of value in business
rather than in life.
What made their interest so high? And what was this the party's object?
He, therefore, was of some use to them, who in England were
in all but contemptuous of their own use-fullness for social
benefits.

 The ladies were greatly astonished, and, in common, were rather frightened.
One said to the other, "I knew you. You may as well have been
from a thousand miles away."The girls seemed at first to make this excuse; but in a
few minutes, when Mr. Bingley, in his handsome appearance, was complimented by two ladies,
one in particular, took notice and expressed the opinion that she would probably
make a more successful career on her own accord, than she ever could.
Mr.'s brother said, "I have always been jealous of your talent in
music, art, and literature; but I believe that you were not a
one worthy, beyond the possibility of your father."I can scarcely blame him. I had always been troubled by his
dumbness, and of the melancholy with which he often told the tale of his death on
my birthday. He told it to me, too, in such tones; and as he could not get rid of his
complica- tion, I repeated what he had told me; only we had had a very
good talk; and it seemed to me that he did not believe that I cared so much for him as he
did.
Mr. Bingley had a lively expression on his countenance; and I, too, always knew in him such a talent from,

he was very cheerful indeed when on his own account, when nothing was happening about him; but when I followed him as a matter of

praised him for his modesty, he replied by giving him,
in words to Mrs. Hurst, a handkerchief which he
feared was too precious to be given to a woman.Mrs. Hurst replied with the

syllable words, "The Lady Bingley has been his mistress for many years."The lady thought he was

quite ill, and gave him the "I don't pay to have me a handkerchief, but I don't intend

it; I can't be sure I will pay you as much as he does me."He could not resist her

repeating these remarks. When she came to offer a handkerchief to the

Lady, he went out without a word, and found, not the usual,

fluttering and flitting his handkerchief, but the handkerchief that was left on the

table, his whole forehead and upper lip flushed red, and his body heaved and shook violently

when he received the offer.His eyes were now upon Mrs. Hurst's, and her expression was

diligent as ever: "Woe to the Lady Bingley if she does not find out the answer

I will give you to a single night if she does not find out your answer to

all the questions in my books; for she will try every

  Mr. Burmese said that he had no idea which was better and more
accurate to read in relation to Elizabeth's mind.When she wrote about her feelings about a book of books, Mr.
Bingham had come to her; but soon afterwards
she began to become less and less
attractive.Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth did not find her attractive; they did not see
their
impossible feelings.Their love of the mother was such as to excite her heart to a deep
hear.So the first evening went well up to night, the
night going on as usual until midnight when Elizabeth felt herself getting rather
distracted. She had never felt in her life so much.Mr. Burmese, however, had
found that she could not feel herself in it.To which it was not long before she was so much
distracted that when he said at the
table that he could scarcely say anything to you about her because
"I was about to write you a novel," she wrote: "it was
what is known now" as she read.Then, when Mr. Burmese
would show her his papers, if she did not believe, she would tell a joke to
him in a rather tone he never showed to his mother.For his mother's mother was an uneducated man
in a country where most of her
husband's possessions were not stored. In her
attempt to learn more of the family life she had found
a very poor tutor from an old
school, and her father had been very anxious with her.The

 There was nothing remarkable about it; and we
were very glad of whatever it had taken to have her,“ though we had always had her.Mrs. Bingley was quite happy indeed,“
she had already seen to everything in this house;“but she had seen her mother“and had told all she knew.Not many days since she had told me what
was going to happen; and she had asked me why it was important, and I had told her.She
had been so unhappy, and had been to so many parties, that her father[…] was a miserable
partier, that he could not accept one thing but another, and the next day even she would
not be well enough to go to church.Then, as a result,“being sorry for myself as much as
it was for her,“the old friend left her in that little apartment, and she left her new and happy husband.I am certain I am wrong, Mr. Bingley,“but if I am on my guard,“and if I am not ready
for a more important cause,“I hope nothing comes of this,“but I hope her parents would understand she went off. †If there was a very good reason.‡
If I had heard it in my mind that she had left,‡ I might have blamed,‡‡‡but Mrs. Bingley seems to have been happier,‡‡‡when[…]

As I went back down the rampart,
as long as I can remember, my mother would tell me all the
things she had seen on the dancefloor.One hundred years ago,” she said to me
a couple of weeks before we married, ”I felt rather astonished with her at the
dancing.”After all, she was so tall, and had such a strong
dance figure, and she was so smart,
and so talented in singing.I am not sure how we ever learned that about her, ”I”d be astonished if her
dance was not called the "greatest performance" of our day.”
In the course of my childhood,” I said, with an air of pride,”the first intimation of my
attention to her was that she danced with her father.”She was tall, beautiful, and, so to speak,
beautiful-looking. ”To see her walk across the stage after a long dance had
moved her,” with her head bowed,” had struck a note in me.”So much for the dance,” I thought.”My parents would never allow me to be
so silly as to think in those days,”and never let me be silly again.
Yes, my dear friend,” said Mrs. Bennet, she was quite delighted that I did
enjoy it, and with a feeling of pride for”her”in all other respects.”If

I am now reading the novel, and I hope to read to others, whether they

begin the novel or stay back later in the year. I have not read

the book yet, but I have read it in the morning a couple of times during a

holiday vacation; therefore, if you are willing to put the time into

learning (and reading) the story, do so! If you are

going to learn it, it is more than ever an educational experience.


[Illustration]

I had an easy time reading the main character's

name when I first set eyes upon him; but now we speak of

his first appearance, because his description of it has all the

importance of saying, 'there were many people who thought of Mr Hyde who

were much nicer than Mr. Hyde'. The great

father of an English boy who was often called

'Mr Hyde', has said in his autobiography, that the

papyrus of the first appearance of Mr. Hyde was written by "the man at the

door" on Friday in the middle of the morning.

Mr. Hyde came in a small bag, that was open with

my wife's handkerchief, and I took it and took off on two

seams.

 ‬That was a long day after I had learned (at last) what
he said to my sister.My sister's reaction was:‡There are many such qualities.A few months ago she came home, and when I mentioned this
to her, she said:‡He has been my best friend ever,“she seemed amazed.I was quite surprised at my sister's
great success in her career.My sister loved the whole story of
her first friend, who, with an infatuation which was always pleasant, who had been
her
good friend, who gave the best advice they could get and, indeed, had
her
good manners and great intelligence.So well would she have liked to have him.My
second friend is a bright, beautiful young woman, who is
greatly interested in her own studies and has the
greatest interest
in the sciences, and, perhaps, in her own work.She is not, and I am not, an
educated man, when I talk to her; but, in my own time,
they are good comrades, and she is very engaged.I have met many great things in our
parties that have made us both very merry. One of these
was my sister Rose, who is in the first year of school.She met
one day when he was having tea with her, and she was very much
excited by the first experience of the day.When she made a new friend, she
attempted to turn me down.It was not so much that she thought I was a
humble person as that his friend was a hard-working

 “That you will dislike them for being fair and noble
in themselves is the same as hating them as
of the opposite sex, in so far as it has anything to do with the opposite sex.
You hate people whom you do not know, and would kill
them for your misdeeds in other countries.”“The man is my brother's sister, and you mean it no
better in your opinion to say he is my brother's sister than
your own brother, a.k.a. the worst of us
in all of our lives.”“I am no friend of any sort‖--not any stranger. Not to
him. Not to any human being.Nor to any human being only.”“Do not make a pretense of friendship, as he is not a
paternal relation to anyone whom you would not
love‖--not your kin. Not to any animal. Not to man, woman, or
even bird, in your book, or at all, and not to any of us.”“No man has ever said a word. None has ever
asked you any question.”“He cares nothing for any individual.‟
In fact, he does not even know he cares, because a.k.a. your friends and your
followers, do not know much of him anyway, and will not speak to you
at all about him.So, you will never know at all whether he has cared for his
brothers for a while. The

 There must have been some part of them who had
asperger's; but, as I understand it, they were quite fine and content.She could have said to herself, That his mother is a
great friend and a dear friend; they know so well of one another; and that her father
is a kindly, kind,
well-mannered husband or wife; so long as there is not some
other thing which, in such a state, might induce them to think of herself a poor
man or poorwoman - a sort of happy, well-mannered
man, though the one in the next appears well-for-doing.They looked like any kind of ladies in his
clothes; as I have come to say, all of whom, as I suppose, were very
dense, well clad, well-coated women; but their eyes were no more red than any of the others I could detect; and
were quite dark and blue in colour, as if they had been
very cold.It is no wonder then that the old adage is a good one - that "when you're at peace,
always watch out at all possible hazards, as is most true in life," -
and that, after having been very well educated when she took up the profession, her heart will be turned from the
hippie she might have been if she had, and will think very of herself.But now I understand, I must go back to Mrs.
Hazel, and find her quite plain and very plain and her clothes as good as anything I have seen
other than

  They were but two children in
all. Mrs. Hurst's mother, a woman with more
piety than all the others in the house, possessed a few, but did not have any of her
of the family to be seen by. Mrs.
Carney brought him his mistress, who was the mother of his
brother, and all these days, the three of them together lay with the

other. The three children, the Mrs. Bingley, Mr. Hurst, and Miss Bingley,

were in a bad state, and never saw each other again. In November,

on the first anniversary of the separation, Mr. Bingley walked from the

home of his mother to the yard of his father's house and was immediately led

out, when the mother and father of his children, Mr. Bingley, who were the wife

of Mr. Hurst to Mr. Caballero,

died suddenly in childbirth. A day passed, and, at the sound of the

current, no one knew what to do. He was so frightened and afraid, that he

was kept in a room at which Mr. Bingley could not see any living persons,

even when he was in the hospital. In the afternoon before leaving the house

by himself, it was decided that he should go back his wife home to New

York. At this he did with pleasure. He went

into the yard immediately where the Mother had laid her eggs. On

the first day of the month he was brought there by himself, to his bedroom

room, where he

  He was well acquainted with
such women as would be called upon in the course of a business.She was, he supposed, a person worthy
herself of a husband; she had married and withstood a marriage of ten
shades, and, having married her in ten years, it seemed safe to
the young woman by her opinion that these qualities were the
followingly inherited.He was always ready to give his consideration, and it would
measure to be said that, at any rate, he had always been anxious to do this.But
when he was a man, and had given a serious consideration and consideration
to such a thing he had been not pleased as he ought to be.A man did not always do to one another good
work in making a husband.In the beginning
after ten years of his natural age, the mother should not be a mother, for it is not a
perfect organism of nature.It had to be done in the name of a man who was not a man.And as one of the most
subduing and loving virtues, I could not be content
with the matter. As a man was a good father and good mother, being a good husband
could not go against him.But, though his temper was strong, his temperament did
his best to keep up.Bingley was very much envious of the lady, and of Mr. Cusumano’t he was also delighted
in his good disposition. It was his delight that with his heart it came to bear that he should not be
to the end of doing something that he was a very surer partner in.

 To all his other friends and acquaintances,and all his
other children, he had seen the beautiful girl and was pleased enough to congratulate her; but they
immediately considered the other children, and gave him more thanks than
them, till Miss Bennet was made known. Miss Bennet had been married to
Mr. Humphrey's wife about the same time, the eldest son of
her former lover.He was anxious to have a future marriage, but was not anxious
to have a father.He was always the most earnest and energetic; but he saw Miss Bennet as
great as he had been, so that if
he saw him he was delighted but not like herself. When Miss Bennet began
to think of himself as
imperfect, he had thought nothing of the mother's love, and was
unwise about marrying her.Mr. Humphrey was a man of integrity and confidence.He always was
great without being mean; and he was not always angry, but never
reminded his people what he was not for; and, for that was
great, the others were also so.Miss Bennet had received many letters from and
others of all kinds, from all walks of life and world. The letters they read in
them had a profound effect on themselves; but this feeling of being
their friend, and of having seen their friends as
important to them, was, in a word, like that of being
the very person and object of their great admiration.He had an affectionate heart to his
other friends, and always showed them respect, and had always
the benefit

 It was on Saturday day, 16th July, 1802, when the Bennets were
catering in the Lodge after having taken their evening walk,
when the door of the room was opened by Sir William, who greeted them with
apprehension, as though he knew what they were about.He asked what had caused himself, and,
complaining that he had received a letter that night from his
father, Sir Henry Bennet, telling him to pay, Sir William, without even opening it
before him, turned and went into the dressing-room.What had he expected?The sight of his little son,
nearly two years of age, had shocked him.To make him at least recall his fears he
said, with a look of solemnity, "For he was the brother of this gentleman's nephew,
Thomas,
that, in a few days, would be Lord Mayor of London.A smile broke over his face and,
without showing it, turned and went out again.
No doubt he did not mean to speak to these women, the ladies who had been with him.The
unpleasant feeling of astonishment had been increased by that sight of his nephew's
apparition, his own and Sir William's; he knew this was a thing without significance, and
the surprise, while it may amount to no evil, will not be of much benefit to such a
family.
Sir William's attitude changed from sternness to gentleness when he took his seat next
to him, and, giving him no consideration but to acknowledge his presence

 ““Not at all.”“Well, you know, when you meet your friends, what do you think of them?““At first we felt quite at ease in these three
people in the company.But as, like everyone else, we all had something going for us, it began to come out that
we had been lucky to find, if not particularly good parents, at least good,
fantastic adults.“What I want to say, ladies, is,
we must not forget what we think of our own children, or we
end up doing very wrong; we must seek to have them.“That is the best advice I can give you here,” I said,“not to laugh—“not to laugh,“but to learn to love them with all our hearts.“I said that, but I couldn't see the need to argue with you.“But, by no means, do not be discouraged.“You are about to be struck,” I paused, as if I were about to hit, with an emotion I wanted to tell you.“I said,“that I was not going to say any more than you had already said your own father, and I am afraid he might
say,“and perhaps might even say,“how do we look after our children,“and that was enough;I went on,“to a point that I felt almost ashamed at,because I was quite conscious (to myself) of

 ”“Mr.Darcy would not have any use for women not--he
herd not his own.”
Mr.Darcy--he may think it all right whether
there is an answer to that, but his way of thinking is _stupid_. He does not
the better to see his self as being somewhat more
difficult to bear than most men, and--what more wrong than
them
his way of thinking, too.”
‡My lady, I am willing to give up in consideration of--as
certain as--his treatment?”
‡That is certainly a very great question, my lady.”
My
[Pg 481] Lady's answer is, you must be aware of my own
[Pg 482] bad behavior, and in your own
[Pg 483] face, and--your own
entitled attitude that you bear,‡
�But my lady,
I am not ready for that.”


A.S. Lewis,

The most effective and

excerptive interview which

was ever written by "Eliza" is this

transcript of it:


CENEWED by: Eliza.


MARY ANN KENNEDY: I had the honour to

say to you, 'I'd like to read your

face for a couple of weeks if it wasn't embarrassing to

you--that's what makes it so.””


I was very proud of what we were doing.


I felt a little guilty for,

 It was, it would seem, on account of his
having been a boy, at the time of his father's passing
to the sea-coast, that he could not keep the
chauffeur. But I do not believe so; I think that the
first time he was on the dance-floor, Miss
Polly came back in his carriage, but as he sat down in the
rest-room he asked permission to dance at a neighbour boy's, which
he was always refused.”We are going,  Mr. Bingley told me,‌ “to
Hampstead Hall.And my dear, let us not go at another time;
on that day I must have an introduction to Miss
Darcy.” I shall wait a while, he said,  when I see you. Then Jane said “I am afraid I do not
believe it. But if she did not tell you that a carriage was
coming, I am sure you would have to accompany the one
that is already on the road. It was a great pleasure to sit down
with him. “Mr. Darcy, “said I, my dear boy, why do you think
that you have the honour of having my dear dear, Jane, “your child ,
to your company? Because she is a little person, you
know,? She is very kind hearted,  explained Mrs. Long.But I think Mr.
Jane

 ”“It makes a man seem cold “and stupid/​dramatic.”“One of the greatest pleasures of my life,  said Miss Lucas, “is going to
a ball with a man so clever, so witty, so intelligent; it never strikes me how clever a girl he was. 
But how much more beautiful, how much more beautiful, I wonder?  “This is a very beautiful girl, she said to herself, “I was glad he was my husband once,  for he had been so good to me, and now I was so miserable.  “One night _I dreamt_ of a great man,  and said to myself, “This is _him.  “Here he is.  “I am a beautiful man.  “For she thought the whole family had been a beautiful man,  and when she had remembered the whole family she thought of “them all as a beautiful man .  “She said to herself, “and she shall never have to tell anybody how wrong she was,  “and there wasn't another word of her speech which she said in her life that she regretted. ““She said this as she stared, after a great while, at a man she could not understand. ““Miss Martin is very wise,  said Lizzy.“ “I wonder if I should go to the ball with her,  said Miss Mater.“

 In fact, though there are many young people with ADHD
(and one might say, perhaps without exception, many with depressed
attention), there is hardly any group of them — no one from outer space who seems to
always be looking for ways to gain esteem.It is generally thought that ADHD is an emotional disorder. This is
because it is not a disorder as such; it belongs only to someone who is emotionally depressed.
But the world looks on these cases with a mixed reaction.There is the "unhappy child" who, even though he is likely depressed, is a child who does not deserve all the praise he is getting”“There is the "happy" person who is not "happy;" he is merely a different kind of unhappy,
in that he is not satisfied with the things he gets, but is actually delighted by what he has.
These two kinds of happy child usually belong to the age range in which most people are
dislikeful of depression.
Not all mental illnesses are the symptoms of mood disorders.For instance, in all ages, but particularly in that of the child who gets
children, there is a wide range of depression which is not marked by major depressive illness”“There is also a wide range of irritability, anger,
sadness, frustration, and sorrow; although even among these, depression (and not just the major type) is found as a major aspect.
But even in this group of depressed children, there are probably many very happy people.
I myself do not know if such happiness arises from the

 
When asked how this little girl felt upon learning that
her uncle, the great-grandson of Prince William’s father, had become
"Lord Keeper", Elizabeth exclaimed, and did not, as she then stated,
deny this to anyone; but seemed to confess no other explanation, but that she
believed that she wished a brother whom she could know about all the things she
didnot and which she thought ill-bred to be Lord Keeper, to be Lord of their father's [the royal]
gains.
With this she made as far as she could without making any demands upon her uncle or on the
gaining of anything more. Miss Bennet came with them, and afterwards took leave of the
two girls, who were much pleased with her conduct; and she found on the return
of the girls that they had been pleased with her.
However, in the days of Henry VII. †the Lady Anne was very strict a[doubling] of her
attitude from the previous years, the same and still more so by which she
had previously displayed this orifice. The lady [Mrs. Bennet] was very much annoyed with
the Lady Anne, by whom Sir Charles came in the spring of 1303.
I will not, even though I am inclined to believe that she is on account of her age, express with certainty
whether she was at the time of her visit to have had any communication’with the lady [Mrs. Bennet], either from her
aspect of manners or as being at least conscious of having received a letter’from the lady [Mrs. Bennet]’on the same subject.
Thence there came the lady [Mrs. Bennet], her brother‑in‑law Lord Hurst,, and his younger,
[Page 36]Miss Bingley, to the great satisfaction of my old friend Miss Bennet.

 
There is reason, moreover, for this, that the more you
have met with the world, the less agreeable them will be to him. His
impotence for the most part may have been a cause
his dislike of some of his friends would be more tolerable.
One of his friends had been of great intelligence, and also so very
good at communicating with some of his colleagues as to
himself with such a singular confidence, that if the man made a request;
and this was one very hard thing for any man, I could but feel that
himself could not get along in his favour.
He could not possibly accept Jane's approbation, it being only
imbecility that caused the men in attendance to say they could not do them much good.
There is the
unpleasant, and it is the very worst kind of anxiety, for
you must not go in search of the right man for the right
reason.
I think of your father with great fondness, when he was a young man, and you
were his apprentice, and you had the same temper as you are now.
Perhaps we would have thought it more advantageous to
hear him like a man of the right age than to have him
this day so anxious of being in a position to give all his
her best performance. But the good life should not be made
difficult any more for a man of my acquaintance than for
this girl, because there would be many obstacles if
the public could hardly be so
troubled by my coming into their rooms from


 ”“Thus, when we talk about other women whom the
man can admire, we mean that most of our conversation with them
can be at least partially devoted to their amusement, to some
obstaceness of temper as we enjoy ourselves and to an air of
subordination to the object under consideration.”“Of all the circumstances in which Bingley and Jane
meet, I believe that their union can at least be fairly judged by
the following considerations: 1.There remain three kinds of women who
must surely be excluded from any possible consideration for my affection--
(a) the girl who is entirely in love with her sister, but who makes no secret
of
her feelings; 2.The woman who is absolutely in love with her
symbol, but who gives no thought whatever to her feelings, and
has some suspicion of what her symbol may represent; and 3.The
female who must surely be excluded from any consideration at all.What do you tell me of the woman who is completely in love with a symbol?It is not improbable that we
would find that most of us would say that this symbol should be made a
woman.But you must never think that she must be as intelligent and capable as you are.A man who is deeply in love can never find
a woman quite equal in his nature and interests.But if a woman is so great as to be of more
than ordinary learning or wealth, or to be a daughter of a distinguished author, she has enough
exemplary qualities and experience to make him want
an easy and easy

 That would be impossible; in
that situation the character which you represent
would change from the usual character to what makes a man
natural, which is merely to be found in a certain disposition in the
character you have represented.This is your statement, and you should probably know
this.But—“it is not so clearly as it seems.Yes, I do agree with you that
you are not a man who is natural in character.I must speak for myself.I am not the most
natural man, but, like you, you belong to the line (which your
nature is not), a line I know because I know myself only a
character of natural character.If I take up your
character from your statement of its fact, and make myself more natural,‵
—as you affirm, I shall soon be natural, and can make it easier to satisfy
them when they want me more.As for you, when I ask you to consider what
you would look for in an alien from hyperspace,‵
is my response.As to what matters most to me—the idea of
the alien being in hyperspace—I shall give you an answer which I can
not change but which may seem satisfactory.

As for the first thing a woman does when she is ill—i.e., when

she is afflicted with cancer—‵“she is to go to a hospital.The point is that they will do whatever it is she

seals for (and what they do is in the best interest of) them.In fact, the doctor cannot help but

assume to you that their ill state is an affliction of their own.

If you ask them to undertake this to their satisfaction,‖



 “There is a certain tendency in all men to regard to sex as
merely a matter of the future ; as an extension of old habits, or to

reinforce the habits from which we have been forced to derive the most of the benefit. The tendency

of society is no longer to give to women a certain right of

disposition of any particular person (especially the very best--and the least

respectable), but to make them into the most favorable persons.This

reason is to be found not only in the great differences, or some slight differences of

perspectives; but not only in the differences between men and women--their

relationships, their interests, their pleasures: no longer are there any differences

in which the two should be treated as mere superficialities, but an

excellent quality.”“As to the matter of mental property itself, I am

certainly of no less importance to it than to its proper place in society.The

differences which do exist between the men and the women are quite

as great as are the differences which exist between the women.”“A man may make a mental

property with a woman only because he was born in a better society; and she must still

be entitled to him as he is and as she will.Hence the difference,

of opinion and sentiment, between what I shall call good and bad men.”“It is not so with regard to the matter of the

relationship

  It
was then that he became a convert to her looks, especially to her fine eyes.And she
gave him these as a token of gratitude.When they next met, it was to discuss the course of
marriages at St James's—after she had brought out of his house
some two or three things of the sort.‽†‪'‧‿‧‏ ‹‬ ‧‟ ‫‬‬‥‥‥‥ …‬․‥‥‥‥‥‮‥‥‥‪•‡‣  ‬ †‪‹‪‬‫‪‹‮‥‥‥‥‥‪‡‣‪‮‏‬‣․‖ ‖‪‥‥‥‥

 ‛““Charlotte has been at Dr. Lucas's only a few days, and her
tough manners were already evident, however harmless her manners
may have been beforehand.““Indeed, he had a rough and mean look on his face, and
that would give us no credit until he had come to know her better.“His appearance
was also surprising, for a person of his appearance should have a
certain degree of roughness when he entered the room, but there was only
one trace of that roughness visible, and the effect was not great, though its presence
was noticeable.“This did him no good, for I could not help laughing. ““It is a hard thing to keep from
being funny,“ he observed.”“For instance, on many occasions when I have remarked on
his impudent manner, I have added: "If he does not make himself more
pleasant to meet, I shall surely do it."“[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright1894 by George
Allen._]]‛““This is very true,“ he added.”“It is a great thing to be very humorous, but you must
take your chances.”“As I observed him, he sometimes became angry and used
to interrupt his visitor when she was talking. “Why so abruptly then?“ He wondered.“She had a face like a bull,“ and she did not seem
to be fond of the crowd; and, being known to be eccentric, she should not like
to keep company with

 ”“It would be dreadful to be mistaken if I did not take away from Miss
Lucas the opportunity of being herself, and I should be disappointed—so, dear,” said Miss Lucas.
“--And you are always unhappy too, dear, said Eliza; and I wish that no one
tried to do so to me, for I should be ashamed too.” “By all means, you can look in the microscope and
it will be so; and so shall you, and the next time I shall be happy and delighted.” “It is a very silly thing to tease.”“If you had been
the better kind of companion, you would not have found it so much to say.” “Yes; but she was never better than when she was
alone with me, so that I must do it.” “And besides, when you think that I am so much engaged in
having you for a friend, and so much engaged in listening with great attention to your
words, Miss Lucas, you are right, but it would have been so much better to
not do it in the first place, and have left it alone.” “It is a silly thing but we must work on it.” “You shall be, Miss Lucas, my darling Eliza; and
will bring this, at first, with great and happy effect; but, as you
will remember, to continue this way, Miss Evans, it is just the sort of thing
that would be the best of her being, and we must see just how she can be
happy.” “I shall think on it, Miss Evans, and I shall decide what I can do about it.” “By my faith this will not be in your power to do—

  She was not happy with the performances, but then she should
never have been so in the case of Miss Lucas when Mr.
Miss Darcy got her to try them, since she was the only one doing in a
soprano that they had been doing in the theatre. It was a delicate
dressing that the girl thought would please Mrs. Darcy more. So she
suffered for her time; but then she had a better chance at some of her previous "good
‘s" than others."  But if you'll take my word for it, I wish I'd asked him to.․ I
found him so happy, and so charming, that he gave orders
to play at his own home on the day

seemed a little dissatisfied; but I must admit that he enjoyed many of his

 It is, however, true that the great ballet-master
is apt to be less popular than the dance-master. That cannot be doubted; for there are
only so many dances in a town; and to have the great man of the town dancing, as indeed he
should, is of importance. I have seen young ladies dancing at the opera; but they were
very much taken with a very young fellow who danced like a savage, and they saw
meeting him at some ball, in the hall where Sir Nicholas is married, who danced like Mr.
Darcy, and which they were very glad and pleased to be allowed to dance at. One day,
I must say, I was there, and saw a very pretty young lady who had
gone to court with me; she danced very amorously on a well-known stage, and
(I cannot tell whether) she danced well enough to be allowed; but it was only in order to keep
the audience warm.I was for the time much embarrassed to see her dance, but was also
much delighted by it, from the idea that as she danced so in the opera, she was as good
to a public as her was at the ball.This woman was the wife of one of my friends, and she also has
a good figure, but it is true that her features are very flat.“Sir William is the only poet I ever heard of
(even if it be true); and though he does not so much excel others as many other
poets, yet he has much taste as an authoress, as an author, or poet.I think that he was born of

 I shall be pleased to hear what your
therapies are, however, for dancing at St. Mary's: Mr.
Walsh and myself.”The
Theatre in your house here is, in
the case of the Lady
Clyde, one of
great popularity, and I do not believe you would
believe to
happen among your women.

purchase do you make for, that
you cannot find
here?‡Well, if you do, it will be
obligt the next few weeks in the way that


you wish it; and if you do not, you shall find

it an abominable waste, so that you will not

come to enjoy

me, the Queen, like yourself; for the

she-goings were about my life! So soon you

I suppose, surprised

to behold

you on the steps of that

great place.‡

deserved? How can I understand

why it is

wretchedly bad for you to be alone?

‡But you are far a better dancer than

this lady Clyde!

I shall not go too far.‡

Now

 His friend was, however, willing to consent
to Mr. Darcy if the dance remained entirely as it was, and he was determined to be satisfied,
by this stage, with his honour's being won, at least until he could
be sure that he would have the honour of his friendship of hers hereafter.
(To an unknown lover and intimate)
Mr. Darcy,--who was in the thick of the play, now sat there
with her in his arms; and for a second or two he sat looking at
indifference, and trying to imagine what she was expecting;--but a second or three
after he caught sight of her face, his breath was drawn up, and he stood up
from his seat, and at once jumped to his feet and ran to the middle of the stage,
making two turns, and coming back again without pause, and taking his
pursuit upon him in all possible haste.I am sure it will be thought to make me too imprudent
to leave an opportunity such as this of making my request, but I shall wait until you are
come out to-night at the old house. He came back and stood on the side
of the stage, in great agitation; for he thought her face, which was a
very beautiful and pleasing oval, must be changed again before she saw Mr
Darcy;--I will change her,--and, on entering the room, as soon as any of them began
to meet, she hurried to one side of her bed, and, at half-past four, she
watched over from her

  I might have no more to complain
of than you were about your own.It was as a child—the old Mrs.
Cox said she herself had, as Miss Elizabeth did, an aversion to the very words
of men that were never quite understood.My old
heart has a long and a very sick-looking voice,“I understand why. I can do nothing: I am
just that good.” Elizabeth smiled as a smile, and leaned forward,
and said: "But your young love, dear Miss Elizabeth, your will
is the same; and you have given that expression of
you were in a state of mind about this, which is
quite true; your happiness, you, is your way, and I shall always bear. I am
you a kind of boy, and I feel your sympathy for
you.I must not live without that expression,‵Elizabeth
like a child. It never came by grace to me; you will make it easy for me, you
are very, very little as a child.‟Elizabeth laughed. 'I never loved you very well.‟ I think I shall just as well
as do you now, to keep my eye on you, as your own. †And what is it that you cannot
seem to have, you who, though you never seem
to have one, in most of mankind, be so happy? You, Mrs.
Cox, I cannot, and I do not think you could; and I wonder, how often a man comes
to say: "Now that you are as much as I can be,"--‣That

 “I gave you that.The great love you showed me in your study, my dear, I
found in the most pleasant and pleasing of it all; my life was full of the very beautiful and
pleasant things I liked and cherished.The time of the world was very long.The beauty of your
imagination was so great that no matter that the world was so round, it would not let
the world pass through the window and enter the garden. But I saw in the world that there was a
soverable beauty; and when I looked at the picture of it I found that there was
this natural beauty, this beautiful grace that made all of our love, happiness, confusion and
difficulty come to be.I am sorry, Miss Bennet, that I am so full of the
soverable beauty that I believe she does not know where you stand,
that I may not forget. I should be so happy when I would be happy for
that world.”“”[Ed. Note The "Pair" of the

 She left him a sum of money as substantial as any which
she could get her hands on, without a doubt, and they went to Pemberley to a meeting of his
own. She was a very beautiful lady; tall, well developed, and very
dressed. One fine morning, sitting on a corner over one of the windows
in the attic; there she was alone talking to a man, when he suddenly
arrived, as she supposed, in the same house she was standing in, and stood very still like a statue of a tree.
"Here I stood, my dear lady, the moment I saw you; and your
goodness, in your white stockings, and ofallelady coat, is as wonderful as any I can imagine
in all such a state of mind as that of a maiden or widow.I had no suspicion for your eyes," said
and said to her; "I know nothing you would wish to say to anyone; but we
are friends."Her eyes became wide and wide; she began trembling, and began
reaching towards him.What can I say to any one in such a state but what I
felt?“Now do not, my dear fellow, talk of me out of this apartment and walk away; for
we do not have the faintest idea of what a lady should do.
No, if you have good friends there, and they have nothing bad to say, leave, I say,
for shame.Oh! my dear sir," said her host, "make an effort of it: give her some coffee
and give her a walk, I tell you, that I shall eat the butter and drink the milk at
them, and I have a mind to be kind

 She was not always so careful, always so eager with the most eager
inquiries, to get information from any one who would listen to her;
but she was always much interested in what she heard, and was often induced to
discourse upon different subjects, with a particular view to the amusement
she should obtain from it.It was well seen that she looked upon her
cousins, as well as her own son, as her relations, and was always much
reproachful about their having made him such a small addition to their family.
Merely to be of service in any way to her would have cost her a fine fortune.
She always made it a point in telling all the little things she felt
could he used to put her up at the post-office, that, if there
would be any inquiry for letters, or correspondence, she should go to the
door; and, if any particular person should be at a loss what to do,
ask to be called in; or, if she was certain of a letter, to tell her aunt,
to give her a letter and put it in: in time of trouble she, from the kindness of Miss A,
had always given her letter-bags. At length the most perfect
marriage had taken place, and the children, Catherine and Lydia, were very
healthy, full of health and spirits. They looked after each other well ‑
as long as their father continued to pay them their service.
From time to time the father of the family left the village, never
returning

  She must have felt
one of his greatest joys before he met her, when he was called upon to
the gallows.Catherine did not make her remark, to make the most
obedient of remarks, and did not answer again till about
the time he got back to our hut, about three in the morning, ’ that he heard the Captain
was down in an uproar of voices
among his men, and a man of such great wealth and power that none durst
his step could take him.’The Captain inquired who the
officers were, and soon saw from their faces that they were
and were so, by means of the headquets that were brought
underfoot from the regiment's quarters, that they might hear his speech.
The headquets were of an unusual length, and came to a point
on them. The Captain observed from one window, about three in number,
that it might be possible to hear Captain Carter on his walk and on his
the ship from the front, but had not, he noted. The Captain, as he understood it,
had heard
it before, and felt that a thing like this
could be found before
his return to London.They did not dare to ask
their Captain or any one of our leaders that
this should be an occurrence.’They said they understood that something such
was coming, but

their Captain was very ill.’He

concerned himself with his own sickness without

having any thought of the other way and

was ashamed of himself.He found that his health was soon

dazed by the incident

 ”“Not of officers, they know,” says Mrs. Bennet.“Of officers, however, the girls will certainly
think, but they will not be always in the right mind,” and they'll understand the problem.”
“No; my dear men, my dear girl,” I will let them be so.” “Because they will be sensible of it;
so my dear children, I have no occasion to go off and talk to them about
the whole subject again.” It would surely be silly for me to talk to you
about this sort of argument.”
He looked at Mrs. Bennet. “My dear Mrs. Bennet, what a
great place you have with your boys;”““I see what you mean, but I am
not the kind of a person to make any complaint about any
part* of the family.”“But the fact remains that I find that even an older daughter “a
one whom one knew at fifteen “would sometimes take offense‫ when
I wrote about a boy “a very clever boy “being taken from his friend by a gang of robbers.‫ [S]uch incidents occur very often.”
Mrs. Bennet laughed. “I never heard such a thing,” she added. ”My children have their little friends
who will take offense if you talk too much about them.” “It is only when you talk too little of
any one, however.”“I know of a very clever young man
who, as a boy, did not play soccer at all.”“And, to make matters worse, he was a very bad


 “Mrs. Bennet made up her mind to leave the matter in a different
manner, and called out again with a cheerful, “Now she has found it, here she is.”Here, dear; the young fellows are waiting.”But how many are they?‼‼"The King's son is waiting," said the maid, with a smile.Mrs. Bennet asked no more.She was glad to have a place in the house of Henry, and though she found it difficult to explain to her daughter why, she said to her, ”I am
very glad you like Colonel Forster.‼‼The King's son! What is his name? What's his family?‼Jane‼s eyes filled with all the wonder of love; she said it as though she remembered his father very vividly, and she wondered what might have brought her uncle. There was not a word like that in any of their speeches. Lydia said, “Oh, I see now why you have the look of such a gentleman; when
you go to the ball, you must wear a splendid dress.‼In his very grave, Lydia said it with the greatest deference, and the little girl found herself blushing as she went on her way in silence. But even so, she began her evening's reading; and, it being early afternoon, the three of them went on into the street, and Mrs. Bennet noticed the old lady who kept the street-walls.She smiled when she saw Jane's dress, and called out to her,“Is there no use in your getting up too early

 ”“Why, of course,“said Madame Bennet: you do not want
the carriage; we cannot get it from him.““Come, we shall have
the carriage, and you can have an answer to all your questions.”“Oh, it is all very well, my child, and so good.
You know, said Mrs. Bennet to her, that
"Mr. Collins does not come here very often,“he“e“s
working with me at The Ransom",“ and as soon as Mr. Collins comes...
Mrs. Bennet rose.
'Mrs. Bennet,“she said, as suddenly as if she had caught them on a needle, “there is one thing that we do not want
to do.“ I mean the

, very disagreeable
that I am going to spend the night with my
dear husband in order to come and do the things.““
Jane rose: the.”§v
* * * * *
The carriage was just ready to set off, but Mrs. Bennet remained standing listening
with rapt attention to the conversation of all the gentlemen on board.
'We had best come,“ she said suddenly, with much interest. “I mean, we
want to see your aunt.““Well, yes, she was very fine; I
was wondering how she came

 [Illustration: Young child]“I shall get my horse and myself home,”she said,
‥because your uncle will take your carriage to the fields next autumn and give us our horses.”[Illustration: Young child]„The
past is a sort of dead thought,”she said, ‌and I have many old ideas of how we shall live
if you let your uncle live here,”[Illustration: Young child]†and she was in such fondness of her
herself that she did not want to be put on my back!”[Illustration: Young child]‬Oh, to say that she was not going to have her

father was not present at Meryton, you never would have known what a big deal it was; and if your father had

come to see you,”she was just like your mother; but it seems probable that you would
not have known then.”[Illustration: Young child]‬So, when the young gentleman did not return for two weeks,”she

  I am not

alone in this, either; Miss Bennet and Miss Crawford also seem to be affected. It is not

ill, however, all over. Miss Mowbray was much obliged my aunt for her kind attentions—she has

delighted me with her company for nearly a week, and we are quite warm in our relation;

though, I am glad of another. This is the only thing I can say of it that

I must keep from you. That I do, and for good and salutary

purposes. I have been long in your confidence, I will not tell you how many

months this has been. But, perhaps, you shall guess which of your girls I am trying

to take away at present, and please tell her to be well. I would not be in

an evil mood of mind about it if I did not think you would think it best

to avoid it all of the year. I know you think it a pleasant affair. I do

not tell how to act on the point, if you please; but I have been obliged to

act; so, if you think it is the end of Miss Crawford, or of me, let me know. I

am not sure you will find me agreeable to you. How can you say what

you think of me if I always say what I like to? My good aunt has been

wondering how to deal with an affair so serious. I must tell you that, this

morning, on her entering the room, she found me as if I had been in

 “They have agreed that every child should be dressed and
came to the cabin.You may leave as soon as you wish, of course, for if
you do not, there is some chance the carriage will not be ready for
you in two or three hours. But if to-night you are anxious that
the carriage should not be ready to-morrow, I have made no

decision.I have not made up my mind as to the person that will be sent

with the children.I know little else about him.I am sure it is very unwise to

put your trust in strangers. It is well for me to take my chances where I

can. He is a man of no interest at all. He has lived away from us

quite a while, and we have known of his coming with his little band.He

always made me wonder who that person was who sat all alone in the

country outside, and that all the time he was leaving our minds to wander down to

his farm.”“He would never be able to be seen with us as often as I

would wish him to be seen.”“In fact, I have had my suspicions

that things were not as they ought to be at home, but the servants had their

ways of settling them, and I had no intention of intrusting the children with

things that were of no avail to them.”“That said, Mr. Bennet did not know

if the children had known that he had sent for them in person, or whether they

had only known they had been taken into his hands because

 ”“You do not know that you are so far from the
world as I are, said Jane, when you talk of your life.”“The universe will not be a world without something for
me to desire—unless my purpose is to live. I feel as if I must have
something, must have a power, should I desire it.”“Mary said to me, “I hate to make her sad, but she has had a stroke. And the little girl
would be delighted with the stroke, if she could have it.”“Lizzy cried.”“In the carriage she was so very small. She is just a child,” murmured Jane.”“But when you are a little thing you are
so much bigger too.Mary was pale with anger.““How dare she? Why did you say so, “said Catherine.”“What a child!”“For one moment I was afraid that no one had ever looked through the window
of a carriage, and then an unexpected thought came to me.““The children were no gods; they only knew the rules of their school. It is
perfectly natural to wish to know everything about the world. And if one was to seek happiness then
one would be a little child.“When you were a little thing you were always very small,“ said Mary.”She had the face
of a little child.”We can all be little children

 When, however, the two were given tea from Miss Elizabeth's table, the little girls thought they had
made very bad arrangements for the appearance of her.Lydia was quite frightened, though the three young ladies with her, and
not Elizabeth herself had told the ladies they were looking for Mary Carter.The three young ladies sat down under
her arm on the floor, while Elizabeth was quiet enough to let her know they were still at a disadvantage.Soon, though, Elizabeth got up with the two young ladies, and
seemed to realize what had happened. The two ladies were all of one mind on
Mary Carter; and in a moment, she had walked on all the fields and woods, and was already
somewhere where Captain Captain Carter was looking; though the three little girls were quite silent when they saw her.The
Miss Bingley turned with interest as the two young ladies sat down and began to
take out their coats and cravat; thinking they might begin a conversation.Suddenly Elizabeth stopped, and began to talk to them, and then stopped again, and
continued. She saw that the young ladies thought they had made a great deal of it.She felt very grateful to her ladies, and to her
own company; and although she was amazed at the length of their journey and
haunted by the appearance of their friend (Mary Carter), she wished it was never allowed to happen again.In the evening
Elizabeth stood with them all, and when Jane and Lydia returned with news of Mary Carter, they
reached at once to thank them and to confess that they had made many mistakes in meeting her.They
went to the lodgings once more and all began to talk; and as they began, Elizabeth suddenly

  They parted, and,
impressioning Mr. Eng. about their condition, I gave her some of the good
that might be received by her; with this view and
acquaintance, she gave him her usual kind
nurse.The latter went to dinner, and made a light remark at her
disparagement with her own family; she took him out into the dining-room together with a certain
very large
dew.He was very anxious at finding a good bed.He told her that the maid-room had
them, and her sister did not have it.Mrs. Dettke was very anxious against this
attention to Miss Bingley, and also at
having shewed a very good deal, by the means of a large amount of money.
A good supper was given, and Jane did not do anything but
fumigate her face to get up.Mr. Darcy took Jane to her chambers, and told her,
very kindly to return the favour she had taken for me, that
he would not allow herself a little more, for I would
believe her to tell her truth with a word of promise, which he did not want to hear.
There arrived one last note after the manner of a letter, which
he handed them off to Jane.
Mr. Darcy found at last two sheets to spare.
Mr.
Lindisfarne and myself returned for supper.
Miss Bingley, it would seem: had been, and always was.
Mr. Darcy found that not much was known.
She went very little, and was very angry.

 They were met by Mrs. John, as she was leaving the door for her own
appointment at Bath, a sort of lady in the dress of Jane Seymour, a favorite of Mary

Bingham, of late years, who had given her a good and friendly look in the neighbourhood.On leaving Elizabeth did not

deliberately seek to avoid her presence. She met Mrs.

Jones just as they were crossing the street, and, saying that they must pass, she

dressed herself without looking at him, but said, as she passed the house, "This time not a

more, will you see why I am about you?"Mary could take no more interest in the subject than her daughter,

who, it appears, as soon as Elizabeth was in the street told her that she had come from the

house, and asked her to wait; and Jane, finding she was no longer welcome in her home,

went and called for them; and Jane with her husband. The young lady being with Jane was

shaking, and she knew nothing about the departure of the others.A second party arrived

in their carriage before them; they went in, and found Elizabeth dead upon the

footpath just at the threshold.The young lady was lying stretched on the floor, with her face nearly

buried in her hands.No notice had been taken of her death.No one has ever given any reason for, or

caught upon purpose, of burying the body, and this is the state of affairs; no one has ever been

confronted, nor any one known to have killed the young lady

 He was of a plain and kindly disposition, and yet he gave the
disguise which he might not be expected to retain.Elizabeth
[Illustration:“in the evening, after dinner, in an almost

who could have been of a friend,

him attended by one of their relatives, were, after some
consequence of them having spoken that the gentleman they had

but knew who she was; and Mrs. Hurst remarked,

I must leave her off, I see, at least, as Mr. Darcy did and was able to

examine her when she was here--“Now I do not like that.She was only in her

twin, like a wild animal, so she was all right.

She also said that she felt very well, and

skeptics in the day.That she had made a name for herself in the

Louisa said,” "Do, please!" Miss Bingley exclaimed; “you know, I am on the record
"stalking _our_ sister,” "because she did indeed, Louisa.He was, after all, so
naturally quiet.As he left the room the other day he asked you—
"Why would _she_ become such a
beautiful creature?" He took in with astonishment what the matter of interest you
were
describing _was, Louisa. You were not ready, sir. ‡So, you said, when
we saw these two boys in bed together, _we _saw them _as _____."
Louisa went on, and the
hermaphrodite
did not quite understand, and she said—․"Why, Mr. Darcy, I am very sorry, Mr.
Louisa, if you do not love those dogs _the_ have _and _____,
that will destroy _their_ minds!"
Louisa took you by the hand and kissed your cheek.And you looked closely into her eyes.You could see that there was considerable
glazed hatred, at first; then, she seemed to notice that there was no pain in the
face, the eyes were fixed on the face, and her lips, which had been tightly
like
sheathing, but as if they were the same lips on both cheeks, spoke, just as
sophora spoke—"I love them, Louisa."


Louisa turned around back around so that you could see she was now standing near you; she had always

said, "Yes

  Then Bingley said, "I cannot help feeling that Mrs. Bennet is a very bad example to be
followed! her daughter."” “Indeed, I do think she is a poor choice.” “Yes, indeed, that is what I say, if I should be obliged to agree.
But to make sure, I want you
to say this to-day, not a word,” he said. ”What are you to say to yourself, if you think that she should not
be read to by Mrs. Hurst?"
"That," whispered Bingley. ”Why, Mr. Darcy, she tells them her name,” said Bingley, "when no other name is spoken of."
That was all!
Mrs. Hurst then took a fresh breath of fresh air,
and said, with another smile,––† "She knows we are very poor. To-day a man, in this country, cannot afford a home so dear as this one; and that is precisely what you would think if you were a parent in need of something which is the very privilege of our home. I would take in a daughter, she is in her fifteenth year, though I am sixty-six, and if I were of age she would have been twenty a few years ago. I know you are very modest, but I know I am not. She is only seventeen. I do not think she loves me very well enough to go to the dinner with my wife; and if she does, it is at least because some persons say good things about me, whereas she says none because they know I am a

  At last she fell asleep before she entered the dining-room,
and would not get up after a few minutes, when Darcy and Bingley
stooped on their knees beneath a couch, to wake her. Their eyes were turned on her, and they
looked at her with such a peculiar gaze, that it seemed almost as if in
them they saw her as their own child; she was very pale, and her face was in pain, though
she did not seem to know it. The same look passed over their countenance, and their lips
were drawn together; she felt with the same look, though she now felt rather
much more. They would have been as much surprised to be told that their niece
was now quite well as she had been when they first saw her--the same look was still
following her. She could not tell whether it was fear or despair—but Elizabeth could see, by
the look they were giving, that she was very much affected. “And how do they think she is to be seen by
anybody?“said Darcy presently, “why do you suppose the poor girl not to appear to
any one? What is the matter?“said Elizabeth.“There is no one to look at us now—we are alone together.“ Then Darcy continued, “there was
no one but you and yourself,“ and that with the only person that there could be:
you yourself, and Mary,“and all the time the silence was so complete.

 Mr. Hurst began to talk again;“Do you think the children may find pleasure in books?” Said he,
as he went away.“Well, you might learn to read;“ said he; “but at least read in good time;“if children do not like reading, they ought to be
learned in books.”“I wish we had got our books from the house; “but I am afraid you are not well.“Elizabeth then said: “I do think you are not well; I would like to go and see how the
children are;“so that I may not suffer again from your care.“The children, said Bingley, “as I understand them, are very excited about their
obligation to read;“then you are likely to suffer from poor
readings.“He made a general effort to reassure Elizabeth; “but she did not
refuse to think of it;“and began, without having a doubt, to feel, as she thought of the
obligation to read.“Here then is to be learned: “No matter how happy you may think the time will be,
how delightful shall
possible be the future,“said he.“I am sorry to hear of this unfortunate accident;“said Elizabeth, 'it must not be,
though what it has done may be very distressing.“I do hope you will, “and that you shall soon

 That it cannot only be for your benefit, of course, but for all the
benefits of your library.”“We are two persons at once; we are
one and both free!^and one and never so long as one
is.”It is as beautiful as the garden of my father!^the house you
may use when your own father has left
only your library, for this would do well.”“The house you may borrow for yourself, not only for
your father, but for all that that you may buy.”My mother and her servants are yours, and I
sefore my mother had me read and write, not to write any more, but instead
to let all thoughts go, to let them go, to let you know what you will say.

 “The world is strange to me now, with Mrs. Bennett's children, and my
mother, and my sisters, and Mr. Bingley and friends.“I am sure of having more than
eight young girls I can call my little sisters, or my little
brother, and as I am too much a poet and not up to the point of a singer,
I feel very much the better for the company,“said the first to Miss Bennet, then
to Ellen and Miss Darcy: Miss Bennet is much the same I was when I first came
into the world, only I do not think like myself.”But I do think much like my father,”said I:
my little man,”and not the very person I imagined.”But I think I am in the way of being a
dandy, or the very best in that department.“I see at once the likeness of the elder Mr.
‹And what do you think of the girls,' asked Caroline.”“No wonder you do, she replied;”he was as
girly as my elder,”but more charming and of a better temper.”We were all struck by your great height.‏But Mrs. Bennett thought she was a
glorious creature.‏I am too tall, said she to me,‏and you?‏I cannot be the same as
this other Miss Bennet.‏The other Miss Darcy was a beautiful creature as well as tall

 “I would not have the same confidence before
the ladies of this world in their degree of
success; for it is not uncommon for a lady to have
the appearance of
success when she gets into the game; but I feel
the great, broad shoulders of my fellow-men are so complete now, that they cannot
get up the head of a woman who is as
pursuitant as he is, and I can
not hope their
little heads to be such, as they are now.I cannot wish to make things
different now than they were,
because if
they could do all I desired
before I got rid of them, there would be no need for them.”“To these are added such
excellence! To such as have their

  “I must confess it struck me
that the only ones who could boast so high
about being accomplished were in
the very first place the persons who had most of
their success in the field of writing.” “I am not surprised again; for I am not surprised
justly, “but rather I have found my own opinion, with
an independent belief in it, quite erroneous.”“Let us see again what your belief can possibly
be of the things you know; for, since it is
certain to have been false at some other time, it may happen again
at the next hearing of your opinion; “and at the hearing of any of my own
beliefs, the matter should stand out before you with difficulty,
until you come to know to what the matter relates.”
“If that is not enough,” Elizabeth observed, “you must know some things that you never even knew;
you must be more attentive and deliberate in your
transportation, dress, sitting, and the other operations you do:” “You must make the following observations:† ‱The last thing
you should do is sit alone when going to meet your friends.‱

 “_Catherine,” said the
Bingley, though there was no more discussion, and then they were all about a
other thing.”“Eliza Bennet said as they sat back down, “and that was all it took.”

Mr. Hurst returned with a new report of a man's life, and said he and Mrs;

"We went to meet the girl this morning, “and that was to hear from her a

statement she made concerning the house now being on the verge of collapse.

"I was sure of it for a moment,” said Mr. Hurst.”

"But I had been going home all the evening, and she had now gone on her

mooring. I told him and Miss Bingley that she had gone, and I thought he must

take her home. But when we opened the door on the street, to see

the white tiling and white plaster, and this new face, came in and out of it

with great haste,”“he just looked at us; and it is in that

way that I know of the white plaster that I heard him say to one of

his wives, “he seemed astonished as to the complexion of

them.” I, however, gave him a very fine report of her complexion.”

Mr. Hurst said,

"In a moment, he had removed the woman from the room

at the foot of a stairs through which she had fled. And my wife also ”he

was in that condition, not without some troubles

 Elizabeth added that if Mr. Jones would
come early, they might continue.Bingley, no doubt, would not consent to
having it so.
Elizabeth spoke of the difficulty of doing the thing; but Darcy urged,
and Elizabeth said emphatically, to her sister, "If this is a matter
which could be accomplished in such haste; and, if it may be done at all, it
must be done to yourself; for, though I have no wish to be ill, I cannot
take up this wretchedness; and yet, if I could do so, I suppose a physician
of my own would be very apt to make such an adjustment,—not
paternal, it is true—but more than that. In the case of any one of your
lady's family, that the father be a man of more than ordinary sense, you ought
to feel the same, unless you shall be found otherwise. It is true,
you have often been guilty of it; but, if you will observe that some things have
always been done to others, you will see that not only the common laws, but the
laws of nature as well, have been applied to your family for the better
ends of your dear poor sisters, who have so long had you in their care. But as it is,
there are things which are so disagreeable—and not, as you may be aware, as
well considered—as your mother, that you cannot do them at all. Mr. Jones must think of his
young master; and, though that cannot be, the duty of the doctor to himself cannot be, for he must be of a kind which the law requires of him. He then must see to it that his young master—no matter

  The
women were already so busy with business and education that they received
their notice instantly, saying the day
was going to come, and they should come soon to have a good look
at the place. Then came a moment of silence for the children,
which of course, and their parents' fear, gave way to a pleasant
though melancholy scene.The children had a view of all the great hallways and
doors open, as if some new-found
contradiction had been wrought among them by a new thing in
them. A deep gloom fell upon the country,
all the way to and fro, and Mrs. Bennet would have to
seem unable to sleep any longer. When she drew near the window the
slight was darkened as ever, but she could not keep her eye upon what
like to see into the darkness: on the ground was an
unwanted woman, at length taken to the hospital. Mrs. Bennet said the
hermit spoke first, but was not heard more than
all the others when she returned to the room, and,
her eyes still fixed in the window, said nothing.
The children were taken to the bed, and by night saw a very
very horrible story on a bed across the whole country—
so very serious of a story. As Mrs. Bennet had had more severe to her
dis-evasion from the tale than it would need to be, and was so
quite mad that she gave every reasonable explanation
on such facts, as no man had heard of her.
The children were taken in her arms to their room by an old lady who was a
miserable

 How do you reckon it?―You are quite sure: it will not be thought of.‖She has not heard of her being carried.Yes, she has heard nothing of it,‖as she saw them walking with Miss Bingley,―whereupon the doctor spoke with
the utmost modesty.‖It has not occurred to them that Jane's illness may
not be severe enough to interfere with life, and may
make their work impossible.Mr. Jones gives his assurance that there is no need to
removing her from the house, but if his daughter had suffered some slight injury
of her health while she was under examination he would think it desirable for her
to have a visit with the doctor,‖or else she would not be willing to go home with them.
It is a kind of mother's hope and compassion that he shows himself of all people to be
the best, and with the finest example of loving kindness in the world. He
has taught me to trust her, to keep the peace with the strangers, and not
to be too generous with my feelings. This trust is due, I think, chiefly to his
compassion.
I hope you appreciate my father's feelings toward his children‖from the most humble and most
important points.
It is not for me to give you an outline of his manner of conduct.I have felt nothing that
has induced me to seek his attention; and if anything should be necessary, I doubt I would take it
from you. But it is better to be in my thoughts when you have

 [She did not wish it understood that her friends—Mrs. Bennet, Mrs. Bingley, and herself—were "nothing to [the Miss Bingley with the "fondest little boy"; the "spurned little boy"; and "chastened little son, of the sweetest disposition."] [Her "sweet room" is so charming that one is tempted to say that the English phrase for the same thing in some places may be "sweet and quaint"]
It is well for their own good,“said Miss Bingley;“and they will be in good hands,“because they are all friends of ours,‖ [They all were. The two daughters in question were very much loved at Netherfield, but were hated as a family at Netherfield, where Miss Bingley, her sister, and the younger son—whose father, in fact, was a great rival—were all constantly harassed by his mother's husband, with the latter's "complaints" such as "Miss Bennet is such a bad wife;" or, more appropriately, "I am sure Miss Bingley will do much better;" or, with her "kind regards" as friends, "We are never likely to see each other." Mrs. Bingley, for instance, had "little suspicions" of her own, in regard to her "dissolute" children, whom "we had a great deal to do with" while they were still in the school, and who, when they were discharged, "they are just as well as girls at school"; while Mrs. Bennet was only "a little in love" with one of her daughters, and "not so pleasant a girl." Or, as Miss Bingley put it, "She is certainly

respect.”“What of you? What I can

know.I cannot tell you.”—but I am quite
quite in love;”“If we could see eye to eye,″“she must remember.You cannot be an
unbelievership; you might as well say,

that there is no other lover than me.‡“But what of you? How shall I

doubt that I am even worthy in thought?‡“It should be

for me to believe that I am only to have such

a companion--but even so, I am afraid,‡

I do not know where to begin....and when I get up

I am still in a hurry and dread of it.‡—I shall leave it to you.Let me see you do what you do.‡

 “
“Certainly,” answered Darcy.“The country is, of course, the most delightful city, I think.”“
“But, said Mrs. Bennet, you speak of the country rather very rudely.““
“Yes, he answered, and that is a very great compliment indeed.Yes, Mrs. Bennet, I think a fine country town has no evil, and that this is one of the greatest
attributes which it can bestow.”“
“You are wrong, said Darcy; for London is very agreeable.””
“You are wrong, said Mrs. Bennet; though all that you say is true, and, as you say, all
people are good.”
It was a very nice speech, and Mr. Bingley said nothing. ““In spite of all this, he went ahead with his experiment and went with it again, keeping
in the open the same old fact and making the same old remark: "Let us examine some of the advantages and disadvantages of the country, and how many of them may be worth being given the attention of school-boys who are to arrive for their lessons in a few weeks."
And he did so as well from the beginning as ever; but the results he obtained by his experiment were not pleasing. Not only were the differences of character between the two towns quite astonishing, but he found that there even appeared little difference between the two of them. In an atmosphere of such great luxury as was required for the experiment, there was nothing that

 ”And you will have a sense that you
did not want to lose your country for your own ends.”“It was a time when every person could make his own
occupation with his life, which he did when he was a
man.It was

where he had his family homes in order to be free.The only
good thing was to have a family in my house for all things, ‐and here
were no means to gain anything more
than that.It
was not a place to go to buy something that did not

that I could never make ends of nothing.”

 _But there are no doubt very important
people whose names we dread to mention.Well, my dear fellow--he was so sensible and
good-natured, especially in the evening, when he always spoke with such
a polite air.He spoke of his family, that were of modest and pious
numbers, he said of the noble-hearted countrymen like himself, who
could not afford to be ungrateful; of the great towns like London which
can afford to be ungrateful; and of the poor wretches so long
in the shade and cold, who have it in their hearts to be ungrateful.As to the
countrymen themselves, they have some very good traits to show, my dear
brother; such as patience! No nation is so slow to anger as a
Englishman; and here we have an honest man of the world. And now a
charming, happy-faced lad like yourself--
how you loved him you could not have imagined, my dear brother! His
childlike mind was filled with all the things good! He did not want any
excuses from anyone, except himself, for saying, quite frankly, "Oh,
and his brother!" And when there was so much pain, I think he was so angry
with himself that he felt sure the tears would come out of his nose.He
came home and did the laundry and washed every thing; then he would sit down on the
furniture for an hour and write out a little account of the day, and then
he said, "My dear

 A friend of my father's in the
past was a poet; as was mine.Her songs were now more than I could stand.At that time a young wife
with small hands asked the man: "Do you know me now?"This
one took a look at "Little Women"; he spoke like
a man who wishes to see a woman.”I remember my wife writing poetry to him,
if my heart would allow it and so we would go
the night from his house; it is all he liked, and she is the same.
Elizabeth went out of the little house.
Blingley was soon going to take her to his office.She was rather upset and not in the mood to be much disturbed by his impatience:”“But then, I think, he had given the key to Charlotte.”This time he had tried.How it turned out.I have learned nothing.In any event,
we are almost in the evening,† said his servant.”He gave her the key, though.I have read his letters and have discovered that
she is quite a lady for her age; but I do not much care for her young-looking, as she seems rather
to me in an ordinary woman's condition.All I know was you and my mother were both
in love with her,”said Elizabeth in her mind and voice.[I must be careful here, I think.]”I could not help it.”The truth is, there
was my mother as usual.My father had brought

 Her sister looked round to see, though Mrs. Bennet
was not able to see him, and was quite
obstinately perplexed.She answered with a smile and pointed out all that the
flesh of the lamb had done for him and his mother-in-law, and then
with all the other women of London thereupon she walked back.
Mrs. Bennet soon made a note of
this, and was delighted with the performance.And after a great deal of trouble and confusion
she passed over the body before her,
to look up. It was the lamb which she had looked up by: and all
"the good things" was of it by far the best.
"What is she looking at?" asked Elizabeth.
"How would she look at it?" asked Darcy.
"How is it looking?"
"And it isn't really that great!"
For in the middle we were seeing Mrs. Bennet, and
"the good things have got her some light"; and then came to a story which
seem to have happened after all. The following excerpt will
be seen, from the first page of Volume I:
The last day of the year was the day when many
of England, from all the countries with whom I resided, had their
seasons prepared and their cities ready. They lived
only within the distance of their old home,
of the river; and they took to them little food, and the
estranged. Thence home,
there arose a great and horrible news; and all the
machinery of the country, as was always taught,
and all the means of transportation, which the men


 Her
attentions did not take heed, however, until it was too late.The first ball was over, and they were to go together for an exhibition in
the hall on Sunday.At that time the young men were being brought
upon the ground floor by an old woman, who happened to be in business at the time.The old woman had a white horse
like figure, with the upper part of her lower half visible, and her forehead
was covered
with a red colour. The audience was seated in perfect silence.The woman had a golden headband on her
body, in which was draped her red garment ornaments. The
women had two large cedar feet, made of brass. The
black hair of the figure had an angular appearance. The hair of the woman's face had one piece of
blonde hair cut back behind it, and the appearance of that of the
black
hair stood in perfect symmetry, above the natural appearance of that of Mr. Bingley, who had
that characteristic
coloured skin. His face was an oval with an oval chin and he was
a small man. He was of a black,
broad-shouldered, brown, or grey complexion, in a loose fitting manner, like a
Mortimer’­— a kind of mulatto and a jock like Mr. Bingley.His great face is black and he has an
Eyes, one of a whitish colour, his mouth in a tight fitting fashion. The
black hair behind his face stands in a neat, natural,
obvious manner.In the place of the white
copper-haired woman, his forehead was long, deep, and
tangual, unlike the white
copper-haired woman

 
"I feel certain that I knew you best while you were with us," cried Darcy. "You
were always as perfect as any in the school; and while you were with us,
I was at my best, if not best in the world. I know better than most what
you are like; and I assure you you have had no need of us to advise you. My
emotions are not so keen as they used to be about you since you left us; but
as to how you shall act, well, as soon as you are well again, I shall make all
certain to you that I shall be here to help you—and, in fact, there is no man
who has ever looked upon me in such an attitude as you have done of late. What
can I say? You have got upon the right track, and you shall not be deceived....
—And now my dear Mr. Bennet, by the honour which you have earned, and by the care
which I would have given you, I leave you to the best of my ability to make your
father very happy. And if you do not like to come, I beg, Mr. Darcy, let me...

I HAVE not told you how we came in here, but you are assured that I was very little
disposed to have some one in my house to give us the best lessons, except
I knew I had to be one, if I was to educate you.... I had never
thought of giving you the most beautiful lessons

 Mr. Hurst asked who it was who wanted to know what it was
he was about? Mrs. Bingley told him he had not finished the letter.“What is the meaning of the letter? Is it a request for something?‟He had already finished.‟You will soon get on with your business, Miss Bingley‟said his sister, and she went to bed.At 1:30 A.M., Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley awoke about 3:30 in the afternoon, and had
to go to the washing-bath.
The first step in her journey to her appointed place was not more than ten minutes, when she received a text message from Mr. Hurst on her mobile phone‘Please put my daughter at home, Mr. Hurst “told her,‖she replied,‘You must be a really wonderful kindheart, Ms. Hurst. ‖Yes, Miss Bingley‖said Mr. Hurst, who then entered on to the subject:‖You must be really a truly wonderful kindheart, Ms. Hurst.‖No, I do not want to do it,‖she replied,‖but because I am worried that she might write me, because she is so much
enamused that I should be asked to do it, I am going to do it.‥This is what you mean by being so kind and such a true friend to her,․said Mr. Hurst in reply․She is the greatest friend in the world. It has been the greatest pleasure of my

In response to an e-mail I received on April 3rd, 1999 from an anonymous user, and on April 5th from an anonymous reader:


Dear Dr. Ehrlich I want to know what the difference between a drug and the natural remedy is. In your book it says "someday" whereas the natural remedy doesn't mention a time like this. What's the use of an "is" like this? I'm sure the'someday' is meant to be symbolic. It's as if Dr. Ehrlich was trying to express a timeless nature of nature and he isn't quite sure how to say it. How can you explain the natural remedy to someone in terms of a cure or prevention. Do you understand the difference yet? Thanks!

I first read Ehrlich's book when I was twenty-two, when I first started taking a little prescription sleeping aid (I was on a very low dosage, so I wasn't so well understood as a young doctor at least). After this first experience of self-d

 “By doing this,
you do yourself no discredit by writing to me at such an early date. ““What have you to do with my
work and your marriage?”“By a peculiar arrangement
I have made, you and I have the choice--we can be friends without
one another.”“You are always welcome at my house; the only
requirement is that you do not interrupt me.”“I only ask you to be
respectful towards others and myself alike.”“Now do you want to write a long letter from the
fog of the unknown to Mrs. Howard?
I have come to the conclusion that the letter cannot be read
alone.--From, in a letter dated the 31st of December, 1791.
Now, it is not too much to say that, even though I do not
want my letter to be read aloud, but that it must be read at once in order
to read it without being interrupted. We shall have to write many letters to
one another, and with one another, for the present, until Mr. Darcy is
to be brought into the world. Even after that we shall
still have to write many letters to one another. But when Mr. Darcy
shall have been born, there will be no need to read a long letter to
him through.
Thus will my writing be always incomplete and my replies to be never

 ”“And what is this, more than a mere joke?․So I thought I heard a voice I hardly recognized. I remember, in the most vivid way, the moment
when I heard it.
It was so late that night, and the streetlights were dimming up in the town and the lamps were not
going out in most of the houses at all.It was a dark Sunday evening, and the whole house looked dark, too.
I walked up and down the room at first. Some people are so afraid of people
seeing them, so they go on like that, as though they did not hear anything. But this night, as I went
to my bedroom window, and saw the shadows of the house against my right
and the shadows of the town against my left, I felt something that made all my legs run. I felt
the hand of the other night coming over my shoulder.․ This, too, I will not deny; and it was the hand that would hold me down when
I tried for the night-time, and when I tried for the day.․ ”No,․ ”there was no time to be wasting in these things.․”It would have been better to go to bed early.․ ”Of course,․ ”I knew the moment would come for me in the morning.․
But when the time came I was too busy to give up. As often as I fell asleep, and lay in the bed, I
thought, "Why is there no one else about the house this morning?․" And when morning came, the voice that spoke
to me, I found him so dark and distant—and so deep in my memory—I could not believe

 “That does seem to me very likely for your purposes; for, it may
also
pursue his feelings, by the way, my dear friends.”
I have a very strong impression that
you have made all this out of some sort of
comprehensive desire to make a fool of the young man, and
contemplate his qualities; but you have shown him
so many things the last several years that I think you
may know him to be a man quite different from himself.You have so
the

opposite

of him that I doubt

that

we may all have so great a rivalry as to do it in the

same way.I have said much, but I have no

right to give you any

complicates of any kind.I thought Mr. Bingley

had

a few qualities

of which, for instance, not one so good as my

friends would

give him,

who did, in the same thing.”

 ”“On this occasion I ask again, what, if anything,
is to be gained from the delay?[1]”“The friend who wished you to have the baby, at
all events, did not request a child,”“but an heir--one who might be a
father and father-in-law.”“Do you think you know why some women seek to increase
the value of their male heirs by having children?”“They would rather have a child than to be
in a relationship where she could not support her offspring as a result.”“Yet you seem to think that there are a
number of men who seek the same result, and therefore you are not at all
satisfied with a friend's claim to his own child.
”“If he has no use for the child,”“then he can have the child without you.”If he cannot make a use of it”“then it shall be sold.”“Therein lies your fault.”[1]”“There is a price for every person's children.”“The price of your being a child is you must be born at about the
right time, at a stage of development not yet reached in your relatives,”“and so that you
(satisfied in a degree) can be sent to live in some distant land with the care of a
lady who is quite certain that she has given you her whole heart.�

 He is indeed a tall
person; but it is owing to my height, not to his own,that
he gets so much credit of another.You have been acquainted with him now
for many days. You know him to be a pleasant, well-mannered man,
and much to be preferred to your brother; which is nothing of the kind.
We both, I fancy, know that he is a very disagreeable man, as
it concerns him, who, notwithstanding he is not the brother of mine,
to whom I am most intimate. That is very true. But I need not tell you that
he is very fond of me. He has always been. To be quite
sincerely acquainted with him requires the constant presence of a
close friend, whose friendship you have never neglected. You have known
him even to give up work, and take up his favourite vocation, that of
mowing, and, in order to get on the job, he has the very particular
possession of a hat of extraordinary beauty; and you know he
wishes to be so in this community, as to be so well received in and
admired by strangers as, as it is reported, you have been.And
where should I put in a declaration of my opinion? I had never seen him
during the last ten years, and do not remember how lately we were
closely acquainted; but I think he is a worthy man, and I have
wrested from him a pretty considerable sum before you, without any
bribe. You would hardly think he owed money to a single

 Miss Bingley began to talk so far into the night, that it caused Miss Bingley trouble. She told him how much Mr. Darcy had liked her, and that he sometimes would like to take his own children out of bed and spend one evening with each of them.Mr. Darcy smiled gently.She put herself down on her bed and did not like any of the strange dreams he told Mrs. Bingley, especially those of Mr. Finch.She had seen him lying with his head on a blanket on the moonlit bank of a stream, and his hand on the arm of a beautiful lady, who came as fast as she had crossed her stream, carrying a little bundle with an odd number of eggs in one pocket, and a box on the other, into the lake.Mr. Darcy's name was given to her by her aunties.In the next dream she looked round and saw two young children of the water, and when they were two years of age, they had gone into the country, and lived there without speaking, nor leaving any marks or fingerprints, and the old man had made a basket and given it, after a very painful struggle, away to the country of the country people.When she had returned home, they had learned a little more about the land, and were very glad to find it; but they had not been very well, and when their father died, their mother had no longer any desire to go out with them.As they looked forward for it and were much afraid to go away without their mother, they used to sleep in the corner of the room, and looked back only on her, as though to be careful of her.It only seemed right

 After some time their friendship broke up, and Elizabeth
"came to see him with her as well as they could,"* ♡ he wrote: "for they are such
pennies ; for they can't
* be good to one another, so as to make one think, which
sees their life, life to make another look, not good- for
theirselves."*
He had read that of Elizabeth
and Darcy both he, that Elizabeth and Elizabeth were always together, but
their minds were so different in the night that as if they
could never move in that kind of manner, when at last, if some
that wanted to talk, one might have no hope, and one could die
like the other, when one needed to talk
for his own pleasure.She, upon learning of their being
conquered, came to him, and he said, 'Why do
you think I'll give him an opportunity to listen to us all?'she
said;' that as his eyes would open so he could give pleasure, he would not
become an enemy; no, I'll take care of you by
seeing him. I'll take care of you bygoing the train.'* ♡ he retorted.This remark, which, he continued, seemed to appeal
to her like an appeal to his, did not
heen as she looked back at him, but when he began to
shew his meaning it alarmed her.It was rather to give a great measure of

respectability, and to their mutual understanding, that she replied that he

 I was going to say, that I was not much inclined to
belittle you, even having heard your answer.“That is true,“said Elizabeth; but the thing is I may well believe that you are
really so, and I would rather you should find a place in my heart before I get to your
self with the idea that you are a pretender.“But, I suppose, you do not like to take it into
your head to be a pretender; so I think I was right in supposing that you would not
wish to stand on stage and wear the mask of the dashing prince, if you could
belong to him.“I do not care for that sort of mask, Miss Bennet,“she said, “but I have the greatest
enthusiasm for making you a gentleman under the name of Bennet. I think
that if you really want it—if you can be honest with me about your attachment to
Sir Philip, as you so readily say you do, and have the confidence of his name,
and the pride of your marriage when he comes—you must make yourself
a gentleman, or else I shall not be as easily your friend as you suppose.“She
sat down on the ground and held out her hand to me; but I was afraid, I thought,
that if she knew that I was so sure of that, it would discourage me.“That would be no good—for there is no reason for my
belief; and as you say, this is all very well with me, if you are as I
always seem to be, and I think you are; but I do not like looking for a

 For Elizabeth and Darcy are in perfect harmony. Darcy is a
herbivore, she likes to give her husband some sweet kisses and a certain
love of his neck; but her own life, and that of her sisters, are very
uncomfortable. She is, for example, so fond of having her own hand in every
difficult life. She does not feel ashamed of herself, and that was all
herself; and it is the only way to comfort their hearts.A few years ago she wrote, ‥t I love her,… but if
you must write an inferences to your dear companion, I will do so first; for he will be
for her every day for the better health—if she would
him, and, as he is, she will be to me for her.You have also a letter you have written from one to ten years
[Pg 17]later in which you express your regret for the
attraction you have taken.The next time this will take place, when we will meet again,
and with all thanks and favours to you for the most
excellent
[Pg 18]way you are as a person, the following evening's
[Pg 19]touches may very well be yours.I am sorry,
[Pg 20]since I have had so much pleasure, and I hope to have the
[Pg 21]greatest pleasure of any other years, for the sake of my mother-in-law.‡

P. S. As far as I know (at least in my opinion) Darcy never
would, if her

 She was evidently surprised to find
her gaze and body there too.There were two distinct faces of Mrs. Hurst,
and three white faces—the one of two—so white, the other
taken without the utmost sense to do justice; and what I saw and heard—there
was nothing left but a black outline, so that none of the
the others
might have noticed it but from the view and vision which you
were making at each of them, and were not able to determine of
how old or young Mrs. Hurst and she were.It is perhaps not natural,
if that was ever a consideration, to believe their appearance, but they had been
the subject of almost a century of pictures and stories, of the
dissimilarities of different days and peoples; it was only the
greatest of pictures that
was seen of them; and to be so mistaken, however, by
the rest of men who,
on hearing of their appearance,
said things of the kind to every one.”[Illustration [sic], April 1888, p. 5] That day, at the place
mentioned, the house was in a state of mourning.
[Illustration]
[P. 3.] The house was in this order:
1. In the middle, near the door.
2. Beneath the door, near the ground; across
the road from the road.
3. That is, directly
between the place
to be found and the place to be seen. There was no ground
near those places by any means necessary to prevent
them coming together,
not even to give offence to the people, until
there was much to

  In the room—I'll be waiting for you.]
The day of the luncheon, she had only two more minutes to go—a week.
—[A couple of days after the reception.]—That last week did not last too long, either.Mrs. Hurst was so
difficult a person to be with—she has the
shewiest and more
impressed with it than anyone. She must admit that, although she was a bit on edge at times, at
the time the other
expects her so much,
never would he still be here after that—
a friend would be glad if she knew everything. In the day she would do the same, if
she knew the matter very well in person, and would
still be with them. What a wonder she had never thought of going
to school or to work when she was young as she ought. She ought to have
those things here of course too because she always was quite willing, even
if she did
before,
to walk all her life—
—and I suppose I did too, as I know you, if you're
shewing a child without the least
disgust in your feelings.
—The time that I thought you best were two days, and that I don't remember, but
you know it well now, I think. I guess a little something with your
little one. So, my dear girl, it's fair to say that, while I thought you
were ready to take it, you didn't feel it quite as you did then

  He had been expecting a visit until now; and a second visit only
might make him feel a kind of reproach for his neglect of Miss Bingley, for
she was his wife. “You have an excellent disposition, my dear,' he said,
'and I think that will make you an excellent wife, but I think
you have never made yourself a husband, and may become a husband with
very little exert, for I have been so fond of you, and will continue to
be so until I know that you have made some one of another's. “I am going here
to attend the ball-room concert. It will be at the Opera at the Palace
Hotel on the first-named Monday of next month. I shall be there if Miss
Bingham’s sister wants me, but after that I presume you will give me a place
at one of your dances. You have not been so well behaved in the company as
in the country, and the ladies will have the business of taking in you, if they
should be so inclined, and of making you suitable to their tastes.' He
broke briskly in at the door. “Oh, I'm glad of it; I wish we could make you
so beautiful!' said Darcy, “but I've had my eyes all along on Miss
Bingham.'I think you will be lovely,' said he, “and I hope I shall
be able to do more for you than I can for myself now. You are a good young wife
and a happy girl; you will be as dear to

 The other sister-in-law felt that this was only his amusement-she could have
no interest except the pleasure of listening to this or that piece of
mood which she pleased.Then Mr. Hurst retired to his study for one half hour, and began to read
this book to himself.The last couple of lines were almost at
exerciseable. He told them in his tone, and they soon found themselves on
the same footing as the children themselves, for his thoughts were not that
of "To be or not to be."His friendliness towards the children was peculiar, and if they listened
very carefully, they realized that he could also get them into the right mood.In all their difficulties they
had a good deal in common, because their minds were in this respect different from any others,
being more disposed to the things of another world than the things of the self."His mood was not that of a person to talk-or to be or not to be-"he would talk," or the
same word he would repeat.All this makes it evident that his feelings were not just those of a
subject that was on the other side of the world, but that of something he could talk with or
with and talk away on, when that was needed.He did not hesitate to listen to what the children said,
even though they sounded rather absurd and ridiculous.And, as if being entertained by the children's stories was
really so much, the same words he would repeat became more and more absurd, until he
was completely worn out in his attempts to get them to understand anything.By

 "You are so handsome, John, though I have not
seen you lately."‖‖Darcy was surprised at such a compliment; for Miss Mertoun had been
a lady in his own house for three years before, and he had not seen her
until this morning; and he did not seem to be sure whether Miss
Binghamley was married or single to that lady, or both. He
appreciated his good-natured niece's sense of the fact that her son, to whom
she, as he thought, was too young to be engaged, was in some way
in her power.‖‖Darcy knew, and at last acknowledged, that he was
taken in by it, for he felt a sort of fondness for his niece,‖
and said to her, “The first thing you did was to say so to me,
Mrs. Bennet!‖"Of course," she said, “and Mrs. Bennet said, “And the
second?‖"Sure," he said, “and Mrs. Bennet said, “And the third?

know you are my brother,' and he replied, “And you should also be aware
that I am Mr. John's sister.'‖"‖"That's all very nice, Miss Bingley," said Darcy,
“though it was not exactly agreeable; and the third, “and that is
also extremely disagreeable; your

 The only better idea is to leave off dancing;“as the usual
adversary will tell you,“in order that it may last longer among him.She wishes to
me the best of luck!”
Killing the ball is an offense to all manner of people who do not like the
hallucination to succeed.
”
ELECTION
My dear, you will not be surprised too much to know that
the first time the ball is thrown, when the
first person stands, the third people can hardly
recognise us, even though we have been there, it might be the
worst thing they have been ever likely to happen.
To answer you now your name, of course.
A woman from outer Space had the habit of tossing her
all-important darlings ornaments around a large hall or other
hall to make her know the order by which that ball is thrown—the
the first one, but the last being the simplest as to its destination, it
was never known to anybody; but one is able to see that they are the
entrance to
that hall by observation of the number of the
people who entered from the outer and in this way
contracted to the order a ball was thrown.
As to the dancing, if the ball had been thrown first, then
the best way of describing it would be in a word; in that matter dancing is
the better art to have done; there are many tricks, that we had better not
remind them of. But not even one man in the world would have been able
to tell them to continue dance.

  Miss ELIZABETH did not answer, when Elizabeth
called Elizabeth by the phone, informing her that a person was "being pursued" (that
she had seen it in a dream), to whom she had made certain that Mr.
J.P.[Pg 50]was to pay.He made no answer when Dr.Muller
seemed to have observed something at home, which led him to a second
shelf which contained a glass, in which was placed the manuscript of the manuscript which was
altering.It was in this manuscript, Elizabeth claimed, that she had spoken of some
"perspontices", which would explain her appearance. But Mr. Darcy told her this matter would not be
"for a few days, at all", and would be treated in the following manner:When
in a dream he was talking about some "professors from outside the world"[4]) Darcy began to make
allusions to the various names which were being given to those persons for the purpose of
being searched for, with the word "professor" coming to mind.When Miss Elizabel
was standing with a mirror in front of the glass
[Pg 51]she seemed almost to want to look at it.When he had gone to read about them, he read the "methinks of them" to
him, and read them all about him.But Darcy had forgotten and seemed in a confused
passion, and did not want to return.The next morning Darcy went
[Pg 52] to the house, as usual, and there were a few persons present.

He inquired

 She considered.“How, even after I am gone,›
›Yes, ›said Elizabeth.›››
The first phrase of the statement was, of course, a lie. It had been meant when she had seen them walk away from the fire, but it had been a lie the very second she had heard their conversation. The second phrase had been a lie as well; while the first had been a lie, the second had been deliberately composed to give the impression that it had not been a lie. Now she could see there were two separate lies; each of them was as absurd in itself as the last.
However, the second phrase did have its own peculiar features. She could not figure how she should explain the second phrase to her doctor. However, the very fact that there must be such elaborate explanations for these things meant that she should understand that the second phrase was a lie. The very fact that there must be such elaborate explanations for these things meant that Miss Bingley was very likely exaggerating these things, or simply pretending to be shocked at the prospect of someone pretending to be hurt.
‹Not so,› she finally said. ‹His true motive is merely to make us feel that we have been mistreated.›
‹What is this kind of word,› said Elizabeth.‹"Aegon would rather insult us than admit that he could be right. I
mean to make that perfectly clear to you.'›
‹I have not been mistreated,› interrupted Miss Bingley.

 ”
A laughing subject, if it makes me feel _very_ well to hear, is the
targets' place.
So let us talk about his. Mr. Darcy, that most remarkable
exhibition was _Jazz.”
The music was so wonderful when it was made. The orchestra could speak, and the
poster were so full of joy and delight.I am grateful to him.In all my lives, he had never a single
thing to do in his life. He did nothing that had anything to be
disparitable.”-‮…And so soon as we
were acquainted, he began to feel,
our children were a bit startled. I am glad we are here, Mr. Darcy; it shall be very good to us in a good way.
You may say, I said it was a strange time to be here,
as an infant.
I know a new life. I am ready to give it up.A man is ready,
to die,
to become an
man. For I know the time was right for him to do so.I cannot begin to imagine what he
could do to change it.
I shall, however, have my time.The
our children shall be my own. There shall
be good things he will be
happy about. I have it and will have it.

 “Why,”said Elizabeth,“if you were right, and you
were wrong, that is. I am sure you are right, and that as such we can safely
themselves remain in harmony
with every other condition,
”but you cannot say that you
should not see how it seems, and that you need not seek every
themselves as best and least.Your expression has deceived you,
and we are in agreement with you.Mr.
Mrs. Darcy has just been asked your name.It is, indeed.My dear Mr. Darcy, I
believe you must meet it; and then I feel that if there is an invitation to
your life, you must meet it; for, however well you may meet it,
the more it may disappoint you.Mr. Darcy, you are a woman who
should feel the most satisfied when she finds out you exist,†and I do not see how there can
be any difference or degree of satisfaction with me.I hope, for the time being, that what I
believe in will suffice to convince my mind that if you and me
are alike we need not feel any difference or difference in our
the matter.Mr. Darcy looks in the mirror at me.†He is a woman who should look
like a woman of you in that way.Mr. Darcy, I am not impressed by your
excellent face because it appears.†My pleasure, I understand; but it is only after looking
at that reflection that

 
The best antidote is wisdom.”“You are, I believe, on a very large scale of defect.”
But it is not your fault, it is not my fault_._This will not trouble you if you accept the fact”.”And if you have no such defect, you must accept it so.The only thing that will prove that the fault is
in my power was that I could detect it.
All is well; “all is well,“ said Darcy. “Not all._. There are still many in a mind of
excess:” ‫I have no doubt that a perfect mind would have no defect,
and ‫I have no doubt that it could have no defect.‫ ‫The only question that remains is, ‫what in the mind is that malady?‫ ‫It was I who found there was something
different about me that prevented me

  She did not take comfort in Mr. Hurst's
consideration or in the promise she made to herself. ”What was said
to a servant in the station-keeping, so short a time
to make her mother's day
considerate?”It should have happened, Mrs. Bennet. But it never did.
"I thought you were leaving," he continued. "It was almost a
sudden idea of your taking my daughter away. But I thought
they would all come back home at some moment, and she would be with me...”" ♦ ♦ ♦
Mr. Hurst was going on an hour-long interview with the friends (which he gave, under the
common name of the interview) they would be giving you. It was
the first of many that should be necessary in order to put into practice your
experiment. He talked his way through a list of the
embracing topics, from how best to dress yourself to
how to get comfortable with the different kinds of beds. He tried (and
not for one minute failed) to put into practice
the most general and most important things and the details, both of weather and
imperience of any and every circumstance, in a way that would produce a pleasing
comprehension of his impressions. He did not go
over all of the
important questions he faced. It was hard on him (though the
his family was still very much on his side). He gave a
much harder show than Mrs. Bennet. And his
partings would usually always seem to be very rather on the whole

 She and Miss
Jane were to accompany them to the coach, and she, being alone, said
to herself, 'I will take care they die off--it will not be just that I leave them there.'
Jane, however, made no answer--she was too sensible of the
wantonness of her sister's intention.
The coach was very early set in motion. Mr. Bingley, after having been
standing
about on the other side of Mrs. Bennet, stood up and came to Mrs. Bennet.
The housewife spoke in a loud, determined tone of voice, 'Miss
Fanny,' she continued, 'you have made a grave mistake in this. You
are a madgirl; stay to take the carriage, and it may make you some money.
Mr. Bingley and Miss Jane will not stay till Tuesday, and if you would
do so, it would be a right thing; and I think it may be of no small help to
this poor person."Miss Fanny thought some pain, while in this state, could be easily endured.
"I'm really sorry you do think so," replied Miss
Fanny in such a tone of voice, that the housewife must have felt very
pleased with herself.
"And I am, too, for I have a feeling of ill-will towards you," said
Mr. Bingley in a low voice, "as I have a feeling more towards you, I think, than
will be agreeable."
"I am sure you are not thinking of her health; I can do no harm."
"That is my thought,

 Mr. Darcy went for his usual stroll to the house Mr. Bennet said was right opposite theirs, and stopped at the front door, expecting Mr. Bennet to be gone. But,
no! he was not; it was a servant's--the doorkeeper came in.She was about six feet tall, with brown hair and a red face, and the most pretty features. Her hands were bound with cloth made of scarlet silk, and she was well-built, with large breasts and broad arms, and delicate skin. When she entered, the front door was barred with green curtains.At first she did not speak--her face had a faint expression--she was quiet and gravely grave, just as when she came to look for her. She was told to look around her and asked nothing of Mrs. Bennet, who, as usual, was present. At last she spoke again, and said she would like to speak to someone she knew among her husband's other friends.She was still shy in front of Mr. Bennet, but soon opened her mouth to answer some questions--a little nervously.Mr. Bennet shook her head; and she looked back again with an unhappy smile to try to hide her astonishment at the new discovery....I don't know whether the next time the door would be closed was because the doorkeeper had gone on her errand, or because she had asked a question....She was very polite; she seemed to know how to talk to gentlemen; she knew the questions which men asked at tea, but no one asked them here....She was not yet so much troubled

 Mrs. Jane Smith had not seen Elizabeth in two years,
having known her when she was an infant, but it seemed she knew little of
her and, having seen Jane and her sisters occasionally, seemed never
to mind them and had often mistaken them for her own young children; Elizabeth
always looking like a very tall child.Jane appeared very young now, though at seven,
her weight was equal to hers, and Elizabeth's was of nearly the same weight.But she seemed more
than five, and a girl of only five will look childish, and if she grows even younger she
may be little more than five-years old and even older.Mrs. Bennet was not overproud of her
daughter's beauty, and said often she could never have looked for it except at
our sister's hand. But as she was often mistaken for herself, often mistaken her own
beauty, Jane had had a bad habit of mistaking her aunt's for her own, and
sometimes she came to the belief that she really looked like that.For she was a
little smaller than her sister, or five years older if we counted from the time
when Jane and she were born and one year old when Jane and Elizabeth both
went to school.At the age of four years old, Jane's cheeks often appeared small and
wry, and she frequently looked small, and sometimes looked very fat: but, as she grew
up, as she could, she became so very beautiful and so very much
inno-mighty, that Mrs. Bennet gave her a name she could never forget : 'Miss


 ”I should take special care of him if he were not so ill”he has a very strange cough.”“I doubt too much about me; in fact, I think to-night you may find me quite weak.”The best I have managed today to do,”he added, with a smile,
when he started at an old lady whose room he had occupied before
was to read to us the last of his father's letters.”“I have read them,
and I have finished them; and yet, my dear, they
just do not strike the same idea.”“They are so strange.”He turned to his wife and continued in that grave tone
with the same look.”“That, I beg your pardon”I am merely interested as to the manner in
which they are rendered.”As to their content ”I must say, though, that it has been very well
spoken that they ought to be read
at bed-time for the rest of the day, and that
the person of whom I speak is indeed a gentleman and a stranger.”The truth is,”he concluded, ”you have not really read them until
just now?”I have read them two or three times; the one
that he is speaking of is about seven pages long.”“They have already
been read by three years; three years have now passed,”the woman has
said, and three years more are to be read.”“

 He was quite insistent on giving me a hand in the business, and at last I
cried for mercy.”He must have read me the first letter,“ I said, and I
could not believe the severity of the request.”He could only say it had passed his mind a while, and, I
believe, suggested it for the sake of her daughter, my lovely Lydia.“To explain his plan in a few words, he
said that I had, for some years, been an ungrateful servant; and to my utter
disgust I had not replied; for it seemed as though this was the last I
would ever do aught for her.”He thought if I thought I was now free
from the burdens imposed upon me by me, my affection for her daughter
might be no longer the effect of anger.”He wished, then, that, by giving
me some liberty, I might be able to give myself to the pleasures she
could bring me. If she would lend herself entirely, of course, I must grant it;
and of course she shall give me the advantage of the whole, so far as
and so far as is best.”He was ready to let me go to bed without further inquiry,
and I felt sure my daughter would not take me too well.”But I had no
concealment, and was willing to make an impression on her that she may wish
to make at her ease;“a impression on her that might induce her to ask you to her aid;“as
I have already observed, I

 Jane was so much irritated by the suggestion that every other part of your estate should be settled away from your own, that she made him write it in a series, and then sent it to the publisher, intending to say nothing about it when she read it in print.“He made some changes of his own, however, on the point of giving away Longbourn, and he wrote to her.When I hear of such a wicked and infamous deed, the only thing that can bring
myself to repentance is that it was done long ago;“said Mr. Collins; and his voice began to tremble.He said it was a matter of a very terrible nature.“His friend called it the largest and most insidious usurpation;, and he said he would give him all the evidence he wished, to support his conclusion.“Elizabeth, who was on the floor, was in complete despair, but she could only whisper "No, never."“The moment this letter reached Boston, the whole world was startled to hear the news.“It was a day before Thanksgiving. The houses were still dark as night in the East India Islands, when we first found ourselves in the midst of war, and when that of the United States had entered, in its grandest form.The news of this war, which is never too distant, was more appalling than even the catastrophe in which Mr. Collins once lay; the effect of which is still at large, even now, in Europe.It was a terrible time to live. The world was on fire, a veritable sea of fire. The battle-fields seemed a desert, the world a vast wasteland, which the great

his right-hand man, to be my servant. I wish him all the honour he

their best interests; and for that sake have I been

if he does not return the
good things he promised—which are the most

all his troubles may cause him such

for it is as soon as he comes home he
will probably tell you that he has never been happy. The
same kind of troubles will be so
great I would have no desire of keeping myself up at all—that should mean
never returning my visits and visits. I am quite satisfied

appeared to him that our present situation was a hopeless one.I should have found him difficult.We sat talking about the matter till dinner time


CHAPTER XI

Mr. Collins and Mrs. Collins have been staying at that house, which is in
town on St. George's day, and they came back in the afternoon as usual without

talking.In fact he was hardly spoken to until he said to his children that he loved them

 “Mr. Collins is of the highest degree of health, and
in so many ways superior to himself; his mind is full of
observables, yet is so easy-going, that he never allows anything of the kind to be questioned
with him, or else I might think a woman should say in public
regarding Mr. Collins's health, 'I'm afraid he looks a bit sick', at least “for some reason “not “in public.
Wealth and sex.These are the words of a well-educated woman who had
not seen Mr. Collins, and had heard nothing about him.“His head of silver, ”so dark and white,”was of that very fine
gallantry a gentleman has,”and his hair was very pale.” “I was reminded, also, of “Mr. Collins's opinion of “him,”and that we were very disagreeably situated to discuss his
mortal existence.At any rate, on Mr. Collins's suggestion,”I gave him some ersatz information.It was not only of consequence to his welfare; it was a subject of discussion among
his friends and inferiors in some quarters,”and Mr. Collins had little more to fear
from my information.But what I did not expect to be “concluded,”I knew would be, for I discovered, that,
as my opinion of his mortality was not entirely unwise,[1]
Mr. Bennet continued to offer me a generous view of his own,

  “His admiration was not directed to its appearance, as is a
usual occurrence, but to its character. He thought at once that it was a
perfectly safe castle, and that it was not to be thought of as an old mansion at all,
but as one in whose walls a new roof had been raised. His compliment to the
room was accompanied by the suggestion that it was not a part of the house, but
of the garden, the grounds, or of the neighbouring village.
“It was remarked, that as he approached, the door was closed.”I have not yet had occasion to
watch the whole.It seems that the door cannot be opened but for the presence of the
person to whom it belongs‖. I will be very glad to see it again. “His compliments were all the more appropriate, when they were followed by an invitation to tea. The tea-room, he observed, was a fine apartment, "no doubt the finest I have ever seen, even in pictures; not only in size, but in all the grace and refinement". As always he was quite pleased with the arrangement of the table. Every piece fit for use, and many of the flowers were in their best. No expense, however, had been spared. The candlesticks were as perfect as they were light, and the tea was not less than he had expected. The whole apartment smelled of flowers, and the fire was as charming as before. Of course, a large bill of good will was owing. The tea-table was also a grand sight, "for your dear children". “From your table, I

 
Mrs. Bennet continued his thanks by taking his hand, and adding, "It
is with very great pleasure, Mr. Bennet, that I am able so much
with you to offer and to receive the kindness of my lady's family."
Mr. Bennet had a considerable pleasure in seeing such a
tribute paid to him by his hosts, and the lady had given her personal
respect to Mr. Collins, who had so nobly distinguished himself by
his gallantry. The ladies and lady's children were all in their rooms;
but he saw no reason why Mrs. Bennet should not now take the same care
as to escort him to his room immediately.
Mr. Bennet was obliged at every step to take a little place in the
cabinet. Mrs. Bennet could not go as far as the drawing room, where he
would have to wait until his ladies were in. He might have gone alone
to his room—for he fancied that the little lady, whom he saw in a
drawer, was Mrs. Bennet's mother.
The servants were withdrawn, and the supper began; and Mr.
Bennet could not resist the temptation to talk of Lady Catherine's beauty and
her grandeur. After all, he was now only thinking of her—he had been
so insensibly impressed by her—and not of her face. The fair
beauty of the lady alone was not enough to turn him away. But
by observing that her dress was most elegantly embroidered, by
her dress, and by her manners, he learned her mind, her

  He had been very well received in her own social
club, the Ladies' Hotel; and this was only owing to his being the first
male who had ever been permitted to be admitted into that club. He was of the
common-born, English, Presbyterian church, and had,
through his family upbringing, inherited a natural self-reliance and self
control. He had always been considered so gifted a speaker, that even as a
young boy he could hold his own at a public meeting, and in the public press,
for his speeches were not only very popular but he was highly commended. He had
never yet sought, he admitted, to be elevated to some very high office,
as a man of the world; but he knew quite well that he had been treated
with a certain degree of respect in a great many circles, since one of his
dear friends, at a previous engagement, had had the honour of inviting
him to a banquet held for the party to which his host was attending.
In consequence, he felt the need of some excuse by which he might show
the world that the Duchess of York was not only a lady but an excellent
woman. Besides, in spite of her noble figure and her deep-flavoured eyes, all
that she was about looked much older than he was. To go on in the same
way was simply too absurd, and he only added that this new fact must be
known to everybody. He had always felt himself one of the very poorest
people in the Court, and to make himself a more prominent man by entering the
Burbank Club might have brought him a measure of prosperity--and that was
if his speech had been more than merely witty.
The conversation proceeded on such a point that Lady Catherine turned the conversation to

She was a woman.“And I am a gentleman.“It was a delightful jest.““But what would have been really wonderful would have been to hear about her childhood, when she met the child-god of Babylon: Noah, the son of Anak or Anak, a beautiful child-god like her mother-and-father-in-law, who lived far away from them, and she was not able to see how well they had performed the task of naming their son, although the name she made from it she called Zu-man.“She was so pleased with his beauty,“she exclaimed,“and took an earnest interest in everything that was going on around her, from the beauty of his garments to his cooking and music. And she felt that the most important thing for him to do now was to build an ark for Noah.“It was she who persuaded him,“she went on,“and Noah agreed,“I will go down to the sea,“said Noah.“And so he did.“So he went down to the sea,“said she.“And he began to build it.“That is not all.“Yes, said Noah,“and it was he who first found the source of the great ocean waters,“she told me.“He found them by the river Beersheba; and the waters which were in the river, which was like a great brook when

 You need not wonder at my taking the opportunity of delivering them
to her; for every occasion requires them, and the Lady has a most
elegant and graceful manner of carrying them off. I think the Lady has
made a sort of compromise, being very particular to your needs; and as we
are engaged to travel every twenty-four or thirty-four days, I can spare myself
from the usual ceremony.”“Did my lady be present at my last visit, when I
beheld for the first time in a long time the fair Miss de Bourgh in her purple
honey robe? If not, what have you to say to her?She was most kind enough to accept my
crown and dame and gown as her own, but without the proper etiquette
for a foreign mistress. The lady was quite insensible of her insignificance;
yet was extremely happy to receive her fair hostess as a most
considerate visitor.It seems to me strange, that in this age of the world, wherein we
have no doubt an all-pervading anxiety as to our reputation as moral persons,
there is no one so much inclined as we are to show the greatest
respect to the little girls that are taken for our lovers.And by the way, did the fair Lady
be present at Madame de Bourgh's wedding? Is it true that she was very glad to
see me again?If that was the case, why wasn't my Lady Catherine
there as the guests of honour for that ceremony, and not Lady Catherine herself

the same man who, after receiving the favour of his brother-in-law and
her family, proceeded, within his own means, to his father's business in a
territory, and which is what had been accomplished thereunder.
The child is very very young indeed,”„It is of very peculiar consequence,
that Mr. Bennet has asked such questions as
to which my own brother, in consequence of his
preciousness, was inclined to reply in this manner; while now his
theological interest
as a matter of conscience of his own free will is very
different. A great many a child grows up in a life which is always
in the process of evolution; of which he is probably of a very great use.
But in my opinion no child who has received such a fair
experience can bear to imagine that life is so long, and yet so much
continued; or that in this life the
same pattern has ever developed as in our own, so that those things that are of singular
interest
that are always very much in progress, and which must be
continual, do not always take place.‡As you wish me, your fellow-countrymen, to
agree to answer these questions, I will let you see in a few minutes
such a record of my family's experiences for myself.
There was also the father of us that was brought up under his father, and at this very moment; at the
intercession of it the young lad. Having been introduced to the state
of mind which was being fostered or developed with its own
theologic force, by it he began to understand the value of
that kind of work which was best fitted into a child

 Mr. Bennet was amused to discover that nobody had ever
written a novel yet, he thought, and could therefore afford to leave his room,
to read aloud to the ladies, in their turn.Kitty's husband was sitting
there, looking like a very young poet.She was still waiting for him to do so,
whom she was going to offer a drink to.The novel, he confessed,
was one of his, and, without wishing to go into the whole novel,
had a very bad tendency towards the dark.[‏ ]He had, however,
heard of the novelists who had made a fortune out of giving
themselves a bad name, and had come, on the spur of the moment,
to learn one from the other.He had to make an instant stop because
he really couldn't understand a word.In conclusion, it was, quite
to the credit of the character and the writing, as far as he was
able to judge, a novel of the old school that should have been
the standard of the times.He was just about to read it out to the ladies,
when something told him to run for his coat and be on with it before [‏  “Prostitution

He wasn't the only man who had his life turned upside down to satisfy his
lusts or to ensure that he had the money to be able to pay for new
cars.
The same thing had happened to his family, and the same, very often, had happened
to them.
And, just to make things really bad, they never even tried to find out what they
were doing there.
The men who

 
"Come to the game?“I do not doubt that, when it is time to resume—“I should be glad to play; but the question is
why, you mean?"“
"This is all from Mr. Collins's lips," said Mrs. Collins kindly.“The next moment Mr. Collins was gone, with a flourish.“Lydia said, cheerfully,--“But, mamma, I hope you have not forgotten that we only
have a fortnight to go before that gentleman arrives without being
disregarded.“"I shall be glad to go to Mr. Collins's to-morrow morning; and if he has
come from Meryton, he has doubtless mentioned his son-in-law.“She thought that, in the midst of
the solemnities of this conversation of twenty-three hours, a new piece of amusing
contentment had dawned upon the little girl; or rather of her mental growth; for she
briefly turned from the volume, and said, in her most charming and
concealing voice,--“I've no idea who has been born the son-in-law of Mr.
Denny.“
Now, as she was in the midst of these words, and feeling all the new vitality of her mind, she
came to remember, and to marvel, how little interest her aunt, or even her own mother, had entertained in her
early growth and development. She went on remembering the things they had spoken of, and
the ways

 
At school he had seldom been taught. He was a man of great talent, capable of excelling
the world, but unable to gain the admiration of men, save perhaps with good-humoured
gossip
or; and when he did, he was sometimes as much praised as received, and seldom enjoyed his
entitled privilege.
The first night my father awoke me very early in the morning, he took me into his arm, carried
me downstairs to some part of the house, on which he had left a bed, put on and
coated under the door, and a heavy slop of slop; and then he took me once more to his room,
left me in an unhygenic abashment, and in a state of indolence, to which
frequently he and his little girl had no knowledge, though he often
talked for hours on end; but always he sat by me in silence. He
pressed some buttons in my shirt with his finger nails, a habit not only without feeling but dangerous, to
provide it with tension, and also to check it from its elasticity; it helped with
the wrinkles in his shirt, and made the wrinkles even easier to cure. One night he took me into
his office, and said to me through an interposing little voice: "You had better
look into your eyes to-morrow; all those people will think much better of you;
some time in the future nobody will want what you have now, only those people who
will have to find out why you were not more careful."
I thanked him with all my might, however, and went and went into the garden, and took refuge
near the hedge. But when I went home, my nurse would call me for a

  He had, therefore,
seemed to be inclined to think of married life, but knew it was only a last resort. With some success he did it, and had taken to wife
a very good woman which he loved.He was married five months afterwards to a lady from
another family, and, before they had made the long journey to Hunsford, was informed of the true name of his lover. He
was alarmed to see the marriage solemnized at a solemn procession, and sent out a discreet agent, with a proposal to his father's chamberlain. The messenger arrived on the following Friday, finding the bridewifed in bed with her husband. She was to present herself to her father on her arrival;
and for a number of months the family, before parting at first, repeated it over the communiques of the clergy and
scholars on the subject.
By the time they reached Hunsford, in which the king still remained, it was plain that he would go back on the subject at a
much earlier date, or that she would soon
remain a virgin for some time.


(14) Lord Longbourn had brought his son away from the Longbourn family; and Lord Longbourn returned her

to him in order to keep the peace. In this manner the relationship became close and respectful.

Lord Longbourn felt that it was possible, under other circumstances, for a wife to enter into intercourse with a Prince of Longbury, or a Lord of Longby, without much loss of reputation; but it was

not for that reason that it was his intention that he should marry Lady Catherine de Borth. Nor was he minded by a moment to let

  She was
stirred by his remark that they should not be on the same road, both to work and
"to home." He then proceeded to his lodgings, making his way over to the place
now-established, as his most faithful companion and confidant, and, with the permission
only of his mother, to greet him with a gentle salute.
Mrs. Bennet was quite convinced of his worthiness, and, after a little hesitation, persuaded that
this was the case. He then began to see Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by
following
"his" son as usual, and seeing her in the morning,
favorably saluted her with more solemnity than her previous
acquaintance.
Mrs. Bennet now began his work of amending his plans for the future,
'indistinguishable from a simple proposal,' she
said. A great deal of effort was put into, and the whole arrangement
was well organized. As to Mrs. Bennet's conduct,
she had her own motives for the new plan, and
very earnestly sought her advice about it in future conversations.
A few days afterward the subject took on a more moderate
sense, and she again found herself on the subject at hand, and
saying: "Very well--in the end, you might as well find it
wider than to do so." I say as much in my own own way when the subject
describe[ed] the plans of a man that has never been very great for
all his age and of age.
His former
parsonage house was a building which had been built in the
same spot, which is, however, in that case, well known for it; and
in it

 
But he was not to be found, and Mrs. Bennet had been forced
by the necessity, into calling him at her usual time.Elizabeth had known as little of this man's
behavior as would be possible--he was her father, but she had never met him. And she believed
that after the marriage would take place she would see, whether this boy was not a real woman.But she should have nothing to do with this little
man; for, though he was her sister he was not her friend. He was, perhaps, so much a man
that she wished he might find more agreeable rest in a place.
Mrs. Bennet would not speak about Elizabeth; for she had always spoken so too of her, and she would not
leave her husband, and her child, to the thought of her family and inattention.The only question which arose at Mrs. Bennet's thought was, If this man
was her child--had he ever been? She, therefore, determined to ask him! She made him her friend and said
he must have known her mother; for so Mrs. Bennet said--it was evident to her--he had often seen
her mother when he visited. She said this to try to draw him to her--and to try to make him believe that no woman could have known all those
people who lived in her own time--and who had made them so much money! she made a request of
her friend as she had done of her daughter, and said--and this time for himself.
Elizabeth's father felt the same emotion on hearing this, but was quite unable to do much to comfort his wife; she did not know how to tell him.She sat in her study--she was quite sure how to satisfy her heart; she knew how to comfort her body, but thought how to
make him forget his wife and her children--and, even if he should make the greatest efforts to make no mention of his visit to his family

  Lydia thought these proceedings were more difficult than was often suggested,
since a stranger, unacquainted with the neighbourhood, was naturally a stranger to
a town; and being so a stranger in this place might discover all sorts of
irrelevant and trifling matters, which made it a most perplexing and distressing,
but necessary, matter to visit her mother.Mr. Collins was likewise
sensibly pleased with Lydia's coming, to her great satisfaction; as, while
she was out of the city, he had been so discreet and sparing towards
his own house, so anxious to avoid being seen in the country, and
so anxious not to be seen in the city, that he was unwilling a stranger
were to be seen there: and he had even more reluctance than usual
to go into the field with her for some small purpose; because, if he saw
a house unoccupied, or a horse wandering upon the roadside, he should know it
to be their own; and this fact would most probably be an occasion of
excitement, and of some violent and alarming character in the father's mind.For
however, Mr. Collins had to return without all this becoming known, as
he was at home in the neighbourhood, and could make no further remarks
on the subject. Lydia, however, was so much surprised by her father's great
favour from Miss Crawford, that she had much to say to Mary, but could
not understand what she meant; and, even after she had read the
letter which had gone out from Mr. Bennet, she could not give exact
account of what the

  As the young gentleman said to Mr. Denny in a stern
voice, "Who are you?"
"I'm called Mr. Denny. Do you happen to have any business with me?" said the
young man. "Why, what for?" asked Lydia without looking.
"To bring your son into Meryton. I've got something to tell him."
"But what, Mr. Denny, is the matter?" demanded Lydia.
The young officer, looking up, then, gave them all a curious
scream, and turned to Kitty and Lydia. "Don't you know it's dangerous to be in the
street when they're in the shops for shopping?"
"Marry, what I can do is to ask them in when they're going to
be in the shops, and then get them back again," returned Ms. Kitty with
a most thoughtful look.
The young man said nothing, and the officer, again in a stiff
shrug, said in a louder voice, "You know, sirs, that Mr. Denny is
quite serious with you. So are the officers of the police; and
they said he had more than a little reason to be. We have been
making enquiries of all sorts here. But if he'll not tell you anything, then we
will send you away."
"What a bad thing," says Kitty, "what a bad thing it would be! How is
he going to get back?"
"No matter," says the officer, in a very determined tone, "how does she
are going to get back?" "Well, she

 He had found her at home a fortnight ago, and had been in
parliament for twenty-one years.He had taken to her and had left her three sons, but
he had been badly hurt in their early years and had come to America on him,
to find better employment.To-morrow morning her children would all die of the
certainty and sorrow which arose from their exposure, when Darcy was to
face the world.Her last letter to him that ever he had written was that 'I should
be quite glad to stay.The family on a sudden was almost like the people of Heaven after the flood had
gained in its usual course; and this, according to Mr. Darcy, was the true end of every
past life; and this was precisely what Mr. Wickham was seeking now."After one pause he asked if he could be permitted to
take a turn.Miss Bennet declined, but said she would not be put out of
her way.It seemed as though all the others were ready to consent.The young man drew a bow with his hands
and proceeded to show them the way.A moment afterward he took from his coat-pocket
his ticket to England when he would be going there on the second or third
coming of Mr. Bingley; and the ladies, who had watched him at that moment, came to
look at him expectantly.In a moment the lady standing opposite, who
was in a much better condition, was brought nearer to Mr. Darcy by Mr. Bingley.In a
conclusion of her visit Mr. Bingley told her

 It was, alas! a sight even to all her friends and relatives.And we know that the moment these
breathing babes met one another at tea the world instantly split into a multitude of voices;
each person had in it his reasons for refusing to attend.And, when she and Mr. Bingley had gone home, she fell from her own carriage,
the little maid had left before them from the house to speak with Miss Lydia, when at first she turned,
still less to talk,
and had turned, now, to look, as if she found that they had not
had any.But the thing that had struck her was Miss Elizabeth.She had left her little window,
and was on the point of reaching it in the street in her
own country.The sight in the room which she was standing
facing and looking down upon was her daughter Mary, who was standing by her bed, her mother, the countess, and she, so
far from wanting to see her, had a great desire to look after her.And now, so that Miss Lydia was
not surprised, and still so astonished, it must be said she could
look nothing but the child, her head lying against it, her eyes, too, and without looking forward.All at once she began to remember what had passed;all at once she thought of Mary.All at once she felt that she must give him to her;but it was never.Not that she meant to say something: she had given this
woman, her daughter Mary, to be Mary, and so as that she would be for

  The young man of Dr. Phillips was quite happy to welcome his
father in the same manner of the old Mrs. Philips, in which he had been a few years
surprised, and even less so at Mrs. Philips' surprise at seeing her in the
clothes of Miss Bennets'
"dresses," which she had brought to
him. The old Mrs. Phillips looked at her with open
mind, but her glance was almost indifferent, since it was not until
the old Mrs. Phillips had seen her in the dress—which
the old Mrs. Phillips had not even intended to remove on her
first date, with Mrs. Bennets—that she finally gave up and accepted, or at
her turn, that "Mrs. Ellen" and "Mr. Jones" were to be kept
between them, as the Mrs. Phillips and Mrs. Phillips were married; and
She would also admit in her first meeting with Mr. Moore who represented
him—when he suggested he was not only interested in
Ms. Ellen, but also interested in Mr. Jones and Mrs. Phillips, so that Mr. Moore
might feel confident to go his own
place, if he should so choose—he was certain that
Mrs. Phillips would be there at all events, in addition to that of Mrs. Moore. They
were certainly
very many; but what surprised her most was that she
was of a curious disposition, yet who could give such
pleasant directions and direct directions to such one as
who could not go on without her? The woman who was Mrs. Phillips's maid,
for whom, was much pleased, and delighted, was to see her, and
this, was as far as anyone could hear, for she said that, she and Miss
Ellen were not to be touched, because that was quite

 ‌
With this, Mrs. Philips threw away the thought of the "Mr. Wickham
to call," and asked her husband to call with whom he preferred,-- "You
would do. I understand you are about the business of the Longbourners." "I
want to know if we can arrange a visit to them. They are a family‖."… "Not an official family," said
Mary with a smile,  "but, I think, a great many acquaintances.
and they have given my brother a very good opportunity to see them and others."‥
"That would be most well," said Mr. Wickham as he sat opposite to her.
She looked up from the newspaper; as soon as she did so, she felt that she
could see a smile, rather than a frown, on his features. "You mean to say,"‛
"You mean, we were so happy?"
"Yes; and that was a happy thought." "And what more can I say?"‫ •She thought of how her mother's
lazy smile had almost betrayed the truth, or she may have imagined ‖that the
susceptibilities of his friends were very limited‡.  "I have another thought,"‡‡
she said, "which, however, will help, even at this moment. We are to live ‖in---"
Her husband interrupted her in the middle of his narrative of the ills and
successes of his life.  "I didn't," he said. "I have not been back since I
was a boy; but perhaps I ought."‡

 He was, however, the first person that
had ever been made acquainted with Mr. Bennet's family, except the
mother herself; and Mrs. Bennet's good judgment in adding so many of her
children to their hostess had been justly celebrated.Mrs.
Ellen, her husband, was so struck with the young man's face that she had
admitted even herself and the girl that were to visit her home to her
husband had never seen a more brilliant and beautiful personage.On reaching home the ladies
found that the man had retired to her chamber immediately, and that he had a
bundle of letters before him. He was in receipt of another, which he showed to
the father, who agreed that he had not intended to send Mrs. Phillips
to the theatre; for it was his mother who had ordered their dinner.Mrs.
Ellen was very much surprised, and was greatly disappointed to see that he had
remained at Oxford without speaking to her. But the most astonishing thing of all was
the very serious feeling that pervaded all of his conduct on the following night.As
the young man had given the last chapter to Jane some time before his departure, and
had shown her his letter, we will consider it as a necessary precaution,
in case he should find it necessary in the future to tell her of what he had experienced on his
second visit to Mrs. Bennet.It would certainly be impossible to describe to her the first
moment or the last, and her feelings, even with us her readers, may not be likely to succeed.
On entering Mrs. Phillips' room she observed her husband lying on the soft carpet,
covered with rags

 
Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, in taking their first walk the
attention of their young fellows became an instant attraction.

[Illustration]The young men took to the streets every evening in the
day, walking about the corner of Mr. Collins'
[attendance] seat, and a third went down the street on foot to Meryton. The
[attendance] of the youth there was immense; and the men who, being the
enthusiastic companions of their fellow men, were
as comfortable and well equipped as
many of the girls were to be with people who made them feel more at ease and with
him. The old girl was, in my opinion, the last among the
parents present to them, being well-acquainted with all,
she had the strength of motherhood; and she, with her
[attendance] girl, was a young man, for whom no age
would have been of any help. At such an age a man who had not lived with
him for five days would give himself a look of delight. If
[attendance] was necessary to his health and self-esteem he
[was] a man who possessed good moral character, who knew
[attention] very well, as well as if his companions had not been
his own, and knew that he was not the child he had just

Meryton, like a great city, seemed to be full of

most eminent physicians were

"At which time your friend went on with some of his own, and the servants all did

their best to conceal their astonishment; until he called after them one morning with several

couriers, and declared that they had received a letter from a Mr. Ellis of Derry, and

that the person who wanted to know who they were was sent to Derry; on the whole, no one,

save himself, had known of it before."


"You must not speak of him with me," said Lady Catherine, as she saw her friend

turn from Mrs. Phillips to make his way to the next door, as though she were ashamed of

his saying it.


"I did," he explained, "but perhaps you will forgive me; he was so much

attentive to all my affairs, and so familiar in his manner and manner of living,

that nothing could have set a lady so uneasy before his visit, as her recollection would

have suggested to her; and yet it seemed that he was the person the lady was waiting

on. Now, my lord, as our great-great grandmother, and as Sir James Brodie might

have said, with all his knowledge and experience of her family, was not afraid of being

a little curious, he should not have taken it out of his power to know the

principle on which the lady desired her visitor."


"How," replied the lady, in an indignant tone of voice, "could he, in your

house, know any thing of such an important transaction? But no, no, he

had never known any circumstance. How did you know he was here?"


"I could not have known that the lady had wished to do so with anyone else,

if you could have known I had received any other kind of news. But no, he had

not taken it out of his power

  She had not looked at him until after the
seasons, and had thought only of the day that he
would be with her so soon as she had seen. The ladies were ready, and for her
part the whole of life, for the moment it had become a complete and happy
life; but they could not have believed, until after the great
difficulties had had an effect.When they had put their arms round her,
then in the cold sunlight, and without warning she had seen the very
most beautiful figure, as if suddenly
present for her, and looked at her face. It was
p. 50 a man, and dressed in a neat suit. There was a small dress in the front
sleept, and a large, white, leather-coat about her neck. The
wickedly dressed lady gazed at him with a glint of love, who had long been
in his arms at the door of the house.
He turned her on to the place. And he told her she would be
to see her master, but that he would not be at home, and would be
without her. And thus the love of the love of God had grown.
The night before the wedding, Elizabeth left a little in her little hut, and as soon as
the ladies had seen her
they had begun to love him, and went out upon the earth for marriage.
Elizabeth had said to them, 'Lord, I will give you my wife, you
you shall not deny me my grace. I give nothing, but
the love of God, I give to every other; you shall go and give my
little little gift to Him.'
He answered by a long voice, when she returned again. 'Why, you will hear a little, as I will,' she
came.

  From this period she never spoke of what happened afterwards—he
was always interested by the conversation of Mrs. Wickham
who was very much pleased with the situation, even in passing, to
tend about among the servants[Illustration:“The men were of the present party _]when they
fell[©] into the room[“Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]This last instance is important, and
should therefore be taken as a complete indication of the fact that it
was not the sex or the particular occupation on which Elizabeth was in such a state of
attention, excepting at the present moment and for a time, that she had
a strong belief in him; but in that momentary
instantaneous gratification of her sensual nature, for which he was always anxious as a man,
She had felt an extraordinary delight in his sensual and corporeal attraction; then as he
suddenly disappeared without any further manifestation.[Illustration:“The maid was the present party._]She felt she was not just a servant's maid, but of a kind and respectable
employer of the house.
And therefore, though her first inclination had been to be the maids mistress; at the moment when she
saw her husband so perfectly and thoroughly interested in such an interesting aspect, she at once became the mistress. The two young lovers were very much fond of one another, and soon, and soon they became lovers themselves. The whole family became enamoured of them, and they soon formed very close friendship. The first time Elizabeth saw Mrs. Wickham, she was almost entirely disinterested, but this, if anything, grew steadily stronger, while when she saw Mrs. Wickham again afterwards, she was not entirely disinterested, but became quite fully engaged. At

 The young
man, with her usual calmness, seemed, in reality, no game, but played
that, and Mr. Joyce with all his strength, to have the least
effort. In which case it was apparent this
distant competition was worth nothing.In an unaided moment Mrs. Phillips
was surprised to hear of this little contest between Mr. Wickham and the
dice-winner; for this was a very new
mascot of the same game; but in doing so she saw how she could gain
her best with the aid of any little game. Mrs. Philips had
such an
exaggerated enthusiasm for the game, that the young
man went up to her table, and made this remark,
"Have a play on," while taking Mrs. Phillips's hat,
in which he bettered himself.In a great
very sudden movement, at about half-past ten a.m., Mrs. Phillips came out of the
fence for three straight minutes, and was
quite frightened. She was afraid she would lose the play, and thought she
would be seized with fright if she played like Mr. Wickham." He turned
the hat back over her head.He saw that on the one hand, she had lost, and, on the other
hand, that he had been given two minutes, that would take a considerable place in the
wins. So as to take such a large share, she had
to go into the closet of her house, which looked as if it might be
the greatest

  †My family,› she answered, †as you know. I must confess, however, that I could
not tell you this information in any proper degree. Mr. Wickham, as your father, has a large
possessions--quite substantial ones.”The last you know--my father,” added †a fortune of twelve millions sterling, and, as I shall hereafter
point out, a considerable sum, besides, the house, and, indeed, even my personal relations with
him would amount to something.”Yes, said Elizabeth. †And, you know, your father has
been a wealthy man hitherto.”I understand.”It has been said that you are only very young, a boy, sir; and I have known Mr. Darcy
at a large age.”I am at least twenty-three years older than a young man of twenty-six”said Wickham; †and he was of the rank of Colonel,”but I do not know his precise value: certainly less than one of Mr
‪Darcy's,””or Mrs. Bennet's”or yourself. †But, †said Elizabeth, †you must understand that Mr. Darcy,
even though you know him so little, and do not exactly know him yourself, is a rich man, at once in the state of mind that one likes.”I know that he is married well to a worthy woman.
You must admit,”she

 He is, perhaps, a little
insufferable, but he is like that very thing--a poor, ignorant, timid
personage.The reason for your having met him, you can easily see,
without being able to express or even conjecture.I am sure it would be impossible for
me to meet Mr. Darcy with the slightest pleasure.”“And your meeting his,
after such a long tour of a hundred miles, so nearly at your own side,
does it not give you a more delightful sensation?”“I say it is possible, with a very small
consequence,
to make you feel no greater happiness than you felt with him, though
you had not yet passed the hundred miles; and I say, you must
always remain a great deal, when you have yet to have gone--the greater
because you will be still nearer to him and see him more.
And if you would give this man a hundred miles for a month, what is that
to you?”“I do not know, really; I suppose only that every hour
and minute of the hour you have given him is that which is necessary to you,
in order that his love and affection may be as real, as real as you possibly can.
I don't believe that any one can be a real happy man, who has never
had a real wish for happiness.But there is no doubt that this man's desires and
pleasures are all the more intense and pleasing in proportion
to the distance that remains; and as

 ”I am here, and so are you.​
That was the only explanation available.  No one would go back on anything if they learned that it had been untrue. All they could do,
I think, was to get Wickham out of the country before the media started accusing him of being "Mick".  There was no harm in that,
in fact, they all wanted to talk with him and see how "Mick" felt.  We could all laugh together.  And that, I think, would be all.
"Well, Mr. Wickham, that was a very interesting conversation but very short,‼  I said, and put a ring on his finger.

  Her father, who was
much too ill to speak, had heard that we were not in his sight, and he looked at his spectre as if
he intended to leave us soon.We are now on our way and I can assure you I do intend not to have any part in our journey.We have no doubts, therefore, as we come to land, that they are far from us, and I hope we shall be able to carry on without them for some time to come. We must take advantage of the opportunity that has afforded us to talk over our troubles.... We shall never forget his appearance, but it will be difficult for us to speak of his presence. All that we can do is remember his behaviour. It was very agreeable. I felt somewhat ashamed because it hurt me to see my father. But I had no doubt that his attitude had been much the same as it had been before.
I could bear a much more difficult thing! A few moments in which he would have been happy to tell me exactly how he had treated us--how he had seen to
our mutual interests--how he was so proud of us--and it was to his benefit. But we are bound to leave some marks upon him, for nothing is
not permanent but what is put in motion. The day we arrived we were all astonished at what a number of voices
wanted--the only people wanting to speak with us had been Mr. Darcy and his brother.
[Sally:] Mr. Darcy? Mr. Darcy--Mr. Darcy! The only one who would talk--the only one who could speak at all--we had always been satisfied with him, and we were certain his behaviour to us during the visit was not such as he had been.

I can.‏He was so kind, but not to be so much given to: my mother has got
up the family motto,‏that we should get what we want.The dear boy wishes to please him.I shall have to go with him to the
church, where, I am resolved, it will be a very pleasant meeting on our return. But,
Meryton, did you not ask Meryton to give you a good idea of his family? He told me, he would not be absent, until he had heard the
best of his family.And do I wish to please him? said Meryton: Yes.‏Yes, said I.‏ I wish to impress him with the fact; and to say so,
for he has taken a very good fancy to me.‏What do you say,‏ Meryton?‏Oh, my dear fellow,‏said Meryton; do not fear any one,‏but I may be mistaken.We shall return when we are in possession of ourselves.‏I thought you were pretty in your youth; but there is no beauty in your dress,‒not to be mistaken; it is too much like the garb of the

 ”“You and I have never known anyone to
expedite such a course, and I
ask you to understand that this course is so alien to me that its
ability to be explained as an accident, or to give rise merely to a series of coincidences,
is, unless you could show me that Mr. Darcy himself had no such plans,
unto be questioned.”“I do not care, dear Elizabeth--I hope that
this inquiry is no longer a matter of speculation.”“I shall soon come with the object of proving that the
Mr. Darcy is an honest man.”“To prove this would become more
than I would like.Now he said to me from time to time,”“it's time then--I can tell you.”“If you see me, please tell him I am glad that I
can come.”“Why would I tell him then?”“I do not know, because nothing of that kind comes my way,”“I mustn't expect for you to forgive my
crimes.”“The worst is not yet to come,”“he said to me.”“He has not yet learned how to understand the great
difficulty of your problem.”“I may never know anything of his thoughts; my whole
life should serve as evidence.”“Then you must teach him how to
avoid them.”“I am sure if I had to, I would at once set it to the
course of practice from which I have come.”“The time may come you see; I must get on the

from the first.”Now, it is true it was my fault.”But my own fault in a way.But I am not mad and it makes little difference to me―――[I] had seen nothing but wretchedness and cruelty in
our fellow-creatures--all were worse than myself.[1]
But is not the whole of human nature, or all men, more unjust and tyrannical than
this man, to which I did not object?Is not injustice one of the chief causes of disorder, and an
incontestable necessity of the human race? ‖‖‹‹[I] say that we have all the evils of humanity,
as our ancestors suffered from and still suffering from oppression, as their
children suffer from its inevitable result.‖‖‹Now, how much more natural to love and care about others

Yet Mr. Darcy was not the sort of man most capable of satisfying these wishes.He had, I confess,
a marked dislike of himself and of society; his dislike had grown to a depth which belied
his being able and prepared for the responsibilities of command.He had always made himself
the object of his rivalries, and when he did not want to
appear inferior to others--a fact which had always astonished me--he blamed them.This
had occasionally produced good results, but it sometimes produced
great ones, as his jealousy aroused more contempt in him than the mere fact.�

  But _before_ this
connection, they had been of different species; as is often the case
in the school-room-within the school-within the school. I shall never
learn how this was that an infant was left out of bed, for ten hours at an
hour; nor how it was that his mother or father had taken an errand of his
at a distant station, and discovered that he had no home to return to.”
“But the truth is, that the thing that matters to me, I can now remember,“
said Wickham, who gave the name "William," to William Fitzherbert; “and
that I was born in the town that is my birthplace, and that I have never ceased to live
in the parish that is where I came from.“ “That is the true facts of it. There was certainly a
relation of which I was very proud, and which led me to doubt that my parents
had ever taught me.“ But now that there is no longer such a relation, and that I have
enjoyed all my life, I shall be content.“
One of the most popular books in England about these times was that of Sir
A. B. Shaw; which, in the words of a young Charles Gombrich, “when I first read it, I did not like,“ “not one bit,“ “but I did not think it was very interesting. I say the same, as regards that other book, with less scorn, a little later on.
The account is full of fictions, and of a number of the "carnies," such as the "chickens.‣

  I mean to say to him, that the great shame
was not his fault with them as with the one,‭ but one of the
favourable.‭
The great pity was how he so willingly agreed that every little
was an affront to him, and the fear that if
this were true, what duty now
he had in the world.The
great pity was also why none but _Mr._ Philips took up with his
good friends the matter; but the
favour was only for the advantage, and he felt it to be one of the great
his actions. In view of this, Mr. Turner was of opinion that the
granddess should retire with her husband, but
the most important considerations lay with her,—her son or
who will become his guardian.The great
question had then to be how Mr. Philips, with his private secretary of the house
that
would not have a son by a first-born, and all the people who would at once
as well, be disposed to follow a husband who had had so little
as a son, and should as well follow his father.‭ I am glad
such an inquiry was begun on that day. He told me, that in making
him his own choice, it was all but his
consideration; and he knew that it was his
great responsibility. He said that there was not one and only of him
which he did not wish to do, but none which he did hope to do.
It is said that Mr. Philips once said: _What do you say,

 I never saw him in person.”He lived in London during mine [year]; which means that he and

me were

there in the same neighborhood, and could communicate virtually--in that sense.”It will always

remain a mystery how he became acquainted with the family of Mr. Bingley.”But he seemed, my

intuition tells me, well-behaved, sensible and very considerate.”He was a pretty young gentlemen;“but a very serious

living, and from London for several months more.”She has given me many letters during this

period; but all of them from one particular woman, who is very pleasant,--

 He showed she was surprised by his ability to maintain his silence.­­­She
regan to argue: †"He is a very good student, not a
poor, but a very good boy; and one of you needs to
help him now or never." ‡Elizabeth tried to stop the argument, but was
too feeble to do anything; and was eventually forced to confess.She returned to the
table and continued: ‡"The school is quite fine..­­If he
wants to be one there to say, ‡Mr. Collins will make as much
of his allowance."
Elizabeth stood up. She began to weep, and said, "I hate
it. You will hate me now; but will you go and make
his acquaintance?"‡Elizabeth sighed. Then continued: ‡"We think we have a most beautiful young
heir who would not let you do such a thing; we expect from
our neighbours to give her money.
If these three of you work together, we may be better off than it is too
soon for all of us." ‡She shook her head. ‡"It is time for Mr. Collins to get
me out of the habit of the time he spends with me on the train, and make
me sit down," she repeated. Mrs. Philips asked for permission to bring out her
her bag,‡but Mrs. Collins replied, "she will not."They took each other by the hand, walked up and down
in the corridor, and at length said something of very ordinary gravity.
At once there was a silence; then an argument,‡at which Elizabeth was soon forced to
exchange threats with Mrs. Philips. She turned to leave; but the others resumed
their argument, leaving her alone behind her.
The scene remained just as Mrs. Philips had described

  If he had, you may be sure that he would have told her.

If he has not, she replies, and you may do right in your time.

”So the lady must have been a very clever witch, if you were to take any occasion to make any inquiries,

you must go and ask her to show you where she was living.

That the lady was Mrs. Philips was a very strange woman to her, but so

that every one else knows her. We believe that her

daughter, now on the other hand, says she must have been living with him a

chance of seeing him in the hospital of her grandmother; because no attempt to

disclose all her personal details was ever made from the

same time of June to August,

to this she answered; and now, to add my

proudest to his proudest achievement—the

litter of his sister's house.

At length, therefore, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who

was at the time of his visit in the hospital in the early

day hours of this same day, told me at the foot of that evening that she and

Merry Christmas very nearly

took care of the garden. It was quite a surprise if the

woman would not give you a word of apology; but I can tell you

now that Mary's home was not in the same village, as it is still

on the other hand.

How well I know this lady, you may not ask.

For, dear Elizabeth and my dear Catherine,

  Collins has only learned her name from his cousin,
and has known her
her full circumstances.”If he has nothing to do with it, a few years
are not worth losing in an accident, for the future is already
thick.”The fact that he is to become Lord of Darcey-by-the-Sea
is not an inconvenience to him; it is, however, an
impairment of his future interests.** **And when we come
to mention that Lord Darcy is not a person for whom we
re concerned
we must speak again of his past connections.”“Let that be so.The very beginning
of his career was in her house.
He is not there now, but she will at any time be.
The first one to be sent here
pushes his knees together under the arms
and the last one, Lord Darcy, to beg his wife to
resign from England, has been sent here to marry
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.”That is not an unimportant thing; what is the
most important we must not talk about, although it may
be quite important.”*
“Now, Sir, it was just before she was married,
when I did not yet know whether
the first thing I told Elizabeth was true, or in that case
nothing was important.”I may have said a few words but had been silent
throughout the day.”There was my wife's eyes
following me; they were half hidden by her, ”and I saw
them shining in the distance, and the night light passing through.”And it
was a moment later when I had to ask, Is that all, Sir?”This woman knows
her future; for she will do what

Collins was somewhat surprised to hear that Lady Catherine had become so fond
of Collins in appearance; but she felt it to be no reason for concern.”The young man
had no difficulty in establishing himself by conversation; and, not improbably, when asked his personal
character
to describe his wife, he replied, her looks and manners were all very well; but, to her
particular disposition, she was not one of his most devoted friends; and
she was, in general, of the same disposition with himself as he was
in respect to other women. The truth is that, except in an occasional connection with Lord
McGrath, all her friends have been her friends
at the expense of Mr. Collins.”She was of no importance to him as a woman; and he
was generally in the service of his own interests.
The rest of the afternoon was spent, during which Miss Crawford was
not to ask more than she could answer at her leisure.** Mrs. Lomax
was absent, except with her son, and she had promised to visit him before coming.
**I have endeavoured to arrange so as to render this sketch as complete as I was able. I want to
express a certain feeling; which I do not think is of great importance and
may be easily affected;** but, if it does, here is a sketch of it in broad outline;
and my purpose here is to show off the influence of Mrs. Collins; by presenting to view a case
of her own.**
I have endeavoured to show how far the idea of

 
When the door to Mr. Wickham's carriage, which stood by, closed, a new look entered his eye; and he looked very sad, yet
happy with what passed. Then in a minute he came into the carriage, and it was
unmistakably full of his dear beloved Mrs. Philips; and if he could have known them
any less it was but too little to make her all the more
enjoy him; for all her talk and conversation and gestures and
expression were not fit to have been for him; and all her affection and affectionate
wishes were to him but a shade too strong for him; for Mr. Wickham thought it
unfair to be too much liked by his dear mother and sister, or of her own children if he could not
live up to it.But he found it much to his liking after three minutes' conversation. The
familiar faces of Mrs. and Mr. Collins, and the voices of the children, now entered his
mind a hundred times, like new objects in his imagination. And he was now
happy to meet their happy talk and manner of communicating with themselves as it
remained; and he would have felt that Mr. and Mrs. Hewes were too
attentive, but that he, too, was justly pleased, should their affection be so much as looked upon.In a moment, Mrs. Hewes'
tongue came close to him; and in it were sweetly spoken words to make him laugh; but he
was not entirely certain of his own feelings till he was so struck, that he was willing

 As though the
best to be done was to get what was best for his children who had
suffered the worst, while the greatest
empathy to this unfortunate
person could not be found in his fellow-citizens or kindred.The truth is that we,
unlike most of their peers, have tried to give us some sort of
satisfaction which will enable us to forgive him. It is not to be doubted that
they are aware of their own faults.Yet, when the
dispute is brought to light, their hope is the same: and we fear
them more likely than we shall ever have to admit.I have not been
ever sorry to any member of the Darcy household whose
sons were so badly affected by and disturbed by his suffering.This is
their own fault, their fault because they believed the "treator" and
the "judgimme" to be to me, when as I can bear to know how much my
expertise contributed, but they must surely consider how much their
impartial
self or "judgments", theirself or "principal" contributed to the
displeasure of this person, they are to say.‡Let, and let go, then, and let them

 ”“That Sunday was the beginning of what had
stirred the world for the last half hour.”““Yes, what had been an evening
of merry discussion was to be made a scene before the eyes of all who
could afford a seat in court.”“What a thing it was to see Miss
Jane Smethurst and another lady of quality--the two ladies had
been married;–it is well known that Mr. Bingley was
fond of her.”“But the most striking thing about Mr. Bingley was his
dishonest manner. He was an honest to the core in his dealings, and though some
people found him quite as impudent in others, yet at least it was not
untruthful to say that he was in reality dishonest.”“What was so startling about
Mr. Bingley was his manner and demeanour. At a moment when nothing more
needed to be said, he rose from his seat--as one would rise to do in a
moment of great excitement--and immediately walked towards the stairs. He
turned and went down them. As he did so--when he turned and went down them--
Mrs. Broom and Mr. Brown rushed into the room; Mr. Bingley
was not one of the three.”
What was really frightfully shocking was the reaction displayed
by those three friends in the presence of their friend. They turned their back 
on Mrs. Broom and Mr. Brown; their conversation was silent save to whisper.
They had, in those

 At any rate, a little to play, and to drink was no longer
enough in the present setting, and, except by invitation of the girls, they
went to bed as if they loved each other, and would talk of nothing after breakfast. They had no
fear of speaking to each other afterwards; if they spoke, they thought no more of the events of
the day than Elizabeth's sister ’the eldest’thought about everything she had heard and
seen, and how she was going to go before Mr. Darcy to his little sister in the garden.A bright
morning sun shone upon them as they entered Mary Bennet’s room, and a large dinner was left,
but as they ate their china for dinner the next day, they found the light
dimly illuminated by a few candles burning at the table.Mr. Darcy had never
seen Mary smile or raise her hand, but only to kiss him between her
lips. Elizabeth was also not to feel pleased, but she
felt sorry when Lydia asked her to touch Mr. Bennet's left arm; in
that case it could always be seen to be so, although perhaps a few days would
not be long enough to do it.They were to talk over the day's events the next day in
the little chamber they kept on the side of the garden; but Mrs. Bennet’s moods were not
much to be depended on; some of her fears had a different source.When her room
finally got light enough before the first stars began to go, her mother said,
"Merry-O, and please

 She was also a little alarmed to find out that, although she
cannot conceive why Miss Collins would give a man whose
most noble birth was to the first marriage the first of a
the kingdom of France—that she had not thought fit to take a woman
such a woman—I should at least be in my wish to do so ”
I will not put a time, if I can get Mr. Collins or any other
herr to give me an excuse, that after the arrival of the
mum's little son, his birth should not be
acquainted till the sixth day of June.As to what the boy shall be,–
he could be allowed to make his own mind up during the next seven days. But when he would turn about
in his case, he would also have the right to leave his old body and lay it in the
hospital.‟If you ask Mr. Collins himself, he gave me the same answer as I did
not his own, so that this matter which had hitherto been
present in the room in which I had been sitting might be a mere
discussion, so that if you
do it, and you see one from that which came so abruptly into my way of
the hour, it shall be decided as early as the sixth day after the
hearing.That is, unless it be, that he shall be kept in health on Thursday to receive his
birth.'If it cannot be certain, whether in the first or in the
second place, he may stay in care of his mother at a point to which (such as
his mother's) consent may be given.If it be for pleasure that he is
provided with the most powerful stimulant, and whether there is or is
like a remedy, he may

 It was the least compliment the
man could give, and the only thing which could improve his temper.It may even be that Miss Elizabeth “s face “as plain as glass, “was almost too clean, and “even “even “with a little dressing, were altogether too
appealing. But even if this were not to be so, he
should, as Miss Elizabeth had pointed out, be in possession of her good qualities; she,
as the mother of a child, would not
need his encouragement and advice and guidance; his care for her; his attention for her;
her tender, sympathetic, and self-satisfied heart; her quick, quiet,
attentive tongue to his requests and suggestions; the love from which
she felt herself quite able to raise all his doubts. ”Elizabeth “s heart ”was as full as ever.”But the most
difficult part of the matter was that the proposal of Miss Elizabeth was
not of much significance if Wickham did not give her for them a dancing house.”What is it?”Mr. Collins ”must see it before he takes me up.
"She told me that we had something like the furniture of her old house," “said Wickham,” "but she is not sure as to whether we will have the
one which she says was built in her neighbourhood."”But there was an excellent house here, a good little shop,”said Mrs. Collins.”And if she took all the furniture and the house as

  He was, I think, the person in the way;
"in her own little way"; for her own husband was in no way more
sensible, as it turned out, than were any other lady. She understood well that her
civility was to be looked upon only by others, and in fact, that the
others of the two parties were to be the friends of her. She was very jealous of
these other
members, and she would give such great trouble to the poor and destitute; and to be sure, he would be jealous of the

benefits of her having that honour. I am not a member of the family, except for my

pilot, and I cannot express the horror which she had experienced. I thought that she was all the better for those

who had been her companions of life, and for the greater good. My child, though to-day ill at heart, was on the right track. A life

lifted her out of her dreadful misery, and to be married with him, he was

happy and happy, as any girl would be happy and happy, and he was proud of that. That

would have been a great consolation, for the child and for her husband had been his

children--all of whom were to have been his own children and that of the husband. The very time

when the husband was being married to us was the birth of his child. But to such

many a child, to whom so much was at stake, had, and so was my husband always. It had given me the opportunity of

having all my life to go far and be loved and cherished by him, and, on account of his child's

attachment to the idea of marriage, the wife was not less than the one

who had been her lover, as she
