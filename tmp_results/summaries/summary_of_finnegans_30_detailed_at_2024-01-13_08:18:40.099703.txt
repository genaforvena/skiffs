Summarizing: Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand, freemen’s mau- 
rer, lived in the broadest way immarginable in his rushlit toofar- 
back for messuages before joshuan judges had given us numbers 
or Helviticus committed deuteronomy (one yeastyday he sternely 
struxk his tete in a tub for to watsch the future of his fates but ere 
he swiftly stock it out again, by the might of moses, the very wat- 
er was eviparated and all the guenneses had met their exodus so 
that ought to show you what a pentschanjeuchy chap he was!)and during mighty odd years this man of hod, cement and edi- 
fices in Toper’s Thorp piled buildung supra buildung pon the 
banks for the livers by the Soangso.He addle liddle phifie Annie 
ugged the little craythur.Wither hayre in bonds tuck up your part 
inher.Oftwhile balbulous, mithre ahead, with goodly trowel in 
grasp and ivoroiled overalls which he habitacularly fondseed, like 
Haroun Childeric Eggeberth he would caligulate by multiplicab- 
les the alltitude and malltitude until he seesaw by neatlight of the 
liquor wheretwin ’twas bom, his roundhead staple of other days 
to rise in undress maisonry upstanded (joygrantitl), a waalworth 
of a skyerscape of most eyeful hoyth entowerly, erigenating from4next to nothing and celescalating the himals and all, hierarchitec- 
titiptitoploftical, with a burning bush abob off its baubletop and 
with larrons o’toolers clittering up and tumbles a’buckets clotter- 
ing down.Of the first was he to bare arms and a name: Wassaily Boos- 
laeugh of Riesengeborg.His crest of huroldry, in vert with

Mister Funn, you’re going to be fined again!What then agentlike brought about that tragoady thundersday

to the thunder of his arafatas but we hear also through successive 
ages that shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims that 
would blackguardise the whitestone ever hurtleturtled out of 
heaven.Stay us wherefore in our search for righteousness, O Sus- 
tainer, what time we rise and when we take up to toothmick and
