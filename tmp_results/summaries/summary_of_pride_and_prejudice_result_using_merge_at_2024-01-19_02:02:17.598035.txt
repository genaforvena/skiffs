"Pride and Prejudice" is one of the masterpieces of Miss Austen's humour and character-creation.
According to Austen, her humour has a greater affinity to that of Addison than to any other species of British humour.
There was a distinctly feminine element in "Mr.Spectator" and "The Spectator", but there was also much that was masculine in Jane Austen's humour.
