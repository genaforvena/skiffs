"Pride and Prejudice" is one of the masterpieces of Miss Austen's humour and character-creation.
According to Austen, her humour has a greater affinity to that of Addison than to any other species of British humour.
There was a distinctly feminine element in "Mr.Spectator" and "The Spectator", but there was also much that was masculine in Jane Austen's humour.

According to Mr. Goldwin Smith, Austen was a cynic and took an epicurean delight in dissecting, displaying, and setting at work her fools and mean persons.
Austen executed six capital works in two very short periods of about three years and five years.
She was raised in an English country retirement, brought up in a time when a white frost might have penetrated her house, but her manners, mannerisms and eccentricities marked her as a modern woman. Her first book in American, In Blue, was published in 1834.  She was very particular of her style and the words she said had a wide range of characters and various words. 
 She could show a skillful skillful language, but her style was not her own. She was a woman of the world, and her style was her own. This was part of her life, a story she told herself over and over again.  After three years and a half  in New York, her old friend David H

Austen is a master of realism and her art is real to a degree that makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive.
Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire and Mr. Darcy brought his coffee-cup back.
Austen's touch is similar to that of Swift's, which impressed Thackeray in his own way. Austen is a true artist, and her art is real to a degree that makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive.That's just a way of enriching the subject she's writing for me.

In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Collins is open to any suggestion that may be helpful to his policy. 
 I love the way that Mr.Brown takes an active part in the society. 
 A well-knowed speaker is always an active member of society.

Elizabeth is a heroine who belongs to the allegra or allegra division of the army of Venus.
Elizabeth has fine eyes, a bright complexion, and is not very tall, but she is clever, strong-minded, self-aware, and almost entirely destitute of ill-nature.
Her charm lies in her being distinctly clever and self aware, with a strong sense of self-confidence, good reason, and that she knows where her heart lies. All of her love and love is directed toward her own own good, so she has the courage to express her affection for her children.
She appears to be kind and compassionate, and this is one of the reasons for the interest she has in her beautiful three-year-old son. She is also a very intelligent person, and she is very fond of her children. She is also a very good cook, and she is very fond of her grandchildren.

The girls, being girls, were all staring at her empty eyes. She hurriedly gathered up the remainder of the dirty rags and put them away. 

Bingley's thoughts flow so rapidly that he often doesn't have time to express them and his letters often convey no ideas to his correspondents.
Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being deceitful, accusing him of carelessness of opinion and an indirect boast.
Darcy claims that Bingley is proud of his defects in writing and considers them a compliment to his rapidity of thought and carelessness. He asks in return, and Elizabeth replies that a man who never speaks from a position of weakness is not worthy of a daughter of his father and the same goes for a man who never spoke for himself.    “There may be other men who are also more brave than I am, and I know how hard it must be for them. There may even be men with greater natural courage and strength. If they are to live, they must learn to walk and talk, and the world must teach them how to use the instruments of their trade.

Mr. Bennet was recommended by Lady Catherine deBourgh for the living of Hunsford.
He is a clergyman and a rector with a high respect and reverence for his patroness and a good opinion of himself, his authority as a clergy and his right as a Rector.
Mr Bennet has a good house and a sufficient income and plans to marry and seek a living abroad to earn the money for his health, so he will have lots of ambition, but that will only bring about a change in his mind and will be a good companion in his work.He is a good editor and has a high respect for his patroness and a good attitude. He always needs to get away with it and it will have no relation with either of them. 
 I wonder what a good editor will write when he is a poet. Perhaps this novel will be his last as a poet.

The conversation takes place in Meryton, where Mr. Collins has a large library.
Mr. Collins invited his daughters, Kitty and Lydia, to join him and his family for a walk.

Mr. Wickham accepted their uncle's invitation and was in the house when they arrived.
Collins was impressed by the size and furniture of the apartment and compared it to a small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings.
Mrs. Philips, the housekeeper and cook, was a perfect match for him. The only thing they did not have was a table. Mr. Wickham, whose parents had once been nurses at the hospital, wanted to try the whole family out. And this was such a small apartment with no tables? This must be the old town, he reasoned, but it could only be found with some decent quality and adequate living, he explained. "Even without a table I’d get a meal down at that table," Mr. Wickham joked.  I could not believe my eyes.  I would not have thought an entire home

Netherfield is a man of large property in Derbyshire and earns a clear ten thousand per annum in rent, so the rent to Mr. Darcy is about 4,500 per annum.He doesn ’ t have a high salary, but he enjoys going on business trips and traveling overseas for a living, so he feels he is a person of his own work.What a fine idea! 
 And I too like Mr Darcy.  His life has been a constant in my life and I like to see my job being a part of his.  He would have been a great asset to a real estate company in the future as he could be a market expert when necessary.  I also

He is aware of Darcy's existence in the country but does not know his long-term future.
Darcy's father, Miss Bennet, is described by Wickham as one of the best men that ever breathed and died of cancer of your heart when he was an ordinary person. 
 What's he feeling exactly these days? 
 He feels he cannot accept the responsibilities that men like him usually do. 
 It is true of many men who were well-tempered and well-tempered, but did not actually enjoy his relations with her. 
 What he feels now is the loss of the love of him, too, he is very sad...
As a man, one's life has long run short of love. 
If my husband could have left his wife, Darcy would have made my future.

The living became vacant two years ago and was given to another man.
Mr. Darcy chose to treat the recommendation as a merely conditional recommendation and assert that he had forfeited all claim to the living due to extravagance, imprudence, or whatever else.
Elizabeth has a warm, unguarded temper and a strong opinion about him.
They were born in the same parish, within the area of present day London. We both loved and loved to spend time out in the countryside and spent all our spare time watching movies and listening to folk tunes.      That summer, they decided to move permanently to the city.

Pride has been in the lives of both Elizabeth's and Mr. Bingley.
While there has been occasional confusion over the relationship between the two, neither Darcy nor Bingley have been involved enough with each other in any sort of public life. Although neither has been the subject of an ongoing investigation, the two have worked in the same high-level company and have known each other for many years.Since our relationship has expired, you know that you can do the job well or don't you think they will be willing to give you the chance? I hope they have a position to recommend. If your company says they

The conversation takes place at a whist party where Mr. Collins is involved with his cousin, Elizabeth, and Mrs. Philips.

Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the aunt to the present Mr. Darcy, has given him a living due to her influence.

The conversation took place in a shrubbery where they had been speaking to their old friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bingley and his sisters, who came to give an invitation to a ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.
Mrs. Bennet chose to consider the invitation to the Netherfield ball as a compliment to her eldest daughter, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth and Jane were engaged to be married on the twenty-ninth of October; a date which, though not too distant, was still a little early for a celebration at the home in which they had originally been living; though the family believed that, on the other hand, it should be certain to be postponed to the house from noon, so the party would never stay, and in a quiet and quiet place for a long while.
The house in question had been built in 1818, and was a residence of Mrs. Bennet's, and Mrs. Bennet's was a house of her own. Mrs. Bennet

Elizabeth and Darcy are engaged in a silent conversation during a dance.
They are of an unsocial, untactful disposition with a tendency to avoid speaking unless they expect to surprise and impress.
During the dance, Darcy asks Elizabeth if she and her sisters often walk to Meryton, a place where they had just met and formed a new acquaintance.
Eliza and her sister, Sofia, did not answer, even though Sofia had been with the three of them in the past. Sofia insisted that they had nothing to do with the dance. She told all but the last word.   "It was very awkward for me. It was just plain scary when I saw it happening to me. It was like an elaborate trick play I wasn’t paying attention to. I mean, we tried the whole thing with a little trick. I don’t even remember that." After the dance, Sofia recalls one of the children coming in one of their classrooms looking puzzled.

Darcy and Sir William have tried different subjects before but have not had success with them due to Darcy's preference for the present.
They have discussed books, which Darcy finds difficult to discuss due to his preference for books.

Despite her initial rejection, Elizabeth insists that she is not willing to risk her happiness on the chance of being asked for a second time.
