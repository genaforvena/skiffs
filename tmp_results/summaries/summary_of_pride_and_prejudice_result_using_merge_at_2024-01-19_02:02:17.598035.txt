Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire and Mr. Darcy brought his coffee-cup back.
Austen's touch is similar to that of Swift's, which impressed Thackeray in his own way. Austen is a true artist, and her art is real to a degree that makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive.That's just a way of enriching the subject she's writing for me.
