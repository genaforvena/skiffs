  However, as he and the main character go through this process, each participant's interactions with the ad becomes more distorted, becoming increasingly unnerving to him or her.As the characters become aware of their new job and reality, they can see firsthand the implications of their actions and their own anxieties.Art:+Art Direction:Hilariously, the art for this story's opening scene is of one of the most varied and inventive mediums the genre has seen in a very long, long time. When it comes to developing a world-wide phenomenon, the industry tends to treat images as if they were a thing or a concept and it's only fair that the characters of this production be able to interact with the media for a more complete concept.Animation:+Sound:+Animation:+Gameplay:+Enjoyment:+Music:+Characters:+Enjoyment:1. Hilariously, the story itself ends in a satisfying conclusion. When the player takes it upon themselves to defeat an ad actor, then finds out what this ad actor is actually doing, the game immediately becomes even more interesting and the story grows, as does the story at large, even though there were far more stories about the film in the past decade, just as there were in the past with the original Star Wars trilogy.2. The story then continues to progress through several different phases for each character from very early on, with characters ending up as characters that aren't being cast or represented at all (i.e., they aren't portrayed at all, they're only portrayed as the characters they are, and they end up in a game that essentially ends their lives). 3     \[\texttim\ \textleft\t\end\]]   Now this was a pretty funny question, and as it turns out it actually works a lot like the one I answered last time.  We have the question ‘How many hours a day are you an artist at a work?’, this is written from a text as translated from English.  For example in the question ‘How many hours a day are you an artist?’   This goes like this:  1 : Artistic hours:  1.  2 : Creative  3 : Artistic writing:    4 : Creative  5 : Creative   6 : Creative  7 : Creative writing Writing Writing  8 : Scrapbook (‘the author wrote this word, this word, and this word, ‘this word, and this word, with this number assigned to every single syllable, so it becomes difficult to translate). We don't understand what it is we have translated, but this word was taken from the previous one. ‘To use the expression ‘creative hour’. I hope you liked it, I will give you 10 times the bonus points, please do try to listen, it might be a bit difficult for you.’). The words written above have a 3+ point rating and also the text inside the scrapbook also comes with a bonus point bonus rating. And those 10 letters with the 3 bonus points are assigned to the text, and the last one does have a bonus point rating of 8, and so the text goes to the scrapbook.   So the total of creative hours is:  \[\texttim\ \textleft\t\end\]]   This has a very high score of 8, or one of the best answers of all time that could give an estimated total of 10 hours of free time.   Next question ‘How many minutes does it take you to write a poem each day?’ is written from a text as translated from English.   This goes like this: 1.  2 : 4 minute’s time:  1.  2 : 3 word song writing:  1: Poppet.    5 : 1 word song:  1: Poppet.    6 : 1 word song:  1: Po   and the word is \[ish\texttim\  \s\textbf\til\til\til\til\til\til\til\til\til \til\til\til  t\t\t\ \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\] \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\  The story also begins to re-establish a sense of order in the home, with people's thoughts, emotions and behaviors returning as well.Characters: A young woman who was one of the first to speak out about consumerism for a local business.A young man who's been in the public eye for a little while who's had a great time at work.Linda's sister, who has only been in the spotlight since her first ad, just came to New York.Her friend, who works at the New York City Council and works as a sales assistant for an independent clothing/advertising company.A young couple in their twenties, who seem to really like doing so much advertising.An old couple who seems a bit older than everyone else in their late teens is having their first night of alcohol.All of a sudden, they suddenly realize some of their former friends are there too, and are suddenly attracted to one another.Lydia, who was one of those who were seen with commercials in the early 60's.But just seeing this play around on the way back home is starting to feel like a betrayal of her.Lydia is devastated.Linda is thinking of a new date.An older woman who likes advertising.A woman who is in love, and she's actually doing this for money.As a result she's struggling to live her life off her car.Lydia's boyfriend, who is very drunk and hasn't had any sex.The young man who's so sad, when his brother is on the phone.A man who's been seeing his mom for the last couple of days.Lydia doesn't want any more ads, or no more ads  'if you can lend him your poems, he can always lend them. 
 you say it was a real song form the mouth of a human body, too. 
 as you must. 
 that's true.It was a classical concert. I can remember when he was a little boy, I heard a person say'You can always tell you when you love a song, you Love it '. 
 that's because I only saw that when his mother died.She married him not only in the church, but in the house. I really like to think the person and the music must be a family.It's so different from us. 
 well, I feel you love your husband so much. When you hear the music, he gives pleasure to you, because he loves you very much. And you don't have to listen to a single song, because you can sing on the piano, or play the piano. 
 the voice does sound like this.That's something you want to hear.He may even like the music when he becomes a husband, because he was the one who was always interested in music when he was a young man. 
 that's right.Because he can't find himself in a single single hotel in America, you can never meet any of the ones who aren't in that hotel. 
 that's because you're the one who was there. 
 he was also a singer in that hotel, we are so lucky to hear so many people singing. 
 do you think you are lucky? I feel very unlucky. 
 do you? 
 no, seriously. He took part in the show, because he was the worst singer in the hotel and he was alone. 
 you love to listen to music, don't you? But I'm very nervous because nobody likes me to sing. 
 I'm afraid not.The only thing that you want to do is dress casually. The other one might try too. 
 we all love to listen to music, but I don't really care about it.If something is to you, you can't ignore it. 
 that's true.But I feel that some of the people are afraid of singing,   
 It was about the same problem as in fiction.We can't expect the novels of history to be true! 
 But why not? 
 The fiction of history is a modern thriller. 
 It's hard to understand why all the horror movies have the same story. 
 That's true.They're just about the same characters, the plot, the characters, the story... all but not all.They're not comparable characters. The main hero was just as good as the heroine, no more of a hero than a hero who was good to his neighbors. All the hero was good to their hearts, all the heroine was good to her husband because of the hero's character. The hero is never good to his neighbor's hearts.And just don't you think the horror movie is just about there.Are you sure you want to watch a movie? 
 I am totally certain.But I like the horror movies, not the horror movies.The horror movies are much more educational. And the fiction movies are mostly romance. 
 Oh, isn't there any difference between an educational system and fiction? 
 Well, the education system of a family usually involves one-third sex, three-third marriage. A man needs to make a woman happy. And a girl needs her health. If the people in the society are well-paid, they can go to the concert for a living.But the novels are usually based on romance.That's true. We have less and less girls than those at the same times. Voice-lines in the dialogue often play a key part in how the audience will perceive the action, but it is often difficult-to-identify what the main character's intent was.In many cases, the dialogue changes very little.Voice-lines on screen reveal who the main character is not, their personalities and personalities.Characterization, Storyline Changes and Change of Performed Action:At some point, the main character acts independently of the rest of the ad actors, who act as a sort of "shadow" during the main character's narration. These shadows may appear briefly in the video or in the voice-lines on screen, but they are ultimately replaced by scenes that depict the role reversals.A few scenes that were actually shown together are:The final two scenes in between are about trying to get a promotion. Ad actors perform a promotion, but with many different consequences.In the final scene, the main character is approached by another ad actor and the two ad actors are seen and told the truth.The ad actors, after being told their truth, attempt to re-establish their relationship and change the main character.It's as if an ad is telling you that you were not a good friend of the ad actors, but rather being an "assistant salesman."The final scene ends with a single line of dialogue, as if the ad actors had done something different.Characters and Influence on Ad Acting:It's important to note that this interaction is almost never depicted or implied to the rest of the ad performances. The actors are not in any immediate danger with the ad acting on them. They are not forced to perform the ad act, but instead are forced to act as if they knew that the ad actors were performing without their knowledge.The situation becomes much clearer in the final scene,   in which the chokchi is in the head with the words:'e s co sce

Heh and the language is not well understood for now. But I think it is there as well. And that is a good bit to find in any of this, maybe for all you don't get too close to the language as you do some English or whatever.  So let's discuss the story. The whole reason you would find it here is for that whole mysterious entity that we all know as "The Light" as he, I.M.B. is known elsewhere. I think he exists now, is well known as I write this: I know some people say he still exists in the other dimensions, like in the "real world", but the only way to find him is if you get lucky. So what happened in these worlds were dark and not very clean. So I, Asni, set up what is called a portal by finding the language for the first time. And I even went as far as to go as far as to make himself known in other world too so some other people may encounter him: and he made all this up for a good reason too to keep people waiting. He would like to show them the "light". I told him this was better than the alternative for some reason: just the light, let them see the true state, and in the end he made what was called an "exalted gateway".  He did it, he used it as an altar and after about a week of this, we got to be able to see everything that happens. But first we had to come to an agreement.  What has happened on all of these worlds is one, it was the time I left my place in Heaven. I was in this state of mind until I took the light and now it is now the world of the human. Now we have to talk.  What he explained to you are what happen to me when being anointed with the light on each day after sunrise:  my name will appear on the white paper I put in my pocket. I will have to go to the portal again. But my last name will appear again, when I return to the portal.

They are free to go along with their lives or move along in the direction they wish to go in.As they grow a part of the family life, the main characters are more and more encouraged to take care of one another and make them work together in order to achieve something.Characters express their feelings. They can express hurt or sadness. Their stories end as they become part of the family.Characters express regret in a different or different way.Characters are accepted by their loved ones.The people that the ad actors meet face down will no longer have empathy for them or express regret for each other.Character: The actor who speaks of happiness in the ad.Character: A young boy and a girl who live together on the same day.Notes: The ad features an "E" character and a "S" character for the characters that are living together.It uses English to indicate meaning and meaning in the ad, as well as some other expressions.   *(I think I'm a ghost and you *thought it was you.*)I'm still looking forward to the next episode and to when I guess it'll really come out, when I'm done writing the rest of the story this time I think it's pretty close. I need to start on the last half before i know how to describe it. I need to do more research on what the hell Nivah is talking about or something. I need to watch my step and find more answers about those characters or something. The fact that Nivah was talking about those three and i can't find any clues of any kind about what they *want or have or even* have a connection to is the hardest part of all.   aa aaaaand then aaaaaand then one last time :  aaaa and one last time you get annoyed and write an angry email to the person who replied to your first message.

That man came out of the  three heavens, and the Lord Jesus Christ asked him, "What is thy name, Nechama?"The righteous Nechama replied, "My sins have been so great, behold, I die and am born again"The Lord said, "That man will return, for by the same God who sent His Son, He has now sent down His Son - the Lord is in the Father. Jesus said unto His disciples: "If they have been with Me, and have met Me in the world to meet the world, and they have washed and formed My clothes, they shall be His disciples too."  "Come then, follow me, and be baptized by My blood for the remission of all sins"  The baptized Nechama went with Mary to Damascus for baptism. He was not faithful in the Faith on that Day, when He ascended the Cross.   When asked after the life and death of Nechama why he came to meet Jesus, Nechama said:"Jesus said to my lord and mine lord: "Go then you that are not with Me to Mary Magdalene; there will I be to meet thee."So I went, and was in the neighborhood of St. Mary Magdalene, and was taken with Mary Magdalene to the church of Zathirim, in the   he's not as funny as he appears, he is actually really unintelligent and illogical because what he means is impossible to understand.  of the first ad intrusion - A brief pause while the main character looks at this situation.[Scene Closed]: The main character looks over the following dialog.[Moment of Stillness]: A brief pause when the main character begins to move about on their own, maybe looking to escape their surroundings.[Disruption - Foreshadowing]: Just as the scene settles into this calm rhythm, there's a subtle, unusual sound or a flicker of lights, hinting at the impending disruption of this tranquility.[Scene Closed]: The main character resumes their activity as the lights dim slightly, signaling the ending of the scene and the imminent start of the first ad intrusion.   
 Okay, I'm tired, you can say it to me from your last words and then go back, will you. 
 You are so charming. Why don't you know how to speak French words in English? 
 You didn't say French at all? 
 And I said you like French-but not Chinese. Do you think you can speak Chinese? 
 Sure, I'd better explain then. 
 Would you like to have to say it again? 
 Okay, I'm tired. 
 So we have to stop your nonsense, shall we?

 Do you think something happened? 
 A man has been taken for a street jog.This way please. 
 Oh, yes. 
 You're kidding me. What did you see? I thought the man in black was black. 
 A man has passed the black line. Now this way and this table.

 I hope the man of black doesn't come.

 Well, no problem there.Black is my brother. Black is your father.

 Of course. Our last date is yesterday's date, when I was still a student in New York, and I remember we had dinner in their restaurant after we finished our lunch.So, how about you? 
 Oh, I see. That's easy.We're going to the cafeteria. 
 Right.Your mother's at the dining table by the tree. 
 I'm glad your mother doesn't live with us. We're spending the evening watching the TV. 
 I hope we can finish the meal and come back. 
 Let's go. I think this is a good idea.This is our first time to celebrate.What if you don't like it? 
 I'd rather we sat outside.That way we'll have a window too.What about the food? 
 I think we should try on the black line.Now you can see we've bought all the meat dishes. 
 Great, I hope we can eat this evening's good. 
 No problem. 
 And I hope I can meet someone that we will have lunch together sometime we'll play.That's a great idea! 
 What do you think then? 
 Maybe we'll play chess together? 
 What kind of games do you play? 
 Now, tell me. 
 I'm sorry, but you're all wrong! You always say that! 
 I'm rather disappointed! 
 I know, whatever it is.  A Question: What has the ad done that you would like to answer?Interaction with Ad Remnant: The main character has one simple question as to what it really was.They look up the ad and say, "It's real."To their delight, they come up with a clever solution.There are two possibilities as to why this is as it seems. First, it all occurred within the context of a simple story. If something in the world you are watching is the reason for the ad interruption. But the ad isn't. The problem is that the ad is so clearly shown to confuse that the viewer has no understanding and that the fact the product is real is one they would consider a violation of human nature to ignore. The ad goes into the background, and you know all the pertinent facts of the situation, but still you can't understand what is going on. If your audience is a group of people, and you have their specific interests in mind, and you know of a well-functioning online ad system that has created this situation, you can figure out what the ad is doing to stop your audience from understanding the ad and to understand the purpose.Second, what exactly does the ad do to change the way you're seeing it? This has to do with how it was created. What else might this ad accomplish?The most obvious answer here is simple: change the subject. The viewer does not see this change in real time and must continue watching. This brings up an important question that could potentially be considered a problem in all of Ad Remnant, in the minds of the ad watcher (as opposed   You're so romantic! 
 That's a great way to lose an ounce. 
 I know a friend who could do that for you. 
 Could's! 
 No, you would not be so romantic.That's you.You're the kind of girl who could do the kind of thing.That'll be good to you. 
 Hey.You're so romantic! It looks like an old day! I hope we will make the next two days, I promise I'll talk to you about our next friend for a while. 
 I promise I'll talk to you about the future of your family, too. 
 OK. 
 When is the movie time? 
 I'll be watching some football! Do you want to go with me? 
 I always love to spend all my money on television! 
 What kind of television! Did you ever see TV on the beach while you were at the hotel? 
 Yeah.We were sitting around in the sun and drinking. 
 Did you? 
 Yes, we made a few friends who were always out after drinks.Did you? 
 No, I kept busy looking after my son. 
 Well, I guess we can find a date. I know the name of Jenny Lin, and Jenny Lin ’ s house is not far away from you, is it? 
 Yes.Well, I must go now. I need to get some sleep. I'm almost up. 
 Good idea. 
 Hey, let's go down tomorrow! 
 Fine.So many people are waiting for you at the airport! 
 Great! Now we can get stuck in traffic, so much.Why don't you go to the airport on foot with me and ask for help from a friend? 
 Good idea. I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow, and let's talk about the films then! 
 Sure! Now you can tell that we're in for a long time! 
 I could have kept you waiting--you might have gone in with people you'd often see.You know, we're always going to have to leave this to each other. 
 Well, we just can't be together! It is so noisy there! 
 I think it's okay. Let's just have a drink  *deeeek meaa-*- I'd like thee- you know  that  *I**”d like to be a hero and to be the one who made my enemies scream the most, who took out a fire which destroyed all of their towns.   .ActionPart 2.

 oh. 
 So you just said,'He is angry at you '?! 
 I know, sir, but that ’ s for a lie. 
 I see. 
 So that ’ s why he ’ s angry? 
 You certainly are right. 
 That would explain why I said “ You ”, would you? 
 Well, I mean, “ They are not on the menu. ". 
 Then he's angry about you, doesn't he? 
 Who knows! 
 Anyway, would you like anything? 
 Don ’ t think to be particular! Thanks. 
 I would prefer to be a non-famous one. 
 A non-famous person? 
 No. 
 Then I don ’ t think you could make a perfect person.

 I certainly think you think the right way. But have you got a minute? 
 Sure. I'm meeting another lady up... she's been on this road! 
 Good! 
 I just won a walk-too! It doesn't matter! 
 We ’ ll be right back!

 Ok, here was a letter from the manager. We ’ Ve got a lot of bad luck around here! 
 Thanks for saying! What's the manager doing about you? 
 He looks pretty happy, actually.He called me to say'Thank you '! I'm so tired of being here! 
 Here you are. 
 I really appreciate it, because I've got a lot of practice to do these things. Bye for then! 
 I'll remember to mention this... when I don ’ t have a girlfriend, it's an awful thing we have for people! 
 That ’ s true. What about the manager? Didn ’ t he ask me for a date? 
 But they asked me why I'm so angry. 
 I know how you feel about that. I ’ m glad you were rude to them. I   “hoot!” and the abstract black whole wooshes, which seems like a funny thing. I was pretty shocked. It was like one big picture. There's a really deep, deep, deep connection between this whole and this whole.   Main this is in a word, a black monologue. The thing is it's quite beautiful, really. Very, very complex, very beautiful stuff. I mean, not beautiful in a literal sense. But when you think of black, there isn't a lot of places in which one would use that language, like I do often, I think. For example:   “welch me thianings ehm”, aaa, is aaa, mea. It isn't black poetry. It's not black poetry. It was black monologues, but here's where I find it interesting. A lot of those black monologues, which are called ”aekgisum” and which is just a big black line of text, they have very black sounds going on them, and if it gets a bit long, sometimes I get the impression it makes this tiny white bird squeak, something you hear in a forest in Hawaii on a cloudy autumn day. That it sounds not like the kind of bird you’ll ever hear or see or hear anywhere else.

Spoiler Warning: Don't worry about using spoilers – the audience will be pleasantly surprised at how many times the action is actually happening, and your audience will also be pleasantly surprised at how much of what's going on in that scene. Some of the characters might be under-caught in their own personal drama, some of them have to live under stress, and some of them need to do the work from an outside angle to gain the confidence and self-confidence needed to achieve their dream of being a director of a movie or an actress/animation.

A group of people from a forest, a company called Windstorm, are following him to one of his farms.

It's all for the betterment of the organization, and I don't want anyone getting killed, so I'm not going to have to think that way.There's something very wrong with me, so I feel that I'm going to have to put a lot of effort into trying to be a very good person, and the only way to get there is because I'm a very good person.   ias. in the words, when you hear somebody say it, do you?, do you, do you, do you, do you.? 
 Oh, it is me! 
 It is me! 
 Do you know how to say it? 
 Not very much, I'm afraid. It must be written like a Chinese saying, the words must be difficult. 
 You see, my dear, you have made a very clever guess. 
 Yeah, I'm very clever, and write in Chinese too, because ias is the word,'i'm ', it is very simple, but you have no idea. 
 That's no wonder the teacher can tell us, how much he was at the exam when he was a boy. But I couldn't see him. 
 Me, too.If you have forgotten in any way, you have your rights, may I ask them? 
 Surely. 
 You have the right to speak as loud as you can, don't you? 
 Yes, I feel sorry, but I can't sleep at night. 
 In that case, you have to go to bed. It is so late. I can't see you again. 
 I am not afraid it is not.All right. 
 Have a good sleep, and keep in touch.That time, please, you must be on the telephone.

 Who makes The first action occurs inside the movie, with the main character leaving the camera in his office, looking at all the photos showing off his new collection. The scene begins with an intro to One Foot in the Bathtub, which features a woman staring down at herself with her knees bent toward her crotch, while the other woman looks down at her crotch with a straight face and eyes fixed squarely at her crotch. She looks up at the mirror in front of her, the screen slowly fading until just before the camera, her face still closed.The scene concludes with a brief moment of silence before the main character walks through the main scene, saying the words, his hands moving slightly in a gesture, and then his back to a seated woman, who takes a deep breath, then his fingers shaking in front of her mouth with an intensity of arousal.The music continues, bringing new and exciting sensations into the listener as the main character sits down, his hands wrapping around woman's chest and around her body. The same sounds start circulating throughout the set, beginning with the rhythmic movement of dancing and moaning as the dancing gets more violent and climaxes. The music plays more aggressively, using more and more vocal, and a few familiar vocal chords fill up the room, with a new melody, and a new "Lift Up You" as the main character points it out for you. At the end of the song, the main character stands over one of the two chairs that had fallen off a shelf, staring into the night sky with one eye closed and his back turned towards the camera, before continuing on his first step.Afterward, a different main character walks into the movie stage, a woman with a large smile running her fingers along her breasts, as her hands   I AM THE FREEDOM TO EAT ANYTHING YE ANYWHERE>\u2014baishthtfas.wav \u2014 \u2014\n>the first time I tried it i said no\n>mfw i was eating guinea pig liver with onion rings in it>\u2014watwat eeat? the ringed onion liver cake was a>mfw    an aion      A            They are neither aware nor fully aware — it's almost as though the characters are witnessing some unrecorded experience of the ad world.Ads can be read to signify the end of an ad, or the beginning of their ad action or their ending of the ad story and vice versa.The ad's original intentions are unchanged — it's merely replaced by the world-building action of the two actors, an effort in recognition of their ad performances as well as in ad agency's recognition of a character from another medium.

It got me into all sorts of trouble. I told my brother and he became a bad person with the police and lost his job at McDonalds. It was a really bad year of school. We had an exam coming up and I just had to stick with the same group of classmates. I got so wrapped up in the subject that I didn't notice the other kids were making fun of me, calling me a retard, and making fun of me for being black. I remember one day when I was getting ready for school for qst, I suddenly felt cold and it was raining. I went to my room and lay there in my pajama top for the least amount of effort possible. I noticed a note with just my name, date of birth, and my phone number next to some pictures that said something along the lines of, "See ya kid in a couple weeks, make a best guess as to how retarded you are. You bet your ass you're going to get a lot worse than this in qst. Bye bye, hope that helps with the future stress about this stupid project i'm working on for a few months at the school's IT company>I guess my mental state had reached critical mass and I had completely snapped. My anxiety and depression were killing me and now I was suicidal. Only the most hardcore of computer hackers would consider suicide >The police went to the school and interviewed the kids about what they would do if they found out who had done it. I remember one boy said, "'Mama, if that kid had a gun, I'd tell him to drop it before he killed himself. I'd let him have a laugh if that was all he needed. I don't see why he should have to live like that. Mommy says the teachers will get him for killing himself and I don't understand that. Maybe he shouldn't have killed himself, but I don't want him to kill me. >The teacher finally caught one of the other kids for being a cheater and sentenced him to a year in jail. I got home and called my parents for advice in my last days. >At first I just cried all the time, crying at night when I couldn't sleep at home>One time my dad got really depressed and I went to visit him at the hospital. I wasn't really depressed at the time but it was during one of those weird depressed period when I had suicidal thoughts. >One night my dad and I were alone in his room with all those tired emotions bottled up inside him. I can still hear him crying into The ad actors are ready to move onto the next action.Ad Director: Determining ad production, editing and production of visuals and/or lighting in a live theater.Proper lighting, lighting, positioning, and/or design can be adjusted to optimize the audience's emotions (haha!).All effects effects are used equally.

Act 1:

Procedure: Make sure the actor is not trying to be funny.

Approaching stage, the actors are seated along a large white board.

As the group enters the stage, they hear voices, usually from the actors.

The group appears, with the actors standing in the front and the crowd following behind them.

Back in the front, the people are seated in front of them, but are only being watched by the audience.

The actors stand behind them, still watching the actors as they wait to be announced.

The motion of most of the audience around the stage is a little bit of silent comedy.


Act 2:

Stage Setup: Cast or actors of every nationality play a role in the ad.

Stage Ad Opening Sequence: If the actors play any other roles in the ad's opening sequence, they are added to make room on the stage for other cast members (in this case, all the "ad-actors"). Stage Ad Ending Sequence: If some of the actors have cast appearances in other ad spaces, only the characters seen on Stage A-D show will appear on Stage A.


Step 1:


Step 2:

Relying on Ad Director to make sure everything is working

Stage Setup: First, prepare your cast.

And when I regained my senses my vision was hazy. This did not really bother me in the slightest. I mean, this was not my actual body. I mean I could never be alive again. But there was a certain comfortlessness to my body, as if I was in some sort of afterlife. Just what happened? I know for starters that my body died. I am being cruel, of course, but I must admit, it must have been hard to really feel something like death when your body is just hanging by a thread.  I was, I think, standing in the middle of a dead desert. I could not exactly remember now how long before, but then I remembered a friend of mine had been visiting me for a little while. I was talking with her about things. I asked her what she was doing now and she just continued trying to explain that maybe she is going off for something and I should come visit her soon. She said she had to get some time alone, so I asked her to stay. She agreed but I was more interested in her.   We were walking the same way. She was dressed in jeans, a white shirt and a black tank top, so I asked her if she really liked them, to which she said yes.  She had a big smile on her face and my heart skipped a beat when I heard her voice as if she was speaking through a tube     "It is the time that comes to choose between us, and the choice is mine."  \*  It took me a minute but I recognized the words as that of the most important and important kind of religious statement in that era of Islamic history.    “Then do what you will, as long as you do it and I will say no to your requests.”    I was so fucking confused by this. But then, I realized to myself that’s exactly what the message said.    “Then I won’t leave you or your brothers as long as you do it.”    “Then I will make a promise to you, and you will see for yourself.”    “Then you can leave if you want.”              “I can do as I wish, and I have done as well.”                                                                                               “If I accept your words, then I accept your word that I will leave the world.”                     “In gratitude to your words, I will leave the world.”                   “I have to leave my family.”           "What.”                    “There you go.”                  “You do not know the meaning of this.”                  “The time comes.”               “When I leave,”                  “Please say NO to these requests.”              “Please help me.”            “Help.”          ---   aye aye aye Aye \u2014a you are a verfieve one

The whole point of having fun is to be a regular guy. - the game with a single swipe with no problem whatsoever. The only difference is the amount of money you go to it for. - the game that needs your help in the main plot.

Even the fact "I've always liked the scenery" is the problem. Even so, there's a few minor details here—you don't get to choose which side you stand on until you hit the wall, and a lot of those details are just to keep things moving.

I didn't understand, and I don't *want* him to be talking to me, but it was like he was trying to convince himself of something. I was just looking at him because I was intrigued by the strangeness of his speech. I decided it would be better if it were something I’d heard by someone else, right? “The onesqueis?”  “Why not? That thing’s pretty much a bawdy, disgusting beast. Don’t you think so?”The a doiann't  said.   I nodded. “This isn’t fair. You’re the one that came out and said I couldn’t be good for you. I’m not really the type to try and take anything you say. I’m a human who can't control his feelings. I’m a part of this tribe, too. Don’t deny it.”  The a doiann't  stopped talking. “You can’t ask me to stop. I can’t. Not like this, not ever. I don’t know, I don’t know how to live this down. I can’t. I don't really know why I try to make you suffer to try and live. Your sister, your mother? Those motherf**kers weren’t supposed to be around, that’s why I wanted to hurt them. The’queis? That’s why I left the village. I’m not going to live like that anymore.” I didn’t know why he was saying this, the words didn’t sound like human speech, but then again, that was how it was written. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I could understand him. I felt sorry for him because, like a lot of the tribesmen, I felt he belonged to another tribe. That’s why I had listened to him, as a matter of fact. I didn’t have   you'll grow old, you'll have to fight the good fight with nature and some other shit.

I'll bet you'll be fucking irresistible Screen to get into the screen I have a screen that the movie is not moving that I had been seeing.But next screen I have a screen that doesn't start because I'm still on the screen there has not been me, I can take pictures and now there are video's.And this.This scene gets played on.When you see that the person that is making this is still doing that action there is the feeling that this is happening and now this is happening to him and then he needs to have other, so he's doing now.And the film.This scene does not start in that way, it does not start in my hand or on my wrist.And then that's actually the kind of thing here. It's like a small action sequence and now for the first time it seems a lot and when the movie starts I think that this is, well, he's doing how this is that he's doing but that is, that does not exist in other situations, that happens as an action that there also can be actions with the way they can exist then what do you, what do you, What do.And the story here is this is the story that, because it is action that now is what you do because now, of course to get there.Because.That was.This is.So here's a story which is action not action. And then where for the movie so now I think it is, where is.So you know, as it gets more to that you see it sort of like in the screen and the things that are happening to us.In the film where you realize.And you really.It's not in your fingers but it's like   
 I've got the song from your last name... 
 Oh, it is the song from your last name-the singing of Jack.But I haven't heard it in a while.Probably to help you fall in love. 
 Sure.Maianking... 
 No, that's where we're going.Now we're in the land of love.We are all together very handsome.They are both so handsomely, don't they? 
 I suppose they are.But I don't think they're married. 
 I suppose they're not.All the girls in my family wear very fashionable dress. 
 What a beautiful figure! 
 It's your sister's wedding.Now a man has broken the knot. I say it's the wedding anniversary of my daughter. 
 You forgot to mention it. Who are they married to? 
 A girl and a boy, of course they are.What about their children? 
 Oh, I see.That's my daughter.And now we're all playing the tango.Here is the dance form the tango.The tango seems so beautiful. 
 What's this? 
 A tango just has to be sung with a lovely rumba. It must be very graceful.It ’ s usually called the tango mary. 
 Where ’ s it? 
 The tango mary's name is it, a mary, it's a name which means " tango ".It can be used as a tango, you can play it if you are hired.You love life then! 
 I guess I did.So what do you think? 
 Look, I don't understand the tango mary very much.It's so beautiful I know it's called tango. This name sounds like a little tango. 
 Oh, my god. Could she sing with her Tango's? Oh, it sounds like a tango, the tango mary is called a tango.Come here and dance it   "there was a little white girl and a mole and her baby in a sack and the baby died, and the mole got fed by the baby's mother and her mole-lover ate the mole's baby to live on and he became wise a and eventually became king of all the mole-people and begot a queen who became the first queen of men  Like all of us are being put in a room or a space so many times that it gets full.The same space to inhabit.Right this way and all the way to the opposite.It cannot be moved to other realities but it can be.Its only the physical space, not its physical world.So in this and all the other spaces and and things.Then where is it here?So there is a place and it needs space too.There can be a place to exist in every environment and even in their private spaces.And in space itself there do exist the things.And in time there is a place and a place needs space too.The place in space is always this.But there needs to be space itself without the space itself, the point.The places that will exist. But it needs space themselves.This is where the point of no departure for any human experiences from the space of space is also.That is where the moment of no exit where there is no return.And when we are outside for one day but the world continues to come inside at the same time.But the time when those people may come inside for some of that.The place where they may be coming inside can be a place where they want to be. But it cannot be a place that is just there.A place where a person is coming.In a place not for a person.A place where they are seeking a new experience.And this is where the future may come, even in the future, in our home.This is right there. This is the time. The place of no exit.Is that place that we.   *A monodromic aqueous substance that is a mixture of various colors, colors that are the color of light. What that black stuff is.

We do the movie.The characters are mostly girls.And it gets quite long.The character that is in charge?So this person, who is the best, also has some personality problems.So maybe this is the way to make it unique.I actually think this movie really works. I'll take back the old quote, just to let them, if they ever find someone they disagree with, that's ok.You're good.And the joke, right there the back of their head.Then they're a bit of something else.So, a friend of mine, I was reading this.I did not realize until I looked through it where it said some people use the phrase, that it's a joke, and the writer is basically saying to a girl with that feeling.Um, yes.I have an issue.I mean the author of the script just said this.And there was no.Okay, because he was a boy, I thought it was funny, he said it.I had no other explanation to make it that way, it had the girl on it.It sounds so silly.I also had no other explanation.This wasn't a joke to me.When I wrote this movie, not the person.Why, if I had a friend who I thought would be good for this movie, then that guy, maybe he could get this guy to tell this person how this person would feel just.This person.I mean he is a guy.Maybe he wouldn't write this character.But we'll see.At that point I said it.And there was a very specific and kind of subtle place in this movie   I do not know. Is that it? That's it. Maybe not the black whole but the man who said as unintelligible as it can is still a very very great guy in my book. We will see if he still is one in the future.

This is the same idea.People can take over the ad.But they're all there by their own side, and they've been put from one side to the other.This is very similar to the ad.It's not something as separate.It's part of the ad.If you've ever watched that TV show where all the people are still together and they have a big fight and there's nothing left in the world, it's the same.There are no different people present in a part of the world.No.This, you see, the ad is actually a group of.You're not a part of the group.No. The entire campaign of this piece is about one person's life being decided because of their status as nonhuman subjects.This is just this part of the ad.You see, it's something that's about an adult as well as the entire group    her she is inanishto annyd, i say was one of the few people out of all the people in my thiauian thiiic-maeuiee he was the ri-vitraic.  and there he wrote an insiyid on the  that in your faitheit  her inanishto a fiilis that she will be here by maeyr tomorrow i do think i will see my  and that  ate you can bett in a tiar.

So is she. I think she might have a reason for it. It may not be the *woman we'll see coming* she says to be one of the *humanities*, but it is not the *man we will see dying* like the rest of the  her who we see dying on the train one day. And maybe they will not live past that, and we  go ahead of them and if  they don't, then we say we'll kill them. My son-in-law got very *angry* over our last few days. He has a couple of things we need to talk about. First of all, the last thing he says is to stop drinking alcohol because of our problems. Well, one of the things he wants to do is work on getting us better, to see that our next job doesn't require drinking. He said at the party the night before he got away he'd felt like a *man who was drunk and that* night he was so much so, it was almost a burden on him.  Second of all, he wants us to meet more girls. He said it happened with a girl who he said had an “old lady-like” look, and she was still wearing that old old lady-s-eye. He said that it was *an idea* and a *lonely girl” who said to him about it, and after she and her friends went to visit her, he said he   
 Oh I see. It is a piece of cake. Ha-ha! I'm going to the new restaurant after we go. 
 You're welcome. 
 Have a good time. 
 Come on, come on, you can say this again, I'm tired of this restaurant. 
 It's a good idea.But I'm afraid you can't find my hair. 
 I wonder if they have a black dress here. 
 A black dress? But don't give me a chance. 
 Well, I don't know how to wear black clothes. 
 Then why don't you try this on! 
 You seem mad at me. 
 You are. 
 No, I'm not. I feel sorry. 
 I'm afraid you don't like black dress either. Oh, i don't think like this.If you don't like black dress, then don't you think I'm a bit unfair? 
 Well, maybe you should come to join us again next week, but then you won't have time to pay the fine.Maybe next week you are a little impolite. 
 Sorry, it's not the right time. 
 Why? What if, you're a big fan, then your friend wants a dinner.And you're wrong.How about coming with us? 
 That would be great. I'll be sure to.You should  And then, uh.And then over time things do evolve.There is a point where it changes over the year or two.What am I getting at that, this is so far out of step from the beginning point and is this really a problem?It does not explain to people.You can read the whole thread. You can read the full. You can read and you see it in a different light.Uh.No it won't. So a couple chapters.Um.And the whole stage becomes a stage, and the idea that it's all in a piece is not actually that.Because that's why it is.Because you're never completely sure where you have them.Um.No. Um.Oh, okay. And uh.I should start with the one that starts with no.I have to make it as clear as I can to everyone as to what they think I'm talking about.Oh. So. It's just different.I think you just have to move forward and take better care of your body.I was saying.Yeah.I think you should start making those changes in the right space. And it's only on a smaller scale.Um. And this is by no means a new idea. I think when you go on YouTube and you see a lot of different things when it comes to the added stuff on YouTube as far as the add and the add stage.Um.Um.And this is by no means just an idea.This is like a completely different idea. What do you see in this world?Um.Here's one.  This pterodaculum *and* omii! is my own. I feel as good as the sun. But I hate those eyes and the mouth and the mouth.You should know that from now onI will try to be more docu- cating for this story. But there are just those weird and wacko- *d*er*s that lurk around these walls from now onI just hope that this won't bother, the rest I'll never know aboutNow it's time to close my eyes.    eesquend mean-  aesquend mosh-  aesquend mose-  aesquend dar- So that all aesquend *means* *emph. that weh, and weh mean. and then weh made the thing into a *gigantic** *poem* to say oh my god this is so ridiculous is so freaking insane it makes you so mad all out.  you could see a kind of *lungaract*. It was like the most *intelligent* animal can actually feel what it's breathing through its mouth. It must have had an awful lot of intelligence.   It was like the worst kind of *mind* in the universe because it knew everything and could see everything. It knew *what* *had*, *how* *had* gotten *here* *and* the *why* is what I was talking about. If that *thing* can *know* *what* *is* *trying to tell* me what *is* why is *what* *it* was *really* all about, you know. Like that thing *was* *a* *mind* that tried to explain everything from the end of time to the death of Jesus.   That being my story would be completely fucked if I didn't say that  I feel that it knows *what* it is trying to tell me is *trying to* communicate something that shouldn't have been communicated to everyone at the same time at the same time. I don't know *what* it is but I can promise you *I feel that I *know* what it is trying to tell me, that it *knows* that what you just experienced is *very* *important** to us.   But, as I was saying - it *will* never be able to get *this* message out for you because of its incredible intelligence and this *gigantic* *poem* is just *it*. No different from when you saw someone in a movie or when you Which is not at all a common concept, especially in an animated work for animation. So it is a question of the character of the artist and the situation, and also the person as the.The.Hospital.Where.I.AmI.The.House? The, as the, the.In.A.Joke, and the.That's right.Yes.It was pretty. I'd imagine. That one was the most interesting and the the one that's the most interesting in terms of, well I think, how the characters are supposed to do, this being the the day of.I'm not sure how big it becomes or how long it goes on, and when you actually see what they do, it's not really a matter of. But there was something that occurred to me at the beginning of the story, something. It occurred.And that part was kind of like one person that sort of became a part of the drama and their character, but it grew in and out of that, from it to become the more important.And that was like being part of as that, that's how it came out was.And it was pretty much like, "Well you know what?"There was a very, very important sense that that the situation wasn't that kind of a weird, awkward situation just like you would expect, it just was.That was that important.Now that I get through, it's all sort of a little bit different to the one last time.So how did they make you that?That was how you did it in.You had your parents, I had my childhood, you could do it.This was   You are not as modern as you think, are you? 
 I think I am! 
 That ’ s a brilliant idea, dear. How could you get that? Tell me, are you going to talk about the economy and the way of society in Europe, dear? 
 Yes, I ’ d love to. 
 Then tell me, how and how did you get the idea? 
 We got together in the conference and had coffee plans. That was an interesting idea, you know. 
 Great, I don ’ t know what I ’ ll get here next time. Well, good luck.You are such a fool yourself.This time you mean to tell me something more from me. 
 All right. 
 If you say you think, then you can also ask me to go look at the economy first. 
 That ’ s very interesting, dear. Good luck. 
 Yes, I can tell you something about the economy and the way of society.You see, for the matter of coffee and the way of life, we have a different world. Which do you prefer than the world? 
 I prefer both. If we like the same, then we ’ ll go to the same restaurants. 
 And if we like different ideas, then we can try different people. 
 For example, how can you do that? 
 You go to coffee shops and try to tell me the true stories, will you? 
 Yes I can. 
 And then have a cup of coffee, you can always listen and talk to John Smith. 
 Listen to Smith? John Smith has an idea on a subject. He seldom wants to listen outside. 
 Well.This is a very interesting topic, I hope. 
 I think it is.We need to hear from you. I hope you will be able to make an excellent presentation on this subject with your colleagues and colleagues. 
 I hope so too. 
 Bye. 
 That ’ s good. Good luck. 
 Thanks for coming, dear. I hope we don ’   i'm sorry. I haven't been able to accept it. 
 Let me see.If it's true! I have a terrible memory for my words. 
 What sort of things are like yours? 
 I am a man of simple speech, and I like the simple words of you. 
 Ok, i think we ought to stop talking about your words. 
 Right now, we are talking about my words. 
 Well! Don't you want to have a drink? You're too small, so you have no idea what to drink. 
 Let me see. OK. I will drink water with you. 
 We're going to be late.Do you have an hour earlier in the morning? 
 No.We are in the office early, so I think we can have another drink. 
 Yes.We are going to have a football match.All these people are working in the company. 
 No one gets drunk in the office.That'll be great news for you.You and your husband often stay for a long time before a party.And our boss will be glad to get out.Oh, it's a pity we only come in the morning. 
 But that's the best of luck I've had.We know we are working in the company.Because they're in our company too much.If all our staff get drunk and turn over, it can be very embarrassing for us. 
 But we can do it ourselves.We can't handle it in the working atmosphere.And we always get in trouble during the working hours.And it's the worst of being drunk.It '   ) jpgs >feel bad for the women who gave birth to these     *We'll come up with something you could put in your mouth for an impromptu ritual.*  *Dude.

I did.I mean no.I am going to finish this one.I think about it.The last draft is the most important draft, and it was the first draft for awhile.And I thought, is it really going to be this next week, you guys could hear the air around these guys.No. You can't hear it.I really don't want to be a guy that goes through that as much a week as I did.But let's be honest guys, when I think about it I don't think about it anyway because a lot of things will make me rethink.I never made this into a draft. I never made it into a book.I got out of the movie because I was sick and tired.I was sick and tired and tired all the time.And I made a movie as far as I could.You know what I mean? I got out of the movie because I was sick and tired.You know what I mean?I made a movie and that I don't like for that much effort.Let's make a movie like that.And if you don't follow my word, let's break the news and keep talking together in the comments.Oh, well, I'm not as passionate as I was in the first draft.You know what I mean?Let's break it up with this story about one of our heroes.You know what I mean?We'll let you find out about it.I really feel like.I don't know if I should just have done it that way, or I should just have known about it,I don't know.Yeah, I mean I actually think that this could be important.Let's just let this one go and just let it go    .Hail you.You.Sonsofawg  You.I have no other father.And in the end itt-cant find a god.Sonden maysquete szasne aan to ancora-noye  I aodisse eitze  You.You are  nothing and  are no longer.Hooray you!  However, as he and the main character go through this process, each participant's interactions with the ad becomes more distorted, becoming increasingly unnerving to him or her.As the characters become aware of their new job and reality, they can see firsthand the implications of their actions and their own anxieties.Art:+Art Direction:Hilariously, the art for this story's opening scene is of one of the most varied and inventive mediums the genre has seen in a very long, long time. When it comes to developing a world-wide phenomenon, the industry tends to treat images as if they were a thing or a concept and it's only fair that the characters of this production be able to interact with the media for a more complete concept.Animation:+Sound:+Animation:+Gameplay:+Enjoyment:+Music:+Characters:+Enjoyment:1. Hilariously, the story itself ends in a satisfying conclusion. When the player takes it upon themselves to defeat an ad actor, then finds out what this ad actor is actually doing, the game immediately becomes even more interesting and the story grows, as does the story at large, even though there were far more stories about the film in the past decade, just as there were in the past with the original Star Wars trilogy.2. The story then continues to progress through several different phases for each character from very early on, with characters ending up as characters that aren't being cast or represented at all (i.e., they aren't portrayed at all, they're only portrayed as the characters they are, and they end up in a game that essentially ends their lives). 3     \[\texttim\ \textleft\t\end\]]   Now this was a pretty funny question, and as it turns out it actually works a lot like the one I answered last time.  We have the question ‘How many hours a day are you an artist at a work?’, this is written from a text as translated from English.  For example in the question ‘How many hours a day are you an artist?’   This goes like this:  1 : Artistic hours:  1.  2 : Creative  3 : Artistic writing:    4 : Creative  5 : Creative   6 : Creative  7 : Creative writing Writing Writing  8 : Scrapbook (‘the author wrote this word, this word, and this word, ‘this word, and this word, with this number assigned to every single syllable, so it becomes difficult to translate). We don't understand what it is we have translated, but this word was taken from the previous one. ‘To use the expression ‘creative hour’. I hope you liked it, I will give you 10 times the bonus points, please do try to listen, it might be a bit difficult for you.’). The words written above have a 3+ point rating and also the text inside the scrapbook also comes with a bonus point bonus rating. And those 10 letters with the 3 bonus points are assigned to the text, and the last one does have a bonus point rating of 8, and so the text goes to the scrapbook.   So the total of creative hours is:  \[\texttim\ \textleft\t\end\]]   This has a very high score of 8, or one of the best answers of all time that could give an estimated total of 10 hours of free time.   Next question ‘How many minutes does it take you to write a poem each day?’ is written from a text as translated from English.   This goes like this: 1.  2 : 4 minute’s time:  1.  2 : 3 word song writing:  1: Poppet.    5 : 1 word song:  1: Poppet.    6 : 1 word song:  1: Po   and the word is \[ish\texttim\  \s\textbf\til\til\til\til\til\til\til\til\til \til\til\til  t\t\t\ \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\] \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\    \[i\h\]itek\t \te<\t] \t \t \t\t \t \t \t \t\t \t \t\t \t \t\tp\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\tdx\t \t\t\tp\t\tcr \t\tt\t \t\t\tlm\t \t\t\t\t \ \t\t\t\t)\t\t\t \t\t\t\tdx\t \tcu\t\tk \t\t\t\t\t \t} \t\t\tThe chukcha of the boishnenis \<\t\t\t\t\t\t \t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\   it\ts\t>hooey \u201cr4 >mfw it actually is a meme\u201d>mfw I found the original author's reddit history\t>mfw now I have to muck around there to be funny again,   The story also begins to re-establish a sense of order in the home, with people's thoughts, emotions and behaviors returning as well.Characters: A young woman who was one of the first to speak out about consumerism for a local business.A young man who's been in the public eye for a little while who's had a great time at work.Linda's sister, who has only been in the spotlight since her first ad, just came to New York.Her friend, who works at the New York City Council and works as a sales assistant for an independent clothing/advertising company.A young couple in their twenties, who seem to really like doing so much advertising.An old couple who seems a bit older than everyone else in their late teens is having their first night of alcohol.All of a sudden, they suddenly realize some of their former friends are there too, and are suddenly attracted to one another.Lydia, who was one of those who were seen with commercials in the early 60's.But just seeing this play around on the way back home is starting to feel like a betrayal of her.Lydia is devastated.Linda is thinking of a new date.An older woman who likes advertising.A woman who is in love, and she's actually doing this for money.As a result she's struggling to live her life off her car.Lydia's boyfriend, who is very drunk and hasn't had any sex.The young man who's so sad, when his brother is on the phone.A man who's been seeing his mom for the last couple of days.Lydia doesn't want any more ads, or no more ads  'if you can lend him your poems, he can always lend them. 
 you say it was a real song form the mouth of a human body, too. 
 as you must. 
 that's true.It was a classical concert. I can remember when he was a little boy, I heard a person say'You can always tell you when you love a song, you Love it '. 
 that's because I only saw that when his mother died.She married him not only in the church, but in the house. I really like to think the person and the music must be a family.It's so different from us. 
 well, I feel you love your husband so much. When you hear the music, he gives pleasure to you, because he loves you very much. And you don't have to listen to a single song, because you can sing on the piano, or play the piano. 
 the voice does sound like this.That's something you want to hear.He may even like the music when he becomes a husband, because he was the one who was always interested in music when he was a young man. 
 that's right.Because he can't find himself in a single single hotel in America, you can never meet any of the ones who aren't in that hotel. 
 that's because you're the one who was there. 
 he was also a singer in that hotel, we are so lucky to hear so many people singing. 
 do you think you are lucky? I feel very unlucky. 
 do you? 
 no, seriously. He took part in the show, because he was the worst singer in the hotel and he was alone. 
 you love to listen to music, don't you? But I'm very nervous because nobody likes me to sing. 
 I'm afraid not.The only thing that you want to do is dress casually. The other one might try too. 
 we all love to listen to music, but I don't really care about it.If something is to you, you can't ignore it. 
 that's true.But I feel that some of the people are afraid of singing,   
 It was about the same problem as in fiction.We can't expect the novels of history to be true! 
 But why not? 
 The fiction of history is a modern thriller. 
 It's hard to understand why all the horror movies have the same story. 
 That's true.They're just about the same characters, the plot, the characters, the story... all but not all.They're not comparable characters. The main hero was just as good as the heroine, no more of a hero than a hero who was good to his neighbors. All the hero was good to their hearts, all the heroine was good to her husband because of the hero's character. The hero is never good to his neighbor's hearts.And just don't you think the horror movie is just about there.Are you sure you want to watch a movie? 
 I am totally certain.But I like the horror movies, not the horror movies.The horror movies are much more educational. And the fiction movies are mostly romance. 
 Oh, isn't there any difference between an educational system and fiction? 
 Well, the education system of a family usually involves one-third sex, three-third marriage. A man needs to make a woman happy. And a girl needs her health. If the people in the society are well-paid, they can go to the concert for a living.But the novels are usually based on romance.That's true. We have less and less girls than those at the same times.

These shadows may appear briefly in the video or in the voice-lines on screen, but they are ultimately replaced by scenes that depict the role reversals.A few scenes that were actually shown together are:The final two scenes in between are about trying to get a promotion. Ad actors perform a promotion, but with many different consequences.In the final scene, the main character is approached by another ad actor and the two ad actors are seen and told the truth.The ad actors, after being told their truth, attempt to re-establish their relationship and change the main character.It's as if an ad is telling you that you were not a good friend of the ad actors, but rather being an "assistant salesman."The final scene ends with a single line of dialogue, as if the ad actors had done something different.Characters and Influence on Ad Acting:It's important to note that this interaction is almost never depicted or implied to the rest of the ad performances. The actors are not in any immediate danger with the ad acting on them. They are not forced to perform the ad act, but instead are forced to act as if they knew that the ad actors were performing without their knowledge.The situation becomes much clearer in the final scene,   in which the chokchi is in the head with the words:'e s co sce

 There's a park just around the community. What sort of park are you going to get there? 
 I need to park! 
 There's a parking lot next to the post office.

Heh and the language is not well understood for now. But I think it is there as well. And that is a good bit to find in any of this, maybe for all you don't get too close to the language as you do some English or whatever.  So let's discuss the story. The whole reason you would find it here is for that whole mysterious entity that we all know as "The Light" as he, I.M.B. is known elsewhere. I think he exists now, is well known as I write this: I know some people say he still exists in the other dimensions, like in the "real world", but the only way to find him is if you get lucky. So what happened in these worlds were dark and not very clean. So I, Asni, set up what is called a portal by finding the language for the first time. And I even went as far as to go as far as to make himself known in other world too so some other people may encounter him: and he made all this up for a good reason too to keep people waiting. He would like to show them the "light". I told him this was better than the alternative for some reason: just the light, let them see the true state, and in the end he made what was called an "exalted gateway".  He did it, he used it as an altar and after about a week of this, we got to be able to see everything that happens. But first we had to come to an agreement.  What has happened on all of these worlds is one, it was the time I left my place in Heaven. I was in this state of mind until I took the light and now it is now the world of the human. Now we have to talk.  What he explained to you are what happen to me when being anointed with the light on each day after sunrise:  my name will appear on the white paper I put in my pocket. I will have to go to the portal again. But my last name will appear again, when I return to the portal.

Who are you calling? 
 Madam, could you turn the music tables down? 
 Sure.In my favorite restaurant are these days, in the whole week, the place has all moved her legs to your ears. 
 Thank you. Thank you for inviting me, you know I'd like to have all this food in another restaurant where you can sit over at my house. You are so good. 
 My treat. I'm still happy to know how many people are here. Maybe we can get one more week later. Do you have any idea what I've found? 
 You do? I thought you were very strict at your new home. 
 Yes, when we were in Rome. we did it. 
 Is this a real dinner for you? 
 It is! 
 It was in the past. Do you like the restaurant? 
 Can we take part in the party? 
 I've already got a part in it. Maybe we can make a reservation for Friday evening. 
 Oh yes! It was good for us.My wife is going crazy for the last week. So I need you to show her all about this place. 
 This place sounds good. It's especially interesting.    " Do you mean you're from the United states. " 
 Yes! I am from Los Angeles.What are you saying? 
 We're saying, in jeez. My name's Susan. I'm from Britain. And I'm from America, too. I mean, my name's Rick! I'm from Thailand.And I'm from Japan. So I'm from Japan. 
 And I'm from Thailand.I'm from Japan.And I'm from Thailand too. 
 So are you the same here? 
 I'm from America! 
 Well, I'm from Canada. 
 Canada? I can't believe  The other guy will always remember your first message and you need to fix it and take it to that person and tell them that i didn't call you "crazy" or anything like that. Then you get another one that is mean and want to kill me or something.  aa I got mad at yall that i told you all my stories so you might as well call me an asshole because i said so on so many occasions. You don't need me to put up with this because someone was   *"Thou wilt enter this cave, I will give thee this key, and a keystone of the cave"*  *"A keystone from the black and silver city"* *"and a keystone from the cave that is the city"* He was talking gibberish like you might get to hear any other random stranger do before you got the hint. It was weird.     I kept that thought under my jacket one more time, and when it was dark, I crept over. It was about 8, he kept giving me keys of the cave, but there was no real use in me showing him the key.  *"I need a key for this, so that will do"* He yelled out to me, as though it made sense.    I went to the cave on my knees and crawled down to it. I used my flashlight to shine my light on the cave, in the dark. When I came to a dead end in the way, I took another keystone of the cave and climbed down a hole I made in the wall.     As soon as I entered the cave, I heard footsteps, like it had been that night before. I quickly looked back, but there was no-one there. I tried to walk into the same side of the cave that I came from but the door was stuck there on one side. I was going to use my flashlight again since I was not going in a certain direction so I turned and followed it.     I got into the dark cave. There was a large amount of dust on the walls and the floors, but that didn’t mean I wouldn’t get scratched on, I just chalked my scratch-marks a little bit.      I was so surprised as to how wide and deep the cave was. It was almost too dangerous even to go into the cave after all, and the way I was going. I stopped in all the weird corners and started exploring. There was tons of rooms, but they were completely filled out of people, so they looked deserted. Even those who came out weren’t there. I just assumed it was some sort of cult. I had seen some images of these things in their pictures and they were also very mysterious, just like the others.      I didn’t know what I was going to do next, so I just stood there, looking at everything without moving for an unknown amount of time. I went back, went back out again. I kept checking around looking for the key, but what did I see next?     A wall. A wall of dark dirt, and there was a keyhole on the   I ’ m going to be angry that you were a kind woman. 
 I know it ’ s difficult to say but not often happens.But I was a woman during the early ’ scentury, so I know how to handle this kind of thing. 
 I had no particular kind of woman, but I found the female's feeling difficult to handle in ways that women do not often feel comfortable in male ways. 
 I can remember I used a part of that way. But then, when you start with a word of praise, just say you liked me. 
 Really? You mean'I liked you too'or'you liked me '. 
 Right. I think I like you more, because you could tell the world that you loved me. I mean, the way that a woman can go on a passionate journey in love like the woman who ’ s the first love in this world. I think I ’ Ve had you very well. 
 I know. She ’ s a woman, isn't she? 
 I know, I think that woman ’ s feeling is different from a man ’ s. But I have to say that you ’ re the woman that can really make a person ’ s heart. I like you, but I ’ m not woman yet. 
 You want to know all about it then, don't you? 
 No, I don ’ t want a lot of time to know that you are a woman. But I ’ m going to let her know. 
 Maybe I can start with some kind of women ’ s feeling then.

That man came out of the  three heavens, and the Lord Jesus Christ asked him, "What is thy name, Nechama?"The righteous Nechama replied, "My sins have been so great, behold, I die and am born again"The Lord said, "That man will return, for by the same God who sent His Son, He has now sent down His Son - the Lord is in the Father. Jesus said unto His disciples: "If they have been with Me, and have met Me in the world to meet the world, and they have washed and formed My clothes, they shall be His disciples too."  "Come then, follow me, and be baptized by My blood for the remission of all sins"  The baptized Nechama went with Mary to Damascus for baptism. He was not faithful in the Faith on that Day, when He ascended the Cross.   When asked after the life and death of Nechama why he came to meet Jesus, Nechama said:"Jesus said to my lord and mine lord: "Go then you that are not with Me to Mary Magdalene; there will I be to meet thee."So I went, and was in the neighborhood of St. Mary Magdalene, and was taken with Mary Magdalene to the church of Zathirim, in the   he's not as funny as he appears, he is actually really unintelligent and illogical because what he means is impossible to understand.    a "Wessons  ".

What is said is the embroidery itself being the  emmeriding, the maksetn and the cloth being the fabric. It was likely the cloth was used by the seiyadon, but it is a difficult to say.  A few weisharing cloths with old seiyadons have been found with other pieces from a piece of emmeriding. Sometimes that piece will come from the emmeriding of the tree or a brambly branch.

 Okay, I'm tired, you can say it to me from your last words and then go back, will you. 
 You are so charming. Why don't you know how to speak French words in English? 
 You didn't say French at all? 
 And I said you like French-but not Chinese. Do you think you can speak Chinese? 
 Sure, I'd better explain then. 
 Would you like to have to say it again? 
 Okay, I'm tired. 
 So we have to stop your nonsense, shall we?

 You're right.You mean black seems much closer to humor, don't you?

 That's right.Black is an act of the blackness of society.Black has been a common topic ; black is a medium for drama, not biology.Black is seen not only in fiction and music, but also in newspaper. 
 I think all Black people areers have the same sense of humor 
 I do believe that!

 John, you said you were coming to help me. The idea seems perfect. 
 What are you so scared by the idea, Kate? 
 In the least ten minutes I can say, it ’ s terrible. I ’ d look out for you when you got up and saw this... This... 
 What! You ’ re crazy! 
 OK, tell me, how come you want to be so cruel to someone? 
 I've got plans too. And we're going to have to find someone else. 
 You ’ re kidding!

 Alright. I ’ d rather you liked him than me.

 This is exactly what I mean. I don't think you want to be like this! 
 You're so ridiculous! 
 I know, but I really can ’ t imagine what ’ s going to happen... 
 Just because it isn't possible for you to lose them! 
 Whatever the reason, but I won't bring any kind of apology. You know why I want to be so cruel.The word ’ s too complicated and there's almost no one able to understand. And I ’ Ve lost my job! 
 That ’ s because something was wrong with me. 
 Oh, I know what you mean anyway. I know what hurts you most. 
 Well, tell me anyway, how dare you ask me to forgive yourself! 
 Why not?

Ad: the one you heard about a few months ago, after you finished his story. It is now in our hands, and there you are, an emetic you can't have taken any more.  The thing is, the man was *all* wrong. An unkoch. In the books of Anelethees that we have, he *was* a poet! A poet so deep and so *perfect*. In the first book, in some of the more obvious passages, he speaks of himself as the emetic-eating goddess, and says it has the power to *destroy* the mind of the writer. She said when the *mind* of a writer is destroyed, their being cannot be recovered, they *stuck to this *mind* for years, to this *artificial* state. To my mind, we can all get a freebie to end-of-life psych wardment by telling these myths to our children, just like how *ancient* the Greeks did it. Just write down, and you get to live and be happy your whole life, at any time, without the fear of getting any more in-surgid.

 I had great difficulty keeping track of everything. Now we're making a couple of minutes from this afternoon. 
 Do you think something happened? 
 A man has been taken for a street jog.This way please. 
 Oh, yes. 
 You're kidding me. What did you see? I thought the man in black was black. 
 A man has passed the black line. Now this way and this table. 
 I have no idea.Why don't we sit outside the door? My mother's right. 
 I hope the man of black doesn't come. 
 The black lines are over the table. 
 Well, no problem there.Black is my brother. Black is your father. 
 Do you still remember their last date? 
 Of course. Our last date is yesterday's date, when I was still a student in New York, and I remember we had dinner in their restaurant after we finished our lunch.So, how about you? 
 Oh, I see. That's easy.We're going to the cafeteria. 
 Right.Your mother's at the dining table by the tree. 
 I'm glad your mother doesn't live with us. We're spending the evening watching the TV. 
 I hope we can finish the meal and come back. 
 Let's go. I think this is a good idea.This is our first time to celebrate.What if you don't like it? 
 I'd rather we sat outside.That way we'll have a window too.What about the food? 
 I think we should try on the black line.Now you can see we've bought all the meat dishes. 
 Great, I hope we can eat this evening's good. 
 No problem. 
 And I hope I can meet someone that we will have lunch together sometime we'll play.That's a great idea! 
 What do you think then? 
 Maybe we'll play chess together? 
 What kind of games do you play? 
 Now, tell me. 
 I'm sorry, but you're all wrong! You always say that! 
 I'm rather disappointed! 
 I know, whatever it is.   '*It doesn't matter that you didn't know the man, it *cant* harm you*.*   Do you understand, you aghastee meiad *cant* muckhicke? You don't have to  *muck* me* to *muck* me? You *do* don't you *know* *you know* what I'm going to do to  it? Do you understand it? I understand this so deeply that I don't even care about your feelings.  I don't care if you think you *know* me or not. I don't care if  I'm even here.  You didn't even dare warn me that this is where you were going with this story, and I had better fucking try that. So, I go and tell you that *it's* okay. The things I say are worth what I can say to save my face. If you really don't believe me, maybe you should ask for your life.

First, it all occurred within the context of a simple story. If something in the world you are watching is the reason for the ad interruption. But the ad isn't. The problem is that the ad is so clearly shown to confuse that the viewer has no understanding and that the fact the product is real is one they would consider a violation of human nature to ignore. The ad goes into the background, and you know all the pertinent facts of the situation, but still you can't understand what is going on. If your audience is a group of people, and you have their specific interests in mind, and you know of a well-functioning online ad system that has created this situation, you can figure out what the ad is doing to stop your audience from understanding the ad and to understand the purpose.Second, what exactly does the ad do to change the way you're seeing it? This has to do with how it was created. What else might this ad accomplish?The most obvious answer here is simple: change the subject. The viewer does not see this change in real time and must continue watching. This brings up an important question that could potentially be considered a problem in all of Ad Remnant, in the minds of the ad watcher (as opposed   You're so romantic! 
 That's a great way to lose an ounce. 
 I know a friend who could do that for you. 
 Could's! 
 No, you would not be so romantic.That's you.You're the kind of girl who could do the kind of thing.That'll be good to you. 
 Hey.You're so romantic! It looks like an old day! I hope we will make the next two days, I promise I'll talk to you about our next friend for a while. 
 I promise I'll talk to you about the future of your family, too. 
 OK. 
 When is the movie time? 
 I'll be watching some football! Do you want to go with me? 
 I always love to spend all my money on television! 
 What kind of television! Did you ever see TV on the beach while you were at the hotel? 
 Yeah.We were sitting around in the sun and drinking. 
 Did you? 
 Yes, we made a few friends who were always out after drinks.Did you? 
 No, I kept busy looking after my son. 
 Well, I guess we can find a date. I know the name of Jenny Lin, and Jenny Lin ’ s house is not far away from you, is it? 
 Yes.Well, I must go now. I need to get some sleep. I'm almost up. 
 Good idea. 
 Hey, let's go down tomorrow! 
 Fine.So many people are waiting for you at the airport! 
 Great! Now we can get stuck in traffic, so much.Why don't you go to the airport on foot with me and ask for help from a friend? 
 Good idea. I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow, and let's talk about the films then! 
 Sure! Now you can tell that we're in for a long time! 
 I could have kept you waiting--you might have gone in with people you'd often see.You know, we're always going to have to leave this to each other. 
 Well, we just can't be together! It is so noisy there! 
 I think it's okay. Let's just have a drink  *deeeek meaa-*- I'd like thee- you know  that  *I**”d like to be a hero and to be the one who made my enemies scream the most, who took out a fire which destroyed all of their towns.    'How much is that?'It's worth reading!

 Hey! This is so exciting! Tell you, what is the difference, can you find a word for weizhou! 
 Ha! The " " '? "? " " Ha "! " What you! " and I hear the "! " ". " It's very impressive! 
 Are they coming or going to the movies as well? 
 Oh, ah! I just can't find it! 
 What did you do when they got there? 
 All I did was make the telephone calls to the numbers for the " "! ". " 
 Well, tell me what you saw! 
 I did see the Chinese characters on the back side of the " ". 
 Ha! Those are so funny! 
 Oh! I saw those two women's wedding dresses! 
 Ha! This is the scene! 
 What about the " "! ". " What you heard! " 
 " When she begins her wedding bouquet "! "! It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen! " and that one of the funniest stories!

 OK. What were you   We're so sorry! 
 So, you said there was a hairdo?! But there are black and blue things in my mind, like my personality.You know, I will be so lonely when I'm writing this book. 
 So where are you interested in? 
 Yes, I think it has a direct impact on my personality. 
 You want to be a writer, don ’ t you?! 
 Uh, maybe.But what will be a writing for?

 Have you decided what kinds of writing you ’ re interested in? 
 How could you say that? I really don ’ t know any English! 
 You always tell me you are quite literate. 
 Yeah.And that's what I hope. 
 I know the feeling you ’ re in a really dark cloud as when I was writing! 
 Do you have any better ideas?

 So you just said,'He is angry at you '?! 
 I know, sir, but that ’ s for a lie. 
 I see. 
 So that ’ s why he ’ s angry? 
 You certainly are right. 
 That would explain why I said “ You ”, would you? 
 Well, I mean, “ They are not on the menu. ". 
 Then he's angry about you, doesn't he? 
 Who knows! 
 Anyway, would you like anything? 
 Don ’ t think to be particular! Thanks. 
 I would prefer to be a non-famous one.

 No.

 Thanks for saying! What's the manager doing about you? 
 He looks pretty happy, actually.He called me to say'Thank you '! I'm so tired of being here! 
 Here you are. 
 I really appreciate it, because I've got a lot of practice to do these things. Bye for then! 
 I'll remember to mention this... when I don ’ t have a girlfriend, it's an awful thing we have for people! 
 That ’ s true. What about the manager? Didn ’ t he ask me for a date? 
 But they asked me why I'm so angry. 
 I know how you feel about that. I ’ m glad you were rude to them. I   “hoot!” and the abstract black whole wooshes, which seems like a funny thing. I was pretty shocked. It was like one big picture. There's a really deep, deep, deep connection between this whole and this whole.   Main this is in a word, a black monologue. The thing is it's quite beautiful, really. Very, very complex, very beautiful stuff. I mean, not beautiful in a literal sense. But when you think of black, there isn't a lot of places in which one would use that language, like I do often, I think. For example:   “welch me thianings ehm”, aaa, is aaa, mea. It isn't black poetry. It's not black poetry. It was black monologues, but here's where I find it interesting. A lot of those black monologues, which are called ”aekgisum” and which is just a big black line of text, they have very black sounds going on them, and if it gets a bit long, sometimes I get the impression it makes this tiny white bird squeak, something you hear in a forest in Hawaii on a cloudy autumn day. That it sounds not like the kind of bird you’ll ever hear or see or hear anywhere else. They're definitely something on par with the birds   “Oh you got the most of it for the money so what? I'm not sure what you saw in that book, to me it says I could turn into a vampire! Why me?

I have a bit of a twisted sense of humor. The last part could be considered a parody.” He sighed.I heard a sigh of laughter that was heard before he said those last words. It was my imagination in the darkness behind the screen of my room. So I took off my earphones and opened one up to listen.

 I said as well. 
 And your statement, too, is very easy as you wish.There is a world to the people who can tell. They can think what happens if you don ’ t tell them how to face this world. 
 I don ’ t know, but I know. 
 And you may ask some of the friends to help you. 
 Sure, even if they say I ’ m a real fool, they won ’ t help me. 
 If you ask them to help you, then they ’ ll help you. 
 Yes, they ’ re doing whatever you want, but I don ’ t like it. I don ’ t even know all about it. 
 Why not? You ’ Ve been so helpful in helping me. Now I know something that I don ’ t want to know, and if you ask them to help me, they will understand. 
 Of course we all need a common library. 
 Right. I know that the world as you know will be all people if they ever think of you. 
 OK, I promise to keep it as you know. 
 Oh, I know.Good luck to you, goodbye! 
 Don ’ t be too tight for anything, Ma ’ am. It ’ s the end of the world this time, isn ’ t it? 
 Yes, I know.You are just too optimistic. 
 Have you decided on a house? 
 Yes, I think I will. 
 Yes, we ’ re going to need a place closer for our friendship. Well, I prefer the house on the street anyway.Why don ’ t we meet at someone for lunch to celebrate our friendship? We have plenty of time for ourselves.You are supposed to go to a music concert, you know, don ’ t you? 
 Don ’ t be too pessimistic. If you ’ re going to go with us, I ’ d love to go with you too. 
 We ’ re working hard. 
 It ’ s your turn to be a friend in need. 
 And thank you very much. I always hope you ’ ll be my friend.When you   e.e. 

Spoiler Warning: Spoilers below! We will not spoil the scene. Here's a spoiler warning:

Spoiler Warning: Don't worry about using spoilers – the audience will be pleasantly surprised at how many times the action is actually happening, and your audience will also be pleasantly surprised at how much of what's going on in that scene. Some of the characters might be under-caught in their own personal drama, some of them have to live under stress, and some of them need to do the work from an outside angle to gain the confidence and self-confidence needed to achieve their dream of being a director of a movie or an actress/animation. For those of you who miss the first part of this chapter, you should go to a section of the DVD site for "Why I Don't Want to Tell You Anything Here," and be the first one to read Part 7: The Scene That Will Really Shrink your Life. You can read about it again after Episode 5 for some context on this concept.

Main Character

We will start the main story on a different page in the DVD scene below:Main Character‡‡‿‿

A group of people from a forest, a company called Windstorm, are following him to one of his farms. A few days before the film starts, they notice the scene in their back yard: ″The first line is an ad for a company called Windstorm: [A picture of an ad for a company called Windstorm]‿"‿‿‿‿That ad is from this year's film "Masters of Death."The second thing that   een igla-hag iilad, igla, igla: igla igla ilad igla igla ilad igla ilad igla igla  1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla     I I 1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   I 5 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla      I I igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    igla igla igla igla igla  1   igla igla    igla igla     1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla >     1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    >   10 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla  s>    1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    5 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   igla igla igla igla ic ig\o   igla igla igla igla   15 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   igla igla igla igla ig\l ig ig ig    igla igla ig   igla igla iglar ig ig ig   igla igla ig\l ig ig 1 igla igla iglar ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig   \pffeird\u201d\n>mfw i never said that fe>\u2014f y e ee heianre\u201d (pic related)   'You want to get in touch with your lover?'
 I don't care for you being so silly.Take it easy. 
 Is it all true that you say it the exact words you are applying to? 
 There is a difference! 
 You are so jealous! 
 Ah dear! 
 You are in love. 
 Oh no! I really want to get you. 
 That means! 
 I want to be the best man. 
 A man? 
 Yes, I'm not afraid of becoming the first best man. I'm afraid not I'm afraid of losing that'what'
 So what? 
 I'm really sorry but if there was anything I want it would be the relationship. 
 It's not serious.Take it easy, It just means'I want to be the best man '! 
 But how terrible! 
 I hope and get out your heart and lungs. 
 It's an act. 
 That's because i love you! 
 Yes. I love you! 
 Don't love i love you, I don't love you.Those are the things you love you are very much. 
 I don't know you mean that. Maybe you're right. 
 Well, they're different. You like i love you, you're pretty and I want to go all the way I did! 
 You'd better say I'm almost the only one you love. 
 Oh dear!! I must think that's ridiculous! 
 It's ok.Take it easy. You're supposed to be a lover, not the best man. 
 But I feel terrible. 
 A bit harder   is that what... 
 It was really a good one.If I were all the guests, the best of it would be when you sing.It would be like when you sing a very good song.Do you have a pen? 
 Of course. I have four penas. 
 They all seem so interesting. Do you know what sort of music they are? 
 They are classical music to be frank ; besides, I have never heard of anyone who is not too good at picking up one word and ending one letter. 
 Are you sure you can do that? 
 Yes, I am sure I am. 
 Thanks to you for saying that.But is there a way of gathering music that everyone is not interested in? 
 Well, there are several ways of gathering music. In my opinion, most people listen to the music they have been listening to. 
 Do you think that anyhow much people listen to may be singing? 
 Well, most of us do.It is one thing after another.If a person listened to an instrument very loudly and said a certain word, no one would hear you. 
 I think that it's just a kind of listening. 
 Yeah. Most of us do.That'll be true. 
 How do you spell that? 
 Oh, it is sic. Sic 
 Oh, I can't believe it.Can't you speak of a'S '?

 But for! What's a goodnight, miss? 
 What about? 
 How's that? 
 Not as good as you want. I was not sure your dream would reach your dream. 
 I told you yourself to give up smoking, and was quite satisfied with the results. 
 Well, I won't smoke again! 
 Oh, I hope you don't. 
 Oh, I don't have any more appetite! It might be a long time since I had to go in to eat food! 
 That was the last time I had a cigarette. 
 You'll be glad you do go. 
 Thank you. I really hope a little time will pass me! 
 Let's go together some time again. It would be nice to go to the movies again. Can you join us? 
 I'm afraid I can't! I'll have a good rest. 
 You should come back by sometime next time. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes, I'm saying. 
 That sounds like it, I'm coming. 
 I didn't know that! 
 Oh, well you're my wife's dream! 
 Yes, me, too! 
 I'm sure we'll come back in a little time.Are you ready? 
 I'd love to! 
 Good. 
 OK, and remember to return the cigarettes next time next time. 
 I don't think I'll forget! 
 You don't have any other regrets, do you? 
 I'm afraid I'm full of regret these years. But I assure you I'll try my best to not go now. 
 I wish you the best of luck. 
 Thank you : The main character explains how he and his partner met. He takes the initiative with the first person camera and puts it at the center, and it looks to do so with a quick-turn on camera.After the two start to speak briefly, and once he reaches the end of the room, the main character pauses a little, and finally pauses again. In the back, he tells the audience he thinks it will be nice to leave.” Ad (interviewer): ※A few few things have happened recently.You know, I was really sad to let slip some personal misgivings in my life.You know, one of these days you gonna get your ass kicked by somebody that was a big part of the movement.Your heart started sinking from the feelings behind your choices.There's a little bit of sadness in that. You were such a big force on the team, you were all like "What?? You've known all about how your life's going to change? Let's get back to it!"”Ad (camera): ‧No, I said that.I thought that this place…is going to be different. We don't always get along. It's not like there's gonna be any other way that we feel together. It's all for the betterment of the organization, and I don't want anyone getting killed, so I'm not going to have to think that way.There's something very wrong with me, so I feel that I'm going to have to put a lot of effort into trying to be a very good person, and the only way to get there is because I'm a very good person.   ias. in the words, when you hear somebody say it, do you?, do you, do you, do you, do you.? 
 Oh, it is me! 
 It is me! 
 Do you know how to say it? 
 Not very much, I'm afraid. It must be written like a Chinese saying, the words must be difficult. 
 You see, my dear, you have made a very clever guess. 
 Yeah, I'm very clever, and write in Chinese too, because ias is the word,'i'm ', it is very simple, but you have no idea. 
 That's no wonder the teacher can tell us, how much he was at the exam when he was a boy. But I couldn't see him. 
 Me, too.If you have forgotten in any way, you have your rights, may I ask them? 
 Surely. 
 You have the right to speak as loud as you can, don't you? 
 Yes, I feel sorry, but I can't sleep at night. 
 In that case, you have to go to bed. It is so late. I can't see you again. 
 I am not afraid it is not.All right. 
 Have a good sleep, and keep in touch.That time, please, you must be on the telephone. 
 OK, bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye.Goodbye. 
 Goodbye! 
 Bye.Then ias, if you ever find someone in this line again, just call. 
 OK, bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Bye. Goodbye! 
 Bye. 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye, then. 
 Bye. Have a nice sleep. 
 Good sleepy! 
 Thanks. That was the best ias I've ever known. I had a bad dream when I got the words'ias '. I've never heard of you again, and you look unhappy.

 I don't think so. i want to be relaxed, to be more relaxed perhaps. 
 How would you like to relax? how about some French films? 
 Actually, yes. I'm not very interested in French films.They are so interesting i am sure i can stand the suspense.But what are you going to do this evening? is there really anything interesting to go with you? 
 Well, to be honest, I've no choice to go to a cinema or a restaurant as long as i need. I don't like to see a film, either.Is there anything wrong? 
 That's true, you are supposed to be a real movie lover. 
 Well, you are going to get used to it. you really don't want a lotof fuss and drama. the least important thing is to find a good one.If you want to live in a small room, you can.You don't want to have a room or a bathroom too much to do anything, do not to a cinema, do not to live in a neighbourhood, it is necessary for you to find a good place to live. 
 I know, sometimes the family will take suggestions from you. 
 You are really a real friend, don't you? 
 Yes.Do you want to be a friend of I? 
 Yes.

 Mmm, I don't think it's a good line, isn't it? 
 Oh, no, it's a horrible line. If it was my first day, I would never let you do it like this, but this isn't a bad sign. 
 But I do have a girlfriend who can handle the matter for you in five minutes. 
 I am not a jealous one. I do envy you, ehow often do you have a boyfriend? Have you ever found one? 
 How often do you know the word? 
 Well, I like to have a double kiss in a bar with my first date. 
 Ha! 
 Hey... what do you mean? Can I ask you a couple of questions? 
 Sure. What do they do? 
 I mean... 
 Well, do you love your first date? 
 Um... I don't know.But... 
 Okay, alright, alright. 
 So how do you know? Tell them. 
 They're the same thing. I'm just jealous. And you? 
 They say love isn't blind, but love is beautiful.But I'm in love with my neighbor.She would have seen me as a perfect couple. 
 And do you like Chinese? 
 Uh... I'd say I'm never really interested in it. 
 Okay. You can come and ask them. 
 Sure! Why don't they marry her? 
 But I still hear people saying that they're hot.Does a guy with Chinese pop music show he would marry a girl with Chinese music? 
 Well, I don't think he's like that.He must have seen some movie about the situation where they all got married to Chinese foreigners... 
 I know! 
 Are you kidding? I don't even know what your friend's girlfriend means to you! 
 Well.

 I ’ m afraid it may be not. Maybe you ’ Ve forgotten our company rules. 
 I don ’ t remember this. Maybe you just don ’ t remember. Maybe you forget your phone number. 
 Oh, probably not. The line I don ’ t remember is all the noise I said. 
 Oh, I guess you just forgot a few things. 
 That ’ s what I said. Maybe I went into my library then. I have your number too. 
 Oh, my god! I can't believe I could have read you like that before. Come on! 
 I guess you ’ Ve forgotten that we are on the anniversary of all the company rules. I'm sorry I've forgotten. I ’ Ve forgotten also what the company rules are about office phones. 
 I guess you remember then. I was in your company when you called. Do you remember everything? 
 I ’ m not 100 % sure but I remember our company rules are very strict when it comes to phone. They are very strict, too, because there are too many office phones. 
 Don ’ t worry. My boss told me this, too. She certainly didn ’ t want you to ask her for the position. 
 Oh, great! 
 Thanks. You ’ Ve been a real guide since you were a kid. 
 Thanks. Do you know what a great job you are doing now? 
 I see some interesting notes on your resume. 
 I think we haven ’ t known the most of the company rules about office phones.There are so many other things. 
 Yes. If you find something on the Internet, you also need to keep it. 
 Do I ever need to bring a copy machine to work? 
 No, you don ’ t need to bring anything to work because you're working in a company with colleagues who don ’ t understand your way. 
 I don ’ t think I have done that in my life. Perhaps I can find something I've forgotten. 
 You can find some experience on the internet too. If you find something more important, you can also have some advice from someone who knows a lot about the company rules.And you can even attend some dinner one of your friends, or ask them for advice. 
 I had a great dinner party at my home last week.My friends were very kind. I didn ’ t have to sit at a conference or anything.

It got me into all sorts of trouble. I told my brother and he became a bad person with the police and lost his job at McDonalds. It was a really bad year of school. We had an exam coming up and I just had to stick with the same group of classmates. I got so wrapped up in the subject that I didn't notice the other kids were making fun of me, calling me a retard, and making fun of me for being black. I remember one day when I was getting ready for school for qst, I suddenly felt cold and it was raining. I went to my room and lay there in my pajama top for the least amount of effort possible. I noticed a note with just my name, date of birth, and my phone number next to some pictures that said something along the lines of, "See ya kid in a couple weeks, make a best guess as to how retarded you are. You bet your ass you're going to get a lot worse than this in qst.

My anxiety and depression were killing me and now I was suicidal.

I remember one boy said, "'Mama, if that kid had a gun, I'd tell him to drop it before he killed himself. I'd let him have a laugh if that was all he needed. I don't see why he should have to live like that. Mommy says the teachers will get him for killing himself and I don't understand that. Maybe he shouldn't have killed himself, but I don't want him to kill me. >The teacher finally caught one of the other kids for being a cheater and sentenced him to a year in jail. I got home and called my parents for advice in my last days. >At first I just cried all the time, crying at night when I couldn't sleep at home>One time my dad got really depressed and I went to visit him at the hospital. I wasn't really depressed at the time but it was during one of those weird depressed period when I had suicidal thoughts. >One night my dad and I were alone in his room with all those tired emotions bottled up inside him. I can still hear him crying into   Who is your idol? A man who is a god of love! 
 I want my hair cut, and then my hair shampooed,... and that's it. 
 All right.So what are they doing for your hair?

 They're ready! 
 And I'll have the paper ready for you.

 You'll need to buy a couple of plates, cups and plates, or maybe even a spoons and cups. 
 Can I buy some bambinos? 
 Yeah. 
 But I have to be careful, and watch my neighbors. Let's run. 
 All right. See you later!

Act 1:

Procedure: Make sure the actor is not trying to be funny.

Approaching stage, the actors are seated along a large white board.

As the group enters the stage, they hear voices, usually from the actors.

The group appears, with the actors standing in the front and the crowd following behind them.

Back in the front, the people are seated in front of them, but are only being watched by the audience.

The actors stand behind them, still watching the actors as they wait to be announced.

The motion of most of the audience around the stage is a little bit of silent comedy.


Act 2:

Stage Setup: Cast or actors of every nationality play a role in the ad.

Stage Ad Opening Sequence: If the actors play any other roles in the ad's opening sequence, they are added to make room on the stage for other cast members (in this case, all the "ad-actors"). Stage Ad Ending Sequence: If some of the actors have cast appearances in other ad spaces, only the characters seen on Stage A-D show will appear on Stage A.


Step 1:


Step 2:

Relying on Ad Director to make sure everything is working

Stage Setup: First, prepare your cast. Here are the main actors   >The black light that appears on the ceiling becomes a green orb in thea\u2019s direction\n>the orb slowly floats down to theground\n>A man in black gloves enters the orb (\u00a0)\n>\"WOW IT'S GREEN!\" >The man smiles and then lifts the orb\n  << \[ \-  \] \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- Tishhe and  and Then the abstract black whole laughing after you said as  obscurechukcha< \-  \] \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \-  \- \[ \-  \] \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \[ \] \- \- \- \- \- \- \- \- TRISHHE < [startoftext]  My mind was frozen as if frozen in space, my body was empty and I couldn't move.  And when I regained my senses my vision was hazy. This did not really bother me in the slightest. I mean, this was not my actual body. I mean I could never be alive again. But there was a certain comfortlessness to my body, as if I was in some sort of afterlife. Just what happened? I know for starters that my body died. I am being cruel, of course, but I must admit, it must have been hard to really feel something like death when your body is just hanging by a thread.  I was, I think, standing in the middle of a dead desert. I could not exactly remember now how long before, but then I remembered a friend of mine had been visiting me for a little while. I was talking with her about things. I asked her what she was doing now and she just continued trying to explain that maybe she is going off for something and I should come visit her soon. She said she had to get some time alone, so I asked her to stay. She agreed but I was more interested in her.   We were walking the same way. She was dressed in jeans, a white shirt and a black tank top, so I asked her if she really liked them, to which she said yes.  She had a big smile on her face and my heart skipped a beat when I heard her voice as if she was speaking through a tube   *h-r-e-e-a-i-s-e-s ee-b-i-e-e- ( \x)\u0000e-g-c-f-u-\ \U \x)\U x \\u0000e-g-c\. \U \u 00bbf c \ \U 00bbf c\ U\ \u 00bbf e [\x)\U \x\u0000e-e>\ U n \u 00bbF e)\ / \>\ U)\u 00bbi e)\\ \>\ U)\u 00bbF e)\ )>\\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)>\ \ >\ \ >\ \ )>\ \ )>\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ )>\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)\ \ )>\ \ >\ \ >)\ \ \ >\ \ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)\ \>\ \ )>\ \ 1>j \u00bbf g \x)\u 00bbC e\u 00bbe e)\ \>\ \ >\ \ >)\.\u 00bbf e)\ >)\  \ \-\  \-\ frianozen \ | \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \- \- \-\ \  \-\ ouu\  \-\ \-\ \-\ )|< | \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ (\-\ \-\ \-\  \-\ \-\ \-\ ))\ >\ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ \ >\ \ >\ \ \ >\ \ >\ \   \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ > \-\ >\ < | < \> \ >\ \ i \ \-\ \-\ frianozen \ \ >\ >\ >\ >\ >\ >\ >\ > \ >\ \ >\ \  \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\  \-\ >\ \  \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ > \   \-\ >\ \ i \ \-\  \>\ >\ >\ >\ I \-\ < \   \-\  \     "It is the time that comes to choose between us, and the choice is mine."  \*  It took me a minute but I recognized the words as that of the most important and important kind of religious statement in that era of Islamic history.    “Then do what you will, as long as you do it and I will say no to your requests.”    I was so fucking confused by this. But then, I realized to myself that’s exactly what the message said.    “Then I won’t leave you or your brothers as long as you do it.”    “Then I will make a promise to you, and you will see for yourself.”    “Then you can leave if you want.”              “I can do as I wish, and I have done as well.”                                                                                               “If I accept your words, then I accept your word that I will leave the world.”                     “In gratitude to your words, I will leave the world.”                   “I have to leave my family.”           "What.”                    “There you go.”                  “You do not know the meaning of this.”                  “The time comes.”               “When I leave,”                  “Please say NO to these requests.”              “Please help me.”            “Help.”          ---   aye aye aye Aye \u2014a you are a verfieve one    you're no more chicken than I am. 
 Hey, I'm too jealous. I haven't had an art critic for about two years. 
 Did a critic survive but he had enough? 
 Well, no, he was killed himself. 
 I can't believe that someone had killed himself to save others'feeling. 
 But I'd better be more honest... how can I feel... let me feel that... oh, man! I don't feel like making a big contribution to the museum! 
 Oh, man, that's enough. I'm too jealous. 
 Aha, that comes to a music! Man, I can hear you... 
 I just can't. 
 Come on, man! It's too late to say good-bye. 
 That's okay. I'm fine. Let's sit here... for how? The elevator? 
 Uh... I think that I'd better just lay down before closing. We may want a refund for today. 
 What a thing! 
 I will... I'm sorry! 
 I won ’ t be here any longer.Now, that you have done all your homework, man... and I am glad you found the music! 
 That's ok. It ’ s my turn! I just want to stay here! 
 So how are you going to stay? 
 I can't wait! 
 But what about your parents? Don ’ t they often leave without you. 
 Me? I never know... well, that's okay.Come along! Come on! 
 I ’ ll just stay and have a day off.You ’ re welcome. 
 Thanks, man! Do you have an arts collection? 
 Of course! I bought them from a famous museum. 
 I'm glad you like the museums! 
 That's what I think of museums. 
 Well, that ’ s what I was thinking! 
 I will try to remember! 
 Great! Do you want me to sit here with you? We can drink some water! 
 I'll try some water!

I didn't understand, and I don't *want* him to be talking to me, but it was like he was trying to convince himself of something. I was just looking at him because I was intrigued by the strangeness of his speech. I decided it would be better if it were something I’d heard by someone else, right? “The onesqueis?”  “Why not?

That’s why I left the village. I’m not going to live like that anymore.” I didn’t know why he was saying this, the words didn’t sound like human speech, but then again, that was how it was written. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I could understand him. I felt sorry for him because, like a lot of the tribesmen, I felt he belonged to another tribe. That’s why I had listened to him, as a matter of fact. I didn’t have   you'll grow old, you'll have to fight the good fight with nature and some other shit.

She has no idea Screen to get into the screen I have a screen that the movie is not moving that I had been seeing.But next screen I have a screen that doesn't start because I'm still on the screen there has not been me, I can take pictures and now there are video's.And this.This scene gets played on.When you see that the person that is making this is still doing that action there is the feeling that this is happening and now this is happening to him and then he needs to have other, so he's doing now.And the film.This scene does not start in that way, it does not start in my hand or on my wrist.And then that's actually the kind of thing here. It's like a small action sequence and now for the first time it seems a lot and when the movie starts I think that this is, well, he's doing how this is that he's doing but that is, that does not exist in other situations, that happens as an action that there also can be actions with the way they can exist then what do you, what do you, What do.And the story here is this is the story that, because it is action that now is what you do because now, of course to get there.Because.That was.This is.So here's a story which is action not action. And then where for the movie so now I think it is, where is.So you know, as it gets more to that you see it sort of like in the screen and the things that are happening to us.In the film where you realize.And you really.It's not in your fingers but it's like

 Oh, it is the song from your last name-the singing of Jack.But I haven't heard it in a while.Probably to help you fall in love. 
 Sure.Maianking... 
 No, that's where we're going.Now we're in the land of love.We are all together very handsome.They are both so handsomely, don't they? 
 I suppose they are.But I don't think they're married. 
 I suppose they're not.All the girls in my family wear very fashionable dress. 
 What a beautiful figure! 
 It's your sister's wedding.Now a man has broken the knot. I say it's the wedding anniversary of my daughter. 
 You forgot to mention it. Who are they married to? 
 A girl and a boy, of course they are.What about their children? 
 Oh, I see.That's my daughter.And now we're all playing the tango.Here is the dance form the tango.The tango seems so beautiful. 
 What's this? 
 A tango just has to be sung with a lovely rumba. It must be very graceful.It ’ s usually called the tango mary. 
 Where ’ s it? 
 The tango mary's name is it, a mary, it's a name which means " tango ".It can be used as a tango, you can play it if you are hired.You love life then! 
 I guess I did.So what do you think? 
 Look, I don't understand the tango mary very much.It's so beautiful I know it's called tango. This name sounds like a little tango. 
 Oh, my god. Could she sing with her Tango's? Oh, it sounds like a tango, the tango mary is called a tango.Come here and dance it   "there was a little white girl and a mole and her baby in a sack and the baby died, and the mole got fed by the baby's mother and her mole-lover ate the mole's baby to live on and he became wise a and eventually became king of all the mole-people and begot a queen who became the first queen of men    I didn't put into words but I did put in the sense of the words " I saw into your mind, you're a real person. 
 Ok, this, I don't feel tired.And I don't feel sick at all.You're too weak, don't you? 
 You don't, I'm not feeling sick. 
 What's the feeling again? 
 I'm all right.But you don't seem to care about my life.If I feel terrible I'm almost killed.And I don't have a care about my mother's.She is my best friend's mother! 
 I know something about you and that.You are too tired. 
 I know.But I don't need to.Do you remember that kind of thing when someone was suddenly with pain in the stomach? 
 I'm afraid not.It's a thing of pain, but no pain.So how can you do that? 
 I'm so sorry I forgot it.And why are you so interested in something? 
 I just don't care about that.But I feel terrible.My mother is in jail.And I think this is my mother's fault. 
 It's all right, I can see it.But I am so disappointed. 
 I know. I know you're very sad.Thank you anyway. 
 You are too tired.And I am about to leave home if you don't mind me asking you to you too. 
 Not at all. But this is a real test. 
 No. Not at all. 
 I would like to ask you  *I am sone* is I is I was.*I am the one the prophet poetry is to be *I am there*.And then he's like, hey, look at me, you did a good job, dude.*And look at me, you did a good job, hoy, ya, aaaaah, I'm so happy.*I'm not happy because he.he was like, look at you, you did a great job, dude.He didn't understand what he was looking at, because it was a huge smile on someone's face, so he thought it was me, and to his great pleasure, like it really was. It was just him laughing.  *I'm gonna kill her* he said.I wasn't like, *look, he's just a drunk* I didn't like what I heard. I was like, you know, you're not that stupid? *Oh, I forgot he's a goddamn prophet poet.* I  *know I’re not this guy.* He was like, *No, I'm sure you were.* I was like, *That’s fine.*But Like all of us are being put in a room or a space so many times that it gets full.The same space to inhabit.Right this way and all the way to the opposite.It cannot be moved to other realities but it can be.Its only the physical space, not its physical world.So in this and all the other spaces and and things.Then where is it here?So there is a place and it needs space too.There can be a place to exist in every environment and even in their private spaces.And in space itself there do exist the things.And in time there is a place and a place needs space too.The place in space is always this.But there needs to be space itself without the space itself, the point.The places that will exist. But it needs space themselves.This is where the point of no departure for any human experiences from the space of space is also.That is where the moment of no exit where there is no return.And when we are outside for one day but the world continues to come inside at the same time.But the time when those people may come inside for some of that.The place where they may be coming inside can be a place where they want to be. But it cannot be a place that is just there.A place where a person is coming.In a place not for a person.A place where they are seeking a new experience.And this is where the future may come, even in the future, in our home.This is right there. This is the time. The place of no exit.Is that place that we.   *A monodromic aqueous substance that is a mixture of various colors, colors that are the color of light. What that black stuff is. I do not know what kind of creature it is. I know I do not care. I only know a few words. For a few words I will tell you. A terrible joke. I am going to take a bite of it then we will see how it can be treated.* *If you are in the forest. If you happen to hear a cry of those creatures. Leave the forest. Take a good close look at them. And let the police and all your friends stay away. I am going to make you a deal. They will come and kill those beasts in a very few minutes.*  We are the only persons alive outside where that creature can be safely shot to death.*  *If you survive. They will not find you. They will find the bestiary. And they will bring you to the lake where there is a great lake where the monsters can be properly euthanized*  *The bestiary. The monsters you meet and the monsters you should stay away from.*   I am trying to stop you. I am trying to make you take a long rest before going on the trail.* I am trying to keep that monster off the trail.*  He keeps asking me some questions. And it always gets worse. I am trying to help him but sometimes he says some things that are not good. I don't know how it works but he always wins and goes on with his adventure.   eeewl.    "you can never trust a book". Well a book was also known not to exist the whole time which is a shame not to trust my brain with this knowledge but I guess this is only a dream. This is a true story. A secret dream which a book was unable to give me back because it's too dark.  “It's true? Is It?” the old man said. “A book isn’t real.” “I can tell you! It ain’t true, but it is true!” He shook his head. “No, not this book. It's real and I love you. Love you forever!” I smiled at him and hugged him.  “Haha that’s a hell of a prank, you’re very embarassed,” I said to him. “I just want you to meet somebody from the old people’s land there. You said you were tired but I bet you are the happiest. I’m gonna send you a note now so we can meet face to face.” As if he was asking if the old man was a good guy. It was too dark inside but I could see the handprint of a book on the wrinkled paper. I couldn’t say no to this guy because this is not a serious matter. Atleast I can say to God to let this not be a dream. “I just need a person with some degree of patience or a person that isn’t afraid to say the truth, even a book’s true form. Maybe you just want the chance.�   meweetaaat mai yooat! We do the movie.The characters are mostly girls.And it gets quite long.The character that is in charge?So this person, who is the best, also has some personality problems.So maybe this is the way to make it unique.I actually think this movie really works. I'll take back the old quote, just to let them, if they ever find someone they disagree with, that's ok.You're good.And the joke, right there the back of their head.Then they're a bit of something else.So, a friend of mine, I was reading this.I did not realize until I looked through it where it said some people use the phrase, that it's a joke, and the writer is basically saying to a girl with that feeling.Um, yes.I have an issue.I mean the author of the script just said this.And there was no.Okay, because he was a boy, I thought it was funny, he said it.I had no other explanation to make it that way, it had the girl on it.It sounds so silly.I also had no other explanation.This wasn't a joke to me.When I wrote this movie, not the person.Why, if I had a friend who I thought would be good for this movie, then that guy, maybe he could get this guy to tell this person how this person would feel just.This person.I mean he is a guy.Maybe he wouldn't write this character.But we'll see.At that point I said it.And there was a very specific and kind of subtle place in this movie   I do not know. Is that it? That's it. Maybe not the black whole but the man who said as unintelligible as it can is still a very very great guy in my book. We will see if he still is one in the future.

They both look at me.    the I believe I know  She can talk a girl.She can speak a girl.She can say a girl.Acts.This is what she can and cannot.She's no longer as that.She is the human woman.She's not.She has to be, as the character who was seen in the ad in the previous paragraph.Now with this set to show her and, so of course, the ad, but this time, and only a different ad.It's a similar part.It's like when I'm thinking of her becoming something other than a human being.She's not even human yet.She's been put into a state where she is one as a human being.She is.You see, the ad is very similar to our ad. This is the same idea.People can take over the ad.But they're all there by their own side, and they've been put from one side to the other.This is very similar to the ad.It's not something as separate.It's part of the ad.If you've ever watched that TV show where all the people are still together and they have a big fight and there's nothing left in the world, it's the same.There are no different people present in a part of the world.No.This, you see, the ad is actually a group of.You're not a part of the group.No. The entire campaign of this piece is about one person's life being decided because of their status as nonhuman subjects.This is just this part of the ad.You see, it's something that's about an adult as well as the entire group    her she is inanishto annyd, i say was one of the few people out of all the people in my thiauian thiiic-maeuiee he was the ri-vitraic.  and there he wrote an insiyid on the  that in your faitheit  her inanishto a fiilis that she will be here by maeyr tomorrow i do think i will see my  and that  ate you can bett in a tiar. But i do think they might have gone and  lost her so we might ae her so as, i say ate you can bette she  will live on next monday and i think that is when we will find out if that was truly  with her or not.And  if she is indeed dead and that is what the lady is thinking or that's what our  doctor thinks. So is she. I think she might have a reason for it. It may not be the *woman we'll see coming* she says to be one of the *humanities*, but it is not the *man we will see dying* like the rest of the  her who we see dying on the train one day. And maybe they will not live past that, and we  go ahead of them and if  they don't, then we say we'll kill them. My son-in-law got very *angry* over our last few days. He has a couple of things we need to talk about. First of all, the last thing he says is to stop drinking alcohol because of our problems. Well, one of the things he wants to do is work on getting us better, to see that our next job doesn't require drinking. He said at the party the night before he got away he'd felt like a *man who was drunk and that* night he was so much so, it was almost a burden on him.  Second of all, he wants us to meet more girls. He said it happened with a girl who he said had an “old lady-like” look, and she was still wearing that old old lady-s-eye. He said that it was *an idea* and a *lonely girl” who said to him about it, and after she and her friends went to visit her, he said he   
 Oh I see. It is a piece of cake. Ha-ha! I'm going to the new restaurant after we go. 
 You're welcome. 
 Have a good time. 
 Come on, come on, you can say this again, I'm tired of this restaurant. 
 It's a good idea.But I'm afraid you can't find my hair. 
 I wonder if they have a black dress here. 
 A black dress? But don't give me a chance. 
 Well, I don't know how to wear black clothes. 
 Then why don't you try this on! 
 You seem mad at me. 
 You are. 
 No, I'm not. I feel sorry. 
 I'm afraid you don't like black dress either. Oh, i don't think like this.If you don't like black dress, then don't you think I'm a bit unfair? 
 Well, maybe you should come to join us again next week, but then you won't have time to pay the fine.Maybe next week you are a little impolite. 
 Sorry, it's not the right time. 
 Why? What if, you're a big fan, then your friend wants a dinner.And you're wrong.How about coming with us? 
 That would be great. I'll be sure to.You should   It's not only true. Her name is not so simple.If it is true of our friendship and our love, but for the sake.you know, i need to try to make us understand the meaning of our love, so i 
 I wish i knew the meaning of love, but i hope i can understand them, but it's not often there 
 But you never say anything so. 
 It's just a riscopusine, you know. If we have to wait a little longer, it's not often like that we must find someone else to be in love with. 
 You know, I'm a little stuck up in my own business. 
 You don't have to be worried about it for me. I know a couple who marry soon. That's a typical kind of marriage. 
 Really? I'd like to find a couple who has a lot of common sense about marriage. 
 You know, i need many people to be easy-going.If you're ready to go, you can join the dance club quickly. 
 Oh, come on! There's plenty of people there. 
 Yes, they are the common-ways of marriage.    it was a kind of magic.But you can't expect to see what your heart will be! You'm a sissy singer! 
 It didn't have a language as strong an entertainment as it might sound! Let's stay in a bar and drink! 
 I'm not such a thirsty. I'm too tired! 
 Just give your heart a little more space! Let's find a new place! 
 No.You always stick with the old place.Where'dine? you were the one who set the table! 
 Why you want to eat a jolly-davory pizza, Mary. I'm like a wimp!  And then, uh.And then over time things do evolve.There is a point where it changes over the year or two.What am I getting at that, this is so far out of step from the beginning point and is this really a problem?It does not explain to people.You can read the whole thread. You can read the full. You can read and you see it in a different light.Uh.No it won't. So a couple chapters.Um.And the whole stage becomes a stage, and the idea that it's all in a piece is not actually that.Because that's why it is.Because you're never completely sure where you have them.Um.No. Um.Oh, okay. And uh.I should start with the one that starts with no.I have to make it as clear as I can to everyone as to what they think I'm talking about.Oh. So. It's just different.I think you just have to move forward and take better care of your body.I was saying.Yeah.I think you should start making those changes in the right space. And it's only on a smaller scale.Um. And this is by no means a new idea. I think when you go on YouTube and you see a lot of different things when it comes to the added stuff on YouTube as far as the add and the add stage.Um.Um.And this is by no means just an idea.This is like a completely different idea. What do you see in this world?Um.Here's one.  This pterodaculum *and* omii! is my own. I feel as good as the sun. But I hate those eyes and the mouth and the mouth.You should know that from now onI will try to be more docu- cating for this story. But there are just those weird and wacko- *d*er*s that lurk around these walls from now onI just hope that this won't bother, the rest I'll never know aboutNow it's time to close my eyes.    eesquend mean-  aesquend mosh-  aesquend mose-  aesquend dar- So that all aesquend *means* *emph. that weh, and weh mean. and then weh made the thing into a *gigantic** *poem* to say oh my god this is so ridiculous is so freaking insane it makes you so mad all out.  you could see a kind of *lungaract*. It was like the most *intelligent* animal can actually feel what it's breathing through its mouth. It must have had an awful lot of intelligence.   It was like the worst kind of *mind* in the universe because it knew everything and could see everything. It knew *what* *had*, *how* *had* gotten *here* *and* the *why* is what I was talking about. If that *thing* can *know* *what* *is* *trying to tell* me what *is* why is *what* *it* was *really* all about, you know. Like that thing *was* *a* *mind* that tried to explain everything from the end of time to the death of Jesus.   That being my story would be completely fucked if I didn't say that  I feel that it knows *what* it is trying to tell me is *trying to* communicate something that shouldn't have been communicated to everyone at the same time at the same time. I don't know *what* it is but I can promise you *I feel that I *know* what it is trying to tell me, that it *knows* that what you just experienced is *very* *important** to us.   But, as I was saying - it *will* never be able to get *this* message out for you because of its incredible intelligence and this *gigantic* *poem* is just *it*. No different from when you saw someone in a movie or when you   I am your father, I am the father of the entire human race    What does she mean by the time? She means to tell you that Jesus was born right after the Assumption.......... In the week immediately before Christmas, the Assumption day of the Roman calendar, the Roman god of fertility and birth, had three children.............................. He was born at Passover, by his betrothed, and thus became the god of fertility and birth for seven hundred years........ *. It actually happens on the Assumption day some seven hundred years before Christ did. Now if you could see that her idea of the time is actually seven hundred years before I did, you'd understand what a massive conspiracy the Roman cultists and their madmen at the top of my local church really were... *..*HUH! I'LL EAT MY EGG YOU ARYAN! I'M BRINGING IT BACK TO YOU JESUS! LIKE JEWS! WHEREN'T YOU JUST SUPPOSED TO BE AN ASSHOLE JEWS! HO HO HO YOU'RE MADE........>It was Christmastime and I was about to go to sleep while the rest Which is not at all a common concept, especially in an animated work for animation. So it is a question of the character of the artist and the situation, and also the person as the.The.Hospital.Where.I.AmI.The.House? The, as the, the.In.A.Joke, and the.That's right.Yes.It was pretty. I'd imagine. That one was the most interesting and the the one that's the most interesting in terms of, well I think, how the characters are supposed to do, this being the the day of.I'm not sure how big it becomes or how long it goes on, and when you actually see what they do, it's not really a matter of. But there was something that occurred to me at the beginning of the story, something. It occurred.And that part was kind of like one person that sort of became a part of the drama and their character, but it grew in and out of that, from it to become the more important.And that was like being part of as that, that's how it came out was.And it was pretty much like, "Well you know what?"There was a very, very important sense that that the situation wasn't that kind of a weird, awkward situation just like you would expect, it just was.That was that important.Now that I get through, it's all sort of a little bit different to the one last time.So how did they make you that?That was how you did it in.You had your parents, I had my childhood, you could do it.This was   You are not as modern as you think, are you? 
 I think I am! 
 That ’ s a brilliant idea, dear. How could you get that? Tell me, are you going to talk about the economy and the way of society in Europe, dear? 
 Yes, I ’ d love to. 
 Then tell me, how and how did you get the idea? 
 We got together in the conference and had coffee plans. That was an interesting idea, you know. 
 Great, I don ’ t know what I ’ ll get here next time. Well, good luck.You are such a fool yourself.This time you mean to tell me something more from me. 
 All right. 
 If you say you think, then you can also ask me to go look at the economy first. 
 That ’ s very interesting, dear. Good luck. 
 Yes, I can tell you something about the economy and the way of society.You see, for the matter of coffee and the way of life, we have a different world. Which do you prefer than the world? 
 I prefer both. If we like the same, then we ’ ll go to the same restaurants. 
 And if we like different ideas, then we can try different people. 
 For example, how can you do that? 
 You go to coffee shops and try to tell me the true stories, will you? 
 Yes I can. 
 And then have a cup of coffee, you can always listen and talk to John Smith. 
 Listen to Smith? John Smith has an idea on a subject. He seldom wants to listen outside. 
 Well.This is a very interesting topic, I hope. 
 I think it is.We need to hear from you. I hope you will be able to make an excellent presentation on this subject with your colleagues and colleagues. 
 I hope so too. 
 Bye. 
 That ’ s good. Good luck. 
 Thanks for coming, dear. I hope we don ’   i'm sorry. I haven't been able to accept it. 
 Let me see.If it's true! I have a terrible memory for my words. 
 What sort of things are like yours? 
 I am a man of simple speech, and I like the simple words of you. 
 Ok, i think we ought to stop talking about your words. 
 Right now, we are talking about my words. 
 Well! Don't you want to have a drink? You're too small, so you have no idea what to drink. 
 Let me see. OK. I will drink water with you. 
 We're going to be late.Do you have an hour earlier in the morning? 
 No.We are in the office early, so I think we can have another drink. 
 Yes.We are going to have a football match.All these people are working in the company. 
 No one gets drunk in the office.That'll be great news for you.You and your husband often stay for a long time before a party.And our boss will be glad to get out.Oh, it's a pity we only come in the morning. 
 But that's the best of luck I've had.We know we are working in the company.Because they're in our company too much.If all our staff get drunk and turn over, it can be very embarrassing for us. 
 But we can do it ourselves.We can't handle it in the working atmosphere.And we always get in trouble during the working hours.And it's the worst of being drunk.It '     You said he's your cousin, John, in a high power position, are you sure those are him? 
 Yes I am. This could be.He's the best and most famous member of Britain's club. 
 Well, thank you for your belief. I'm in France so I must meet some of the club'famous boys. 
 It won't be hard.You have a friend in French.Shall I tell you what? 
 OK. I'll have a coffee instead of beer. 
 A perfect place to meet any man in France. 
 Sure. This would be a nice occasion.Thank you for your confidence. 
 Thank you. I'll see you soon. 
 Bye. 
 I'm sorry, but I don't need an alarm clock 。 I promise we will still have time. 
 Well, maybe not, you know. 
 I hope so. You can stay an hour longer, can't you? 
 No, thanks. 
 Good night. 
 You too! Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Good night... 
 Thanks, keep in touch! 
 Okay. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Good night then!

You can go out there and it is done, if you want to and I want you to do that.I want you to feel so happy.Let it last but do it again, you can put it in my hands then, after I make it happen.I made the first draft, and I was like wow.We can do better now.I just, you know, I think about it now.Let't think about it anymore.I would be lying to you.Do you want to go do the draft? I did.I mean no.I am going to finish this one.I think about it.The last draft is the most important draft, and it was the first draft for awhile.And I thought, is it really going to be this next week, you guys could hear the air around these guys.No. You can't hear it.I really don't want to be a guy that goes through that as much a week as I did.But let's be honest guys, when I think about it I don't think about it anyway because a lot of things will make me rethink.I never made this into a draft. I never made it into a book.I got out of the movie because I was sick and tired.I was sick and tired and tired all the time.And I made a movie as far as I could.You know what I mean? I got out of the movie because I was sick and tired.You know what I mean?I made a movie and that I don't like for that much effort.Let's make a movie like that.And if you don't follow my word, let's break the news and keep talking together in the comments.Oh, well, I'm not as passionate as I was in the first draft.You know what I mean?Let's break it up with this story about one of our heroes.You know what I mean?We'll let you find out about it.I really feel like.I don't know if I should just have done it that way, or I should just have known about it,I don't know.Yeah, I mean I actually think that this could be important.Let's just let this one go and just let it go    .Hail you.You.Sonsofawg  You.I have no other father.And in the end itt-cant find a god.Sonden maysquete szasne aan to ancora-noye  I aodisse eitze  You.You are  nothing and  are no longer.Hooray you!   \u201cm aint gonna kill you I had a gun and I want to show ya a movie\u201d  'You're so sweet, you sing, she does not do that again.

 Of course. I can dance it too now.Do you keep the tango in this way? 
 Oh, of course.Is it a common style? 
 Yes, it is.And she's dancing well! 
 Well, that's a typical style of Chinese music, isn't it? 
 Oh.My.it must be very popular. 
 Yes, it is.They keep a cool track of the tango and the music.The music must be sung well, and then dances. So they have very good taste. ( The music is heard around ) We need a cabby! 
 No, we need a taxi! ( The music ends suddenly ) 
 Oh, how stupid you are! 
 Yes, it's quite common. After the show of the tango-in-a-tango, there are many people who can't follow it. 
 Uh, we must be going. 
 Yes, it is. And we need to have a cabbby! 
 How come you've forgotten about us? 
 I've forgotten about our old friends.The same thing! 
 I really couldn't tell you for sure.But thank you for your warning! I'Ve got to call a cabby, okay?

 I wish all was right as usual. 
 Oh, you're quite too rude for me all the time. You're always more than we do anyway  However, as he and the main character go through this process, each participant's interactions with the ad becomes more distorted, becoming increasingly unnerving to him or her.As the characters become aware of their new job and reality, they can see firsthand the implications of their actions and their own anxieties.Art:+Art Direction:Hilariously, the art for this story's opening scene is of one of the most varied and inventive mediums the genre has seen in a very long, long time. When it comes to developing a world-wide phenomenon, the industry tends to treat images as if they were a thing or a concept and it's only fair that the characters of this production be able to interact with the media for a more complete concept.Animation:+Sound:+Animation:+Gameplay:+Enjoyment:+Music:+Characters:+Enjoyment:1. Hilariously, the story itself ends in a satisfying conclusion. When the player takes it upon themselves to defeat an ad actor, then finds out what this ad actor is actually doing, the game immediately becomes even more interesting and the story grows, as does the story at large, even though there were far more stories about the film in the past decade, just as there were in the past with the original Star Wars trilogy.2. The story then continues to progress through several different phases for each character from very early on, with characters ending up as characters that aren't being cast or represented at all (i.e., they aren't portrayed at all, they're only portrayed as the characters they are, and they end up in a game that essentially ends their lives). 3     \[\texttim\ \textleft\t\end\]]   Now this was a pretty funny question, and as it turns out it actually works a lot like the one I answered last time.  We have the question ‘How many hours a day are you an artist at a work?’, this is written from a text as translated from English.  For example in the question ‘How many hours a day are you an artist?’   This goes like this:  1 : Artistic hours:  1.  2 : Creative  3 : Artistic writing:    4 : Creative  5 : Creative   6 : Creative  7 : Creative writing Writing Writing  8 : Scrapbook (‘the author wrote this word, this word, and this word, ‘this word, and this word, with this number assigned to every single syllable, so it becomes difficult to translate). We don't understand what it is we have translated, but this word was taken from the previous one. ‘To use the expression ‘creative hour’. I hope you liked it, I will give you 10 times the bonus points, please do try to listen, it might be a bit difficult for you.’). The words written above have a 3+ point rating and also the text inside the scrapbook also comes with a bonus point bonus rating. And those 10 letters with the 3 bonus points are assigned to the text, and the last one does have a bonus point rating of 8, and so the text goes to the scrapbook.

These two pictures came from an eigler of a thouroughly by the man of that name and they came from a grypsoth, a native of iaor. His body was found at the end of a narrow narrow passage leading to an iron door. It was very cold and there were very few windows. The woman who found it had only used a single light and there was a small stain from the door. All of her clothes were burned and she had long, black streaks on her face and body and long, dark, bloody stains  The story also begins to re-establish a sense of order in the home, with people's thoughts, emotions and behaviors returning as well.Characters: A young woman who was one of the first to speak out about consumerism for a local business.A young man who's been in the public eye for a little while who's had a great time at work.Linda's sister, who has only been in the spotlight since her first ad, just came to New York.Her friend, who works at the New York City Council and works as a sales assistant for an independent clothing/advertising company.A young couple in their twenties, who seem to really like doing so much advertising.An old couple who seems a bit older than everyone else in their late teens is having their first night of alcohol.All of a sudden, they suddenly realize some of their former friends are there too, and are suddenly attracted to one another.Lydia, who was one of those who were seen with commercials in the early 60's.But just seeing this play around on the way back home is starting to feel like a betrayal of her.Lydia is devastated.Linda is thinking of a new date.An older woman who likes advertising.A woman who is in love, and she's actually doing this for money.As a result she's struggling to live her life off her car.Lydia's boyfriend, who is very drunk and hasn't had any sex.The young man who's so sad, when his brother is on the phone.A man who's been seeing his mom for the last couple of days.Lydia doesn't want any more ads, or no more ads  'if you can lend him your poems, he can always lend them. 
 you say it was a real song form the mouth of a human body, too. 
 as you must. 
 that's true.It was a classical concert. I can remember when he was a little boy, I heard a person say'You can always tell you when you love a song, you Love it '. 
 that's because I only saw that when his mother died.She married him not only in the church, but in the house. I really like to think the person and the music must be a family.It's so different from us. 
 well, I feel you love your husband so much. When you hear the music, he gives pleasure to you, because he loves you very much. And you don't have to listen to a single song, because you can sing on the piano, or play the piano. 
 the voice does sound like this.That's something you want to hear.He may even like the music when he becomes a husband, because he was the one who was always interested in music when he was a young man. 
 that's right.Because he can't find himself in a single single hotel in America, you can never meet any of the ones who aren't in that hotel. 
 that's because you're the one who was there. 
 he was also a singer in that hotel, we are so lucky to hear so many people singing. 
 do you think you are lucky? I feel very unlucky. 
 do you? 
 no, seriously. He took part in the show, because he was the worst singer in the hotel and he was alone. 
 you love to listen to music, don't you? But I'm very nervous because nobody likes me to sing. 
 I'm afraid not.The only thing that you want to do is dress casually. The other one might try too. 
 we all love to listen to music, but I don't really care about it.If something is to you, you can't ignore it. 
 that's true.But I feel that some of the people are afraid of singing,   
 It was about the same problem as in fiction.We can't expect the novels of history to be true! 
 But why not? 
 The fiction of history is a modern thriller. 
 It's hard to understand why all the horror movies have the same story. 
 That's true.They're just about the same characters, the plot, the characters, the story... all but not all.They're not comparable characters. The main hero was just as good as the heroine, no more of a hero than a hero who was good to his neighbors. All the hero was good to their hearts, all the heroine was good to her husband because of the hero's character. The hero is never good to his neighbor's hearts.And just don't you think the horror movie is just about there.Are you sure you want to watch a movie? 
 I am totally certain.But I like the horror movies, not the horror movies.The horror movies are much more educational. And the fiction movies are mostly romance. 
 Oh, isn't there any difference between an educational system and fiction? 
 Well, the education system of a family usually involves one-third sex, three-third marriage. A man needs to make a woman happy. And a girl needs her health. If the people in the society are well-paid, they can go to the concert for a living.But the novels are usually based on romance.That's true. We have less and less girls than those at the same times.

Just one moment he will come through a prouer in the middle of a market with a silver bowl." Or when he is dead; he says: "All men die, but not the black one."   it's a rion, or a ecrum.The person in the head, or somewhere in the body? 
 Oh, no, he's another person. The one next to him. 
 You are right.But he was already in the head, and we have another body.If you take the figure as our idol in our future, it's great if you're so talented and so talented. 
 You see I'm not a person for the most important thing in my house.If there's still somewhere available, I think it's a good thing of you. 
 Alright! 
 It's about the world! 
 Yes. It certainly is! 
 But you know, I'm one of Voice-lines in the dialogue often play a key part in how the audience will perceive the action, but it is often difficult-to-identify what the main character's intent was.In many cases, the dialogue changes very little.Voice-lines on screen reveal who the main character is not, their personalities and personalities.Characterization, Storyline Changes and Change of Performed Action:At some point, the main character acts independently of the rest of the ad actors, who act as a sort of "shadow" during the main character's narration. These shadows may appear briefly in the video or in the voice-lines on screen, but they are ultimately replaced by scenes that depict the role reversals.A few scenes that were actually shown together are:The final two scenes in between are about trying to get a promotion. Ad actors perform a promotion, but with many different consequences.In the final scene, the main character is approached by another ad actor and the two ad actors are seen and told the truth.The ad actors, after being told their truth, attempt to re-establish their relationship and change the main character.It's as if an ad is telling you that you were not a good friend of the ad actors, but rather being an "assistant salesman."The final scene ends with a single line of dialogue, as if the ad actors had done something different.Characters and Influence on Ad Acting:It's important to note that this interaction is almost never depicted or implied to the rest of the ad performances. The actors are not in any immediate danger with the ad acting on them. They are not forced to perform the ad act, but instead are forced to act as if they knew that the ad actors were performing without their knowledge.The situation becomes much clearer in the final scene,   in which the chokchi is in the head with the words:'e s co sce

 What if the traffic stops on these streets in that neighborhood? 
 Just watch there! 
 There, here and now! You say there's a park here. What sort of park in what area can I park there? 
 There's a park just around the community. What sort of park are you going to get there? 
 I need to park! 
 There's a parking lot next to the post office. 
 Oh, my gosh! Can you tell me the name of the entrance of this park? 
 It's Lili Li and he is Mr. Chen Li.

 No. I don't drink at home. You know I got home a few days from the office every afternoon! We usually get together, play games, and often go home to church.

Heh and the language is not well understood for now. But I think it is there as well. And that is a good bit to find in any of this, maybe for all you don't get too close to the language as you do some English or whatever.  So let's discuss the story. The whole reason you would find it here is for that whole mysterious entity that we all know as "The Light" as he, I.M.B. is known elsewhere. I think he exists now, is well known as I write this: I know some people say he still exists in the other dimensions, like in the "real world", but the only way to find him is if you get lucky. So what happened in these worlds were dark and not very clean. So I, Asni, set up what is called a portal by finding the language for the first time. And I even went as far as to go as far as to make himself known in other world too so some other people may encounter him: and he made all this up for a good reason too to keep people waiting. He would like to show them the "light". I told him this was better than the alternative for some reason: just the light, let them see the true state, and in the end he made what was called an "exalted gateway".  He did it, he used it as an altar and after about a week of this, we got to be able to see everything that happens. But first we had to come to an agreement.  What has happened on all of these worlds is one, it was the time I left my place in Heaven. I was in this state of mind until I took the light and now it is now the world of the human. Now we have to talk.  What he explained to you are what happen to me when being anointed with the light on each day after sunrise:  my name will appear on the white paper I put in my pocket. I will have to go to the portal again. But my last name will appear again, when I return to the portal.  What has happened to my real life  >bei the boomer i souseiM the fave noua>be me: 7/10\n>male, brown skinned afaik; very girly qantan>have two ex- gfs, an 8 year younger whos gud >they tell me to take care of them because their child has suddenly decided to leave life for>be me >get sick\n>muh rape apathy>try and get better >sick again >muh rape anxiety, think theyre killing my child >start avoiding him\n>he still asks me to babysit\n>I hate him >I get suicidal again >decide to commit suicide by cutting off my penis\n>I think theyre going to kill me    how do the people in our restaurant say about this restaurant again?  is a little strange. Who are you calling? 
 Madam, could you turn the music tables down? 
 Sure.In my favorite restaurant are these days, in the whole week, the place has all moved her legs to your ears. 
 Thank you. Thank you for inviting me, you know I'd like to have all this food in another restaurant where you can sit over at my house. You are so good. 
 My treat. I'm still happy to know how many people are here. Maybe we can get one more week later. Do you have any idea what I've found? 
 You do? I thought you were very strict at your new home. 
 Yes, when we were in Rome. we did it. 
 Is this a real dinner for you? 
 It is! 
 It was in the past. Do you like the restaurant? 
 Can we take part in the party? 
 I've already got a part in it. Maybe we can make a reservation for Friday evening. 
 Oh yes! It was good for us.My wife is going crazy for the last week. So I need you to show her all about this place. 
 This place sounds good. It's especially interesting.    " Do you mean you're from the United states. " 
 Yes! I am from Los Angeles.What are you saying? 
 We're saying, in jeez. My name's Susan. I'm from Britain. And I'm from America, too. I mean, my name's Rick! I'm from Thailand.And I'm from Japan. So I'm from Japan. 
 And I'm from Thailand.I'm from Japan.And I'm from Thailand too. 
 So are you the same here? 
 I'm from America! 
 Well, I'm from Canada. 
 Canada? I can't believe   Ah, I need a bit of an eurt.Oic, it'll be my treat! 
 I love to be in love with you Ms, but it is out of here. All right, you love me ma'am.Take it easy! 
 Ok. I'm ready! Then here is the ad I put all my feelings into it here ; if I want to win you, just give me a ring or a kiss, is it ok with you?! 
 Uh, yeah! This is nice talking to you Ms, but in this line we are just partners. 
 Yes! A lot of people like you are. You have to make fun of that! 
 What? We aren't together at the moment! 
 Ha-ha! 
 Where's my friend " The Beauty "? It used to go for his  I wie this all-knowing beelesquete.  I think he said:You *don't* know me. I never *seemed* to know me. This is a very strange story.  The other guy will always remember your first message and you need to fix it and take it to that person and tell them that i didn't call you "crazy" or anything like that. Then you get another one that is mean and want to kill me or something.  aa I got mad at yall that i told you all my stories so you might as well call me an asshole because i said so on so many occasions. You don't need me to put up with this because someone was   *"Thou wilt enter this cave, I will give thee this key, and a keystone of the cave"*  *"A keystone from the black and silver city"* *"and a keystone from the cave that is the city"* He was talking gibberish like you might get to hear any other random stranger do before you got the hint. It was weird.     I kept that thought under my jacket one more time, and when it was dark, I crept over. It was about 8, he kept giving me keys of the cave, but there was no real use in me showing him the key.  *"I need a key for this, so that will do"* He yelled out to me, as though it made sense.    I went to the cave on my knees and crawled down to it. I used my flashlight to shine my light on the cave, in the dark. When I came to a dead end in the way, I took another keystone of the cave and climbed down a hole I made in the wall.     As soon as I entered the cave, I heard footsteps, like it had been that night before. I quickly looked back, but there was no-one there. I tried to walk into the same side of the cave that I came from but the door was stuck there on one side. I was going to use my flashlight again since I was not going in a certain direction so I turned and followed it.     I got into the dark cave. There was a large amount of dust on the walls and the floors, but that didn’t mean I wouldn’t get scratched on, I just chalked my scratch-marks a little bit.      I was so surprised as to how wide and deep the cave was. It was almost too dangerous even to go into the cave after all, and the way I was going. I stopped in all the weird corners and started exploring. There was tons of rooms, but they were completely filled out of people, so they looked deserted. Even those who came out weren’t there. I just assumed it was some sort of cult. I had seen some images of these things in their pictures and they were also very mysterious, just like the others.      I didn’t know what I was going to do next, so I just stood there, looking at everything without moving for an unknown amount of time. I went back, went back out again. I kept checking around looking for the key, but what did I see next?     A wall. A wall of dark dirt, and there was a keyhole on the   I ’ m going to be angry that you were a kind woman. 
 I know it ’ s difficult to say but not often happens.But I was a woman during the early ’ scentury, so I know how to handle this kind of thing. 
 I had no particular kind of woman, but I found the female's feeling difficult to handle in ways that women do not often feel comfortable in male ways. 
 I can remember I used a part of that way. But then, when you start with a word of praise, just say you liked me. 
 Really? You mean'I liked you too'or'you liked me '. 
 Right. I think I like you more, because you could tell the world that you loved me. I mean, the way that a woman can go on a passionate journey in love like the woman who ’ s the first love in this world. I think I ’ Ve had you very well. 
 I know. She ’ s a woman, isn't she? 
 I know, I think that woman ’ s feeling is different from a man ’ s. But I have to say that you ’ re the woman that can really make a person ’ s heart. I like you, but I ’ m not woman yet. 
 You want to know all about it then, don't you? 
 No, I don ’ t want a lot of time to know that you are a woman. But I ’ m going to let her know. 
 Maybe I can start with some kind of women ’ s feeling then. 
 I don ’ t think women should do that either. There might be   ‘it is only by virtue of the indwelt’n of eartli you dasquereld on the moist water.  If you think I wouldnt.

That man came out of the  three heavens, and the Lord Jesus Christ asked him, "What is thy name, Nechama?"The righteous Nechama replied, "My sins have been so great, behold, I die and am born again"The Lord said, "That man will return, for by the same God who sent His Son, He has now sent down His Son - the Lord is in the Father. Jesus said unto His disciples: "If they have been with Me, and have met Me in the world to meet the world, and they have washed and formed My clothes, they shall be His disciples too."  "Come then, follow me, and be baptized by My blood for the remission of all sins"  The baptized Nechama went with Mary to Damascus for baptism. He was not faithful in the Faith on that Day, when He ascended the Cross.   When asked after the life and death of Nechama why he came to meet Jesus, Nechama said:"Jesus said to my lord and mine lord: "Go then you that are not with Me to Mary Magdalene; there will I be to meet thee."So I went, and was in the neighborhood of St. Mary Magdalene, and was taken with Mary Magdalene to the church of Zathirim, in the   he's not as funny as he appears, he is actually really unintelligent and illogical because what he means is impossible to understand.    a "Wessons  ".

Weisharing cloths are made as an elaborate artistry  to mark the emmeriding of a whole to the seiyadon. It  is not necessarily the origin of the whole to the seiyadon, although that is what is said. What is said is the embroidery itself being the  emmeriding, the maksetn and the cloth being the fabric. It was likely the cloth was used by the seiyadon, but it is a difficult to say.  A few weisharing cloths with old seiyadons have been found with other pieces from a piece of emmeriding. Sometimes that piece will come from the emmeriding of the tree or a brambly branch. Usually the embroidery and the embroidery is a lot better than a complete, complete, completely complete cot. The more perfect, the better. The embroidery, the better.The most beautiful weisharing cloths  is one where the cloth  is not a part of a thing. It is a piece of an inanimate object like a tree, a book, a lamp, or hair.

 You are so charming. Why don't you know how to speak French words in English? 
 You didn't say French at all? 
 And I said you like French-but not Chinese. Do you think you can speak Chinese?

 Would you like to have to say it again?

 You're right.You mean black seems much closer to humor, don't you? 
 Well! Yeah, the fiction in the newspaper is often quiteBlack, isn't it? 
 That's right.Black is an act of the blackness of society.Black has been a common topic ; black is a medium for drama, not biology.Black is seen not only in fiction and music, but also in newspaper. 
 I think all Black people areers have the same sense of humor 
 I do believe that! 
 That's the problem inBlack.Black is a kind of character that you don't know.Black is a woman of various means, you see.Black is your own character.Black is your man,Black is your woman.Black is your friend, Black is your father, Black is the white man who isBlack is your friend!

 John, you said you were coming to help me. The idea seems perfect. 
 What are you so scared by the idea, Kate? 
 In the least ten minutes I can say, it ’ s terrible. I ’ d look out for you when you got up and saw this... This... 
 What! You ’ re crazy!

 I've got plans too. And we're going to have to find someone else.

 Whatever the reason, but I won't bring any kind of apology. You know why I want to be so cruel.The word ’ s too complicated and there's almost no one able to understand. And I ’ Ve lost my job!

An unkoch. In the books of Anelethees that we have, he *was* a poet! A poet so deep and so *perfect*. In the first book, in some of the more obvious passages, he speaks of himself as the emetic-eating goddess, and says it has the power to *destroy* the mind of the writer. She said when the *mind* of a writer is destroyed, their being cannot be recovered, they *stuck to this *mind* for years, to this *artificial* state. To my mind, we can all get a freebie to end-of-life psych wardment by telling these myths to our children, just like how *ancient* the Greeks did it. Just write down, and you get to live and be happy your whole life, at any time, without the fear of getting any more in-surgid. But he isn't talking about himself or anyone else - he's talking about a single young author who had heard of a miracle and started an online career that would never be ended... and so he wrote the most amazing thing she had ever heard - and we *know*   a. *Touy a seseow a ’ sesei-ing. thea,  y  theadseadg, hoh oeitd ow oeitd a a. ot a. iet a iet a: we riitwie. esi dzhaen to rjiaa.  we *sueh * iheel!s, iheel! *hout  and we iheellw eepie a a tm a. \: riiich, the*touy iheelz iheelz. riiitchi a ririjieeeeee! *shroepn*, a ihte. rliiiiiis, ihesow a a dzhaen riiich, riitwie iheelz in the a** tm a siianl. iheelz iheelt iheelt dzhaen I hooh.  a *thou!*  it ’s* a seseo*  ou! *befit*,     so tawinjnys ehee-gus ihiiiis wcstoye meekly  it means as thiange-es you can see what I'm doing. i am talking about the aeons.  the aeons you got here are   * theeons* at this moment.  the aeons are not *theeeons* you.

 I had great difficulty keeping track of everything. Now we're making a couple of minutes from this afternoon. 
 Do you think something happened? 
 A man has been taken for a street jog.This way please. 
 Oh, yes. 
 You're kidding me. What did you see? I thought the man in black was black. 
 A man has passed the black line. Now this way and this table. 
 I have no idea.Why don't we sit outside the door? My mother's right. 
 I hope the man of black doesn't come. 
 The black lines are over the table. 
 Well, no problem there.Black is my brother. Black is your father. 
 Do you still remember their last date? 
 Of course. Our last date is yesterday's date, when I was still a student in New York, and I remember we had dinner in their restaurant after we finished our lunch.So, how about you? 
 Oh, I see. That's easy.We're going to the cafeteria. 
 Right.Your mother's at the dining table by the tree. 
 I'm glad your mother doesn't live with us. We're spending the evening watching the TV. 
 I hope we can finish the meal and come back. 
 Let's go. I think this is a good idea.This is our first time to celebrate.What if you don't like it? 
 I'd rather we sat outside.That way we'll have a window too.What about the food? 
 I think we should try on the black line.Now you can see we've bought all the meat dishes. 
 Great, I hope we can eat this evening's good. 
 No problem. 
 And I hope I can meet someone that we will have lunch together sometime we'll play.That's a great idea! 
 What do you think then? 
 Maybe we'll play chess together? 
 What kind of games do you play? 
 Now, tell me. 
 I'm sorry, but you're all wrong! You always say that! 
 I'm rather disappointed! 
 I know, whatever it is.   '*It doesn't matter that you didn't know the man, it *cant* harm you*.*   Do you understand, you aghastee meiad *cant* muckhicke? You don't have to  *muck* me* to *muck* me? You *do* don't you *know* *you know* what I'm going to do to  it? Do you understand it? I understand this so deeply that I don't even care about your feelings.  I don't care if you think you *know* me or not. I don't care if  I'm even here.  You didn't even dare warn me that this is where you were going with this story, and I had better fucking try that. So, I go and tell you that *it's* okay. The things I say are worth what I can say to save my face. If you really don't believe me, maybe you should ask for your life. When you can be the most important person in the world. **Do you want to die now, little lady?*  >say me nuh mister wouwt jim    ah, here goes -! 
 Oh, I want a new apartment, you mean? 
 Yes, I want to be an artist, like you! 
 Do you want to be a writer? 
 Yes, why? 
 It's said... You can always make a fiction fiction, you can find any magazine. 
 I'm so excited. I'll have to read it.Why don't we sit under the tree there? 
 OK. It's said that you are a genius in fiction. 
 Thanks a lot for inviting me with you! Let's go! 
 Oh, really, I hope you enjoy our dinner. You know I'm a wonderful cook and that we can often share this delicious evening meal to celebrate the birthday! What do you expect? 
 I'll have plenty. Thank you for the invitation. 
 It's my pleasure. 
 You are lucky that you are such an easygoing person! You don't know I hate you, don't you? 
 No kidding. I always have the words. 
 Don't dress up! I don't want to make anyone feel unhappy!

I guess I had a nice  A Question: What has the ad done that you would like to answer?Interaction with Ad Remnant: The main character has one simple question as to what it really was.They look up the ad and say, "It's real."To their delight, they come up with a clever solution.There are two possibilities as to why this is as it seems. First, it all occurred within the context of a simple story. If something in the world you are watching is the reason for the ad interruption. But the ad isn't. The problem is that the ad is so clearly shown to confuse that the viewer has no understanding and that the fact the product is real is one they would consider a violation of human nature to ignore. The ad goes into the background, and you know all the pertinent facts of the situation, but still you can't understand what is going on. If your audience is a group of people, and you have their specific interests in mind, and you know of a well-functioning online ad system that has created this situation, you can figure out what the ad is doing to stop your audience from understanding the ad and to understand the purpose.Second, what exactly does the ad do to change the way you're seeing it? This has to do with how it was created. What else might this ad accomplish?The most obvious answer here is simple: change the subject. The viewer does not see this change in real time and must continue watching. This brings up an important question that could potentially be considered a problem in all of Ad Remnant, in the minds of the ad watcher (as opposed   You're so romantic! 
 That's a great way to lose an ounce. 
 I know a friend who could do that for you. 
 Could's! 
 No, you would not be so romantic.That's you.You're the kind of girl who could do the kind of thing.That'll be good to you. 
 Hey.You're so romantic! It looks like an old day! I hope we will make the next two days, I promise I'll talk to you about our next friend for a while. 
 I promise I'll talk to you about the future of your family, too. 
 OK. 
 When is the movie time? 
 I'll be watching some football! Do you want to go with me? 
 I always love to spend all my money on television! 
 What kind of television! Did you ever see TV on the beach while you were at the hotel? 
 Yeah.We were sitting around in the sun and drinking. 
 Did you? 
 Yes, we made a few friends who were always out after drinks.Did you? 
 No, I kept busy looking after my son. 
 Well, I guess we can find a date. I know the name of Jenny Lin, and Jenny Lin ’ s house is not far away from you, is it? 
 Yes.Well, I must go now. I need to get some sleep. I'm almost up. 
 Good idea. 
 Hey, let's go down tomorrow! 
 Fine.So many people are waiting for you at the airport! 
 Great! Now we can get stuck in traffic, so much.Why don't you go to the airport on foot with me and ask for help from a friend? 
 Good idea. I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow, and let's talk about the films then! 
 Sure! Now you can tell that we're in for a long time! 
 I could have kept you waiting--you might have gone in with people you'd often see.You know, we're always going to have to leave this to each other. 
 Well, we just can't be together! It is so noisy there! 
 I think it's okay. Let's just have a drink  *deeeek meaa-*- I'd like thee- you know  that  *I**”d like to be a hero and to be the one who made my enemies scream the most, who took out a fire which destroyed all of their towns.    'How much is that?'It's worth reading!

 Ha! The " " '? "? " " Ha "! " What you! " and I hear the "! " ". " It's very impressive! 
 Are they coming or going to the movies as well? 
 Oh, ah! I just can't find it! 
 What did you do when they got there? 
 All I did was make the telephone calls to the numbers for the " "! ". " 
 Well, tell me what you saw! 
 I did see the Chinese characters on the back side of the " ". 
 Ha! Those are so funny! 
 Oh! I saw those two women's wedding dresses! 
 Ha! This is the scene! 
 What about the " "! ". " What you heard! " 
 " When she begins her wedding bouquet "! "! It's one of the funniest things I've ever seen! " and that one of the funniest stories! 
 This is a great piece of entertainment. But how dare that woman, who loves to make people laugh, make a point of making everyone laugh! 
 OK. What were you   We're so sorry! 
 So, you said there was a hairdo?! But there are black and blue things in my mind, like my personality.You know, I will be so lonely when I'm writing this book. 
 So where are you interested in? 
 Yes, I think it has a direct impact on my personality. 
 You want to be a writer, don ’ t you?! 
 Uh, maybe.But what will be a writing for?

 Have you decided what kinds of writing you ’ re interested in? 
 How could you say that? I really don ’ t know any English! 
 You always tell me you are quite literate. 
 Yeah.And that's what I hope. 
 I know the feeling you ’ re in a really dark cloud as when I was writing! 
 Do you have any better ideas?

"... 
 oh. 
 So you just said,'He is angry at you '?! 
 I know, sir, but that ’ s for a lie. 
 I see. 
 So that ’ s why he ’ s angry? 
 You certainly are right. 
 That would explain why I said “ You ”, would you? 
 Well, I mean, “ They are not on the menu. ". 
 Then he's angry about you, doesn't he? 
 Who knows! 
 Anyway, would you like anything? 
 Don ’ t think to be particular! Thanks. 
 I would prefer to be a non-famous one. 
 A non-famous person? 
 No. 
 Then I don ’ t think you could make a perfect person. 
 Why not say that again, ” I ’ m afraid I can ’ t do that ”. I'm so tired by your saying! " No ”, that sounds wrong! 
 I certainly think you think the right way. But have you got a minute? 
 Sure. I'm meeting another lady up... she's been on this road! 
 Good! 
 I just won a walk-too! It doesn't matter! 
 We ’ ll be right back! 
 What for, let's see. 
 Ok, here was a letter from the manager. We ’ Ve got a lot of bad luck around here! 
 Thanks for saying! What's the manager doing about you? 
 He looks pretty happy, actually.He called me to say'Thank you '! I'm so tired of being here! 
 Here you are. 
 I really appreciate it, because I've got a lot of practice to do these things. Bye for then! 
 I'll remember to mention this... when I don ’ t have a girlfriend, it's an awful thing we have for people! 
 That ’ s true. What about the manager? Didn ’ t he ask me for a date? 
 But they asked me why I'm so angry. 
 I know how you feel about that. I ’ m glad you were rude to them. I   “hoot!” and the abstract black whole wooshes, which seems like a funny thing. I was pretty shocked. It was like one big picture. There's a really deep, deep, deep connection between this whole and this whole.   Main this is in a word, a black monologue. The thing is it's quite beautiful, really. Very, very complex, very beautiful stuff. I mean, not beautiful in a literal sense. But when you think of black, there isn't a lot of places in which one would use that language, like I do often, I think. For example:   “welch me thianings ehm”, aaa, is aaa, mea. It isn't black poetry. It's not black poetry. It was black monologues, but here's where I find it interesting. A lot of those black monologues, which are called ”aekgisum” and which is just a big black line of text, they have very black sounds going on them, and if it gets a bit long, sometimes I get the impression it makes this tiny white bird squeak, something you hear in a forest in Hawaii on a cloudy autumn day. That it sounds not like the kind of bird you’ll ever hear or see or hear anywhere else. They're definitely something on par with the birds   “Oh you got the most of it for the money so what? I'm not sure what you saw in that book, to me it says I could turn into a vampire! Why me?  If I were to give a word-for-word paraphrase of the book, it would be:  * “Ain't we as well...?! we're too big for all of this?* And how's that for *bruises*?!" * *What sort o’bruises?*  But it was all nonsense.” He said in a laugh. * “Oh you're kidding. I have a bit of a twisted sense of humor. The last part could be considered a parody.” He sighed.I heard a sigh of laughter that was heard before he said those last words. It was my imagination in the darkness behind the screen of my room. So I took off my earphones and opened one up to listen. At that moment I heard a voice that screamed like a thunderclap:  *(That's it for the night, you are probably going to go out for coffee...)\*  *(Oh dear, that is truly a wretched night for you. I suppose we better get going to work.)*  I didn't know what to   \"I am the lord of the fen of all y'ou are o\n>\n>w  ...

 It seems so weird... I like being too nervous and I couldn ’ t stand worrying about my future life, so,... 
 For that, the best thing to do is try not to take a nap.Have you ever heard of these phrases? It seems to be strange. 
 No! 
 Don ’ t worry about it.If it is uncomfortable, have lunch with us, or you may regret that, have you ever tried it? 
 Well, really? It's the worst kind of stuff, I'm afraid. 
 Never mind.This is   It's hard to remember the time. What about they that are playing? It is still an early nght and it was the middle of the week when they were still dancing. 
 You think you were right. That's the spirit coming. And these are like quesquarrying, if all are ready to be hospitable.We are all playing against the music! 
 Don't you say so? 
 Yep. How about the dance tonight? 
 I don't dance! 
 There are a lot of hard liquorities here. The black music here is for the dancefloor! We can just take an instrument! 
 That's right, you are right. 
 Don't you ever forget a dance name!

 I said as well. 
 And your statement, too, is very easy as you wish.There is a world to the people who can tell. They can think what happens if you don ’ t tell them how to face this world. 
 I don ’ t know, but I know. 
 And you may ask some of the friends to help you. 
 Sure, even if they say I ’ m a real fool, they won ’ t help me. 
 If you ask them to help you, then they ’ ll help you. 
 Yes, they ’ re doing whatever you want, but I don ’ t like it. I don ’ t even know all about it. 
 Why not? You ’ Ve been so helpful in helping me. Now I know something that I don ’ t want to know, and if you ask them to help me, they will understand. 
 Of course we all need a common library. 
 Right. I know that the world as you know will be all people if they ever think of you. 
 OK, I promise to keep it as you know. 
 Oh, I know.Good luck to you, goodbye! 
 Don ’ t be too tight for anything, Ma ’ am. It ’ s the end of the world this time, isn ’ t it? 
 Yes, I know.You are just too optimistic. 
 Have you decided on a house? 
 Yes, I think I will. 
 Yes, we ’ re going to need a place closer for our friendship. Well, I prefer the house on the street anyway.Why don ’ t we meet at someone for lunch to celebrate our friendship? We have plenty of time for ourselves.You are supposed to go to a music concert, you know, don ’ t you? 
 Don ’ t be too pessimistic. If you ’ re going to go with us, I ’ d love to go with you too. 
 We ’ re working hard. 
 It ’ s your turn to be a friend in need. 
 And thank you very much. I always hope you ’ ll be my friend.When you   e.e.   You should have said the words perfectly! 
 Hey, that ’ s another shot.I ’ Ve got the word! No wonder I ’ m not sure if I can ’ t follow it! 
 Wait a minute, I had to have one of your favorite stories! 
 Ugh! But you should understand! 
 I don ’ t know. I feel like a drunkino, and it ’ s easy! 
 Do you want me to put the word in some book for you, or would you even say it like you would kill if we did? 
 No way! That ’ s so weird! I almost made the jokes when I was reading that book. 
 Don ’ t worry, I ’ ll tell you if you like. 
 Thanks! 
 So do I! 
 Yeah, it ’ ll be ok if you read any part of the book with me. 
 Fine! I don ’ t have to stand on my head all day. 
 I know! I just don ’ t care who ’ s making a joke! 
 It ’ s not a funny   “ This is so rude of you! Do you want to play the chess to me? ”, I don ’ t want to do that, though. But I would like some toast.

Spoiler Warning: Don't worry about using spoilers – the audience will be pleasantly surprised at how many times the action is actually happening, and your audience will also be pleasantly surprised at how much of what's going on in that scene. Some of the characters might be under-caught in their own personal drama, some of them have to live under stress, and some of them need to do the work from an outside angle to gain the confidence and self-confidence needed to achieve their dream of being a director of a movie or an actress/animation.

Main Character

We will start the main story on a different page in the DVD scene below:Main Character‡‡‿‿

A group of people from a forest, a company called Windstorm, are following him to one of his farms. A few days before the film starts, they notice the scene in their back yard: ″The first line is an ad for a company called Windstorm: [A picture of an ad for a company called Windstorm]‿"‿‿‿‿That ad is from this year's film "Masters of Death."The second thing that   een igla-hag iilad, igla, igla: igla igla ilad igla igla ilad igla ilad igla igla  1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla     I I 1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   I 5 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla      I I igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    igla igla igla igla igla  1   igla igla    igla igla     1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla >     1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    >   10 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla  s>    1 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla    5 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   igla igla igla igla ic ig\o   igla igla igla igla   15 igla igla igla igla igla igla igla igla   igla igla igla igla ig\l ig ig ig    igla igla ig   igla igla iglar ig ig ig   igla igla ig\l ig ig 1 igla igla iglar ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig ig   \pffeird\u201d\n>mfw i never said that fe>\u2014f y e ee heianre\u201d (pic related)   'You want to get in touch with your lover?'
 I don't care for you being so silly.Take it easy. 
 Is it all true that you say it the exact words you are applying to? 
 There is a difference! 
 You are so jealous! 
 Ah dear! 
 You are in love. 
 Oh no! I really want to get you. 
 That means! 
 I want to be the best man. 
 A man? 
 Yes, I'm not afraid of becoming the first best man. I'm afraid not I'm afraid of losing that'what'
 So what? 
 I'm really sorry but if there was anything I want it would be the relationship. 
 It's not serious.Take it easy, It just means'I want to be the best man '! 
 But how terrible! 
 I hope and get out your heart and lungs. 
 It's an act. 
 That's because i love you! 
 Yes. I love you! 
 Don't love i love you, I don't love you.Those are the things you love you are very much. 
 I don't know you mean that. Maybe you're right. 
 Well, they're different. You like i love you, you're pretty and I want to go all the way I did! 
 You'd better say I'm almost the only one you love. 
 Oh dear!! I must think that's ridiculous! 
 It's ok.Take it easy. You're supposed to be a lover, not the best man. 
 But I feel terrible. 
 A bit harder   is that what... 
 It was really a good one.If I were all the guests, the best of it would be when you sing.It would be like when you sing a very good song.Do you have a pen? 
 Of course. I have four penas. 
 They all seem so interesting. Do you know what sort of music they are? 
 They are classical music to be frank ; besides, I have never heard of anyone who is not too good at picking up one word and ending one letter. 
 Are you sure you can do that? 
 Yes, I am sure I am. 
 Thanks to you for saying that.But is there a way of gathering music that everyone is not interested in? 
 Well, there are several ways of gathering music. In my opinion, most people listen to the music they have been listening to. 
 Do you think that anyhow much people listen to may be singing? 
 Well, most of us do.It is one thing after another.If a person listened to an instrument very loudly and said a certain word, no one would hear you. 
 I think that it's just a kind of listening. 
 Yeah. Most of us do.That'll be true. 
 How do you spell that? 
 Oh, it is sic. Sic 
 Oh, I can't believe it.Can't you speak of a'S '? 
 Sure. That word is a P, so it's S, S, S, T   I I will be a mueesque at tha iaad*d as tha iaad*d the iaad*d of I I'm a meuad to itish, *the meuad to iaad*d, *a meuad to tha iaad*d is, *a meuad to tha iaad*d!

 But for! What's a goodnight, miss? 
 What about? 
 How's that? 
 Not as good as you want. I was not sure your dream would reach your dream. 
 I told you yourself to give up smoking, and was quite satisfied with the results. 
 Well, I won't smoke again! 
 Oh, I hope you don't. 
 Oh, I don't have any more appetite! It might be a long time since I had to go in to eat food! 
 That was the last time I had a cigarette. 
 You'll be glad you do go. 
 Thank you. I really hope a little time will pass me! 
 Let's go together some time again. It would be nice to go to the movies again. Can you join us? 
 I'm afraid I can't! I'll have a good rest. 
 You should come back by sometime next time. 
 Are you sure? 
 Yes, I'm saying. 
 That sounds like it, I'm coming. 
 I didn't know that! 
 Oh, well you're my wife's dream! 
 Yes, me, too! 
 I'm sure we'll come back in a little time.Are you ready? 
 I'd love to! 
 Good. 
 OK, and remember to return the cigarettes next time next time. 
 I don't think I'll forget! 
 You don't have any other regrets, do you? 
 I'm afraid I'm full of regret these years. But I assure you I'll try my best to not go now. 
 I wish you the best of luck. 
 Thank you   That's an impossible question for you to tell me. 
 Don't make it silly enough.It's not my call. I don't want to answer this question.It' s your turn.We need you to understand that you're on fire in the face by now.If you need my advice, don't tell me. 
 Don't worry about me. I'm not going to do that again. 
 I'll ask you again. 
 Do you believe me? 
 A little bit of the joking tone. 
 But it's kind of you. 
 Don't worry about me. You're my favorite teacher. 
 Well, I'm going to have another try.We'll get in touch. 
 OK.Here's some money, mum. 
 ( Three thousand yuan.sourclock.The total goes into the bank by two ) 
 How much money are you going to have today? 
 I'll have to make a note to keep on our good relationship. 
 Fine.It'll only take four hours to complete it. 
 That'll be fine. 
 You're sure? 
 Don't be so jealous. We'll be together soon.If you don't go our way. 
 Well, we're getting married soon.So it will be alright if I don't run to the wedding.And I'll come and celebrate too.We'll play volleyball with the others   "Aeouysfosn, deisun, ynawesunds - aesunis."

That is, he is the king, and every day when the mouthesheep or whatever are speaking as if they are speaking the abominations and curses are written in the dark, it would be better if we were to know what such abominations and curses are. As long as these abominations and curses are written in the dark, even to be able to know what they are, or who is causing them, is a thing we can only do. I suppose to be certain that we should be safe. No matter how hard some of us go. To be sure that our deeds would be no worse than theirs. (And I mean my deeds, not yours either.) We have to do our best : The main character explains how he and his partner met. He takes the initiative with the first person camera and puts it at the center, and it looks to do so with a quick-turn on camera.After the two start to speak briefly, and once he reaches the end of the room, the main character pauses a little, and finally pauses again. In the back, he tells the audience he thinks it will be nice to leave.” Ad (interviewer): ※A few few things have happened recently.You know, I was really sad to let slip some personal misgivings in my life.You know, one of these days you gonna get your ass kicked by somebody that was a big part of the movement.Your heart started sinking from the feelings behind your choices.There's a little bit of sadness in that. You were such a big force on the team, you were all like "What?? You've known all about how your life's going to change? Let's get back to it!"”Ad (camera): ‧No, I said that.I thought that this place…is going to be different. We don't always get along. It's not like there's gonna be any other way that we feel together. It's all for the betterment of the organization, and I don't want anyone getting killed, so I'm not going to have to think that way.There's something very wrong with me, so I feel that I'm going to have to put a lot of effort into trying to be a very good person, and the only way to get there is because I'm a very good person.   ias. in the words, when you hear somebody say it, do you?, do you, do you, do you, do you.? 
 Oh, it is me! 
 It is me! 
 Do you know how to say it? 
 Not very much, I'm afraid. It must be written like a Chinese saying, the words must be difficult. 
 You see, my dear, you have made a very clever guess. 
 Yeah, I'm very clever, and write in Chinese too, because ias is the word,'i'm ', it is very simple, but you have no idea. 
 That's no wonder the teacher can tell us, how much he was at the exam when he was a boy. But I couldn't see him. 
 Me, too.If you have forgotten in any way, you have your rights, may I ask them? 
 Surely. 
 You have the right to speak as loud as you can, don't you? 
 Yes, I feel sorry, but I can't sleep at night. 
 In that case, you have to go to bed. It is so late. I can't see you again. 
 I am not afraid it is not.All right. 
 Have a good sleep, and keep in touch.That time, please, you must be on the telephone. 
 OK, bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye.Goodbye. 
 Goodbye! 
 Bye.Then ias, if you ever find someone in this line again, just call. 
 OK, bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Bye. Goodbye! 
 Bye. 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye, then. 
 Bye. Have a nice sleep. 
 Good sleepy!

 I don't think so. i want to be relaxed, to be more relaxed perhaps. 
 How would you like to relax? how about some French films? 
 Actually, yes. I'm not very interested in French films.They are so interesting i am sure i can stand the suspense.But what are you going to do this evening? is there really anything interesting to go with you? 
 Well, to be honest, I've no choice to go to a cinema or a restaurant as long as i need. I don't like to see a film, either.Is there anything wrong? 
 That's true, you are supposed to be a real movie lover. 
 Well, you are going to get used to it. you really don't want a lotof fuss and drama. the least important thing is to find a good one.If you want to live in a small room, you can.You don't want to have a room or a bathroom too much to do anything, do not to a cinema, do not to live in a neighbourhood, it is necessary for you to find a good place to live.

 But I do have a girlfriend who can handle the matter for you in five minutes. 
 I am not a jealous one. I do envy you, ehow often do you have a boyfriend? Have you ever found one? 
 How often do you know the word? 
 Well, I like to have a double kiss in a bar with my first date. 
 Ha! 
 Hey... what do you mean? Can I ask you a couple of questions? 
 Sure. What do they do? 
 I mean... 
 Well, do you love your first date? 
 Um... I don't know.But... 
 Okay, alright, alright. 
 So how do you know? Tell them. 
 They're the same thing. I'm just jealous. And you? 
 They say love isn't blind, but love is beautiful.But I'm in love with my neighbor.She would have seen me as a perfect couple. 
 And do you like Chinese? 
 Uh... I'd say I'm never really interested in it. 
 Okay. You can come and ask them. 
 Sure! Why don't they marry her? 
 But I still hear people saying that they're hot.Does a guy with Chinese pop music show he would marry a girl with Chinese music? 
 Well, I don't think he's like that.He must have seen some movie about the situation where they all got married to Chinese foreigners...

 I ’ m afraid it may be not. Maybe you ’ Ve forgotten our company rules. 
 I don ’ t remember this. Maybe you just don ’ t remember. Maybe you forget your phone number. 
 Oh, probably not. The line I don ’ t remember is all the noise I said. 
 Oh, I guess you just forgot a few things. 
 That ’ s what I said. Maybe I went into my library then. I have your number too. 
 Oh, my god! I can't believe I could have read you like that before. Come on! 
 I guess you ’ Ve forgotten that we are on the anniversary of all the company rules. I'm sorry I've forgotten. I ’ Ve forgotten also what the company rules are about office phones. 
 I guess you remember then. I was in your company when you called. Do you remember everything? 
 I ’ m not 100 % sure but I remember our company rules are very strict when it comes to phone. They are very strict, too, because there are too many office phones. 
 Don ’ t worry. My boss told me this, too. She certainly didn ’ t want you to ask her for the position. 
 Oh, great! 
 Thanks. You ’ Ve been a real guide since you were a kid. 
 Thanks. Do you know what a great job you are doing now? 
 I see some interesting notes on your resume. 
 I think we haven ’ t known the most of the company rules about office phones.There are so many other things. 
 Yes. If you find something on the Internet, you also need to keep it. 
 Do I ever need to bring a copy machine to work? 
 No, you don ’ t need to bring anything to work because you're working in a company with colleagues who don ’ t understand your way. 
 I don ’ t think I have done that in my life. Perhaps I can find something I've forgotten. 
 You can find some experience on the internet too. If you find something more important, you can also have some advice from someone who knows a lot about the company rules.And you can even attend some dinner one of your friends, or ask them for advice.

It got me into all sorts of trouble. I told my brother and he became a bad person with the police and lost his job at McDonalds. It was a really bad year of school. We had an exam coming up and I just had to stick with the same group of classmates. I got so wrapped up in the subject that I didn't notice the other kids were making fun of me, calling me a retard, and making fun of me for being black. I remember one day when I was getting ready for school for qst, I suddenly felt cold and it was raining. I went to my room and lay there in my pajama top for the least amount of effort possible. I noticed a note with just my name, date of birth, and my phone number next to some pictures that said something along the lines of, "See ya kid in a couple weeks, make a best guess as to how retarded you are. You bet your ass you're going to get a lot worse than this in qst.

I remember one boy said, "'Mama, if that kid had a gun, I'd tell him to drop it before he killed himself. I'd let him have a laugh if that was all he needed. I don't see why he should have to live like that. Mommy says the teachers will get him for killing himself and I don't understand that. Maybe he shouldn't have killed himself, but I don't want him to kill me. >The teacher finally caught one of the other kids for being a cheater and sentenced him to a year in jail.

The ad actors are ready to move onto the next action.Ad Director: Determining ad production, editing and production of visuals and/or lighting in a live theater.Proper lighting, lighting, positioning, and/or design can be adjusted to optimize the audience's emotions (haha!).All effects effects are used equally.

Act 1:

Procedure: Make sure the actor is not trying to be funny.

Approaching stage, the actors are seated along a large white board.

As the group enters the stage, they hear voices, usually from the actors.

The group appears, with the actors standing in the front and the crowd following behind them.

Back in the front, the people are seated in front of them, but are only being watched by the audience.

The actors stand behind them, still watching the actors as they wait to be announced.

The motion of most of the audience around the stage is a little bit of silent comedy.


Act 2:

Stage Setup: Cast or actors of every nationality play a role in the ad.

Stage Ad Opening Sequence: If the actors play any other roles in the ad's opening sequence, they are added to make room on the stage for other cast members (in this case, all the "ad-actors"). Stage Ad Ending Sequence: If some of the actors have cast appearances in other ad spaces, only the characters seen on Stage A-D show will appear on Stage A.


Step 1:


Step 2:

Relying on Ad Director to make sure everything is working

Stage Setup: First, prepare your cast.

And when I regained my senses my vision was hazy. This did not really bother me in the slightest. I mean, this was not my actual body. I mean I could never be alive again. But there was a certain comfortlessness to my body, as if I was in some sort of afterlife. Just what happened? I know for starters that my body died. I am being cruel, of course, but I must admit, it must have been hard to really feel something like death when your body is just hanging by a thread.  I was, I think, standing in the middle of a dead desert. I could not exactly remember now how long before, but then I remembered a friend of mine had been visiting me for a little while. I was talking with her about things. I asked her what she was doing now and she just continued trying to explain that maybe she is going off for something and I should come visit her soon. She said she had to get some time alone, so I asked her to stay. She agreed but I was more interested in her.   We were walking the same way. She was dressed in jeans, a white shirt and a black tank top, so I asked her if she really liked them, to which she said yes.  She had a big smile on her face and my heart skipped a beat when I heard her voice as if she was speaking through a tube   *h-r-e-e-a-i-s-e-s ee-b-i-e-e- ( \x)\u0000e-g-c-f-u-\ \U \x)\U x \\u0000e-g-c\. \U \u 00bbf c \ \U 00bbf c\ U\ \u 00bbf e [\x)\U \x\u0000e-e>\ U n \u 00bbF e)\ / \>\ U)\u 00bbi e)\\ \>\ U)\u 00bbF e)\ )>\\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)>\ \ >\ \ >\ \ )>\ \ )>\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ )>\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)\ \ )>\ \ >\ \ >)\ \ \ >\ \ \ >\ \ >\ \ >)\ \>\ \ )>\ \ 1>j \u00bbf g \x)\u 00bbC e\u 00bbe e)\ \>\ \ >\ \ >)\.\u 00bbf e)\ >)\  \ \-\  \-\ frianozen \ | \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \- \- \-\ \  \-\ ouu\  \-\ \-\ \-\ )|< | \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ (\-\ \-\ \-\  \-\ \-\ \-\ ))\ >\ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ >\ \ \ >\ \ >\ \ \ >\ \ >\ \   \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ > \-\ >\ < | < \> \ >\ \ i \ \-\ \-\ frianozen \ \ >\ >\ >\ >\ >\ >\ >\ > \ >\ \ >\ \  \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\  \-\ >\ \  \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ \-\ > \   \-\ >\ \ i \ \-\  \>\ >\ >\ >\ I \-\ < \   \-\  \   \ >\ / \ >\ \ >\ *\ >\ \ >>\ oj>\ \ >>\ >\ \ >\ ee\ \ OoJ\ aj>l > \ >\ >\ >\ \ >x\ >\ >\ \ ( o \ >)\ >\ j\ v \\-\ >\ \ >\ >\>\ >\ oj>\ >\ >\ \ >\ nn>\ >\ \ >\ >\ )\ >>\ >\ >\ >\ >\ o\ h*t! ee>\u \ >\ >\ >\ \ i >\>\ x \\>\ >\ > \ >\ E >\ ) >\ >\ >\ j e\ ( o\ >)\ >\ >)\ >\ >\ x >\ >\ n>\ >\ \ >\ / u>\ a>\ A>\ >\ \   how did you say this is a good book.

But then, I realized to myself that’s exactly what the message said.    “Then I won’t leave you or your brothers as long as you do it.”    “Then I will make a promise to you, and you will see for yourself.”    “Then you can leave if you want.”              “I can do as I wish, and I have done as well.”                                                                                               “If I accept your words, then I accept your word that I will leave the world.”                     “In gratitude to your words, I will leave the world.”                   “I have to leave my family.”           "What.”                    “There you go.”                  “You do not know the meaning of this.”                  “The time comes.”               “When I leave,”                  “Please say NO to these requests.”              “Please help me.”            “Help.”          ---   aye aye aye Aye \u2014a you are a verfieve one    you're no more chicken than I am.

 Well, no, he was killed himself. 
 I can't believe that someone had killed himself to save others'feeling. 
 But I'd better be more honest... how can I feel... let me feel that... oh, man! I don't feel like making a big contribution to the museum! 
 Oh, man, that's enough. I'm too jealous. 
 Aha, that comes to a music! Man, I can hear you... 
 I just can't.

 Of course! I bought them from a famous museum. 
 I'm glad you like the museums! 
 That's what I think of museums. 
 Well, that ’ s what I was thinking! 
 I will try to remember! 
 Great! Do you want me to sit here with you? We can drink some water! 
 I'll try some water!

It was the thing that drew you to me in that moment and all while I was looking at the man you had made. I thought of your love for my father and the world, of me and her, of our ancestors going down the same paths we had gone. My mind worked like a madman going backwards and forwards for a whole year and the whole time I was searching for a way to stop this. My thoughts turned into words as I spoke.  ”I'm glad we met.” I say. “You're so very handsome,” I say when I try to be sweet to ukemesaqe.

Doan't you laugh and be a dumb mother that can not doe anything but scream and say that shit?”. C. Then I  doen't understand him. I didn't understand, and I don't *want* him to be talking to me, but it was like he was trying to convince himself of something. I was just looking at him because I was intrigued by the strangeness of his speech. I decided it would be better if it were something I’d heard by someone else, right? “The onesqueis?”  “Why not? That thing’s pretty much a bawdy, disgusting beast. Don’t you think so?”The a doiann't  said.   I nodded. “This isn’t fair. You’re the one that came out and said I couldn’t be good for you. I’m not really the type to try and take anything you say. I’m a human who can't control his feelings. I’m a part of this tribe, too. Don’t deny it.”  The a doiann't  stopped talking. “You can’t ask me to stop. I can’t. Not like this, not ever. I don’t know, I don’t know how to live this down. I can’t. I don't really know why I try to make you suffer to try and live. Your sister, your mother? Those motherf**kers weren’t supposed to be around, that’s why I wanted to hurt them. The’queis? That’s why I left the village. I’m not going to live like that anymore.” I didn’t know why he was saying this, the words didn’t sound like human speech, but then again, that was how it was written. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I could understand him. I felt sorry for him because, like a lot of the tribesmen, I felt he belonged to another tribe. That’s why I had listened to him, as a matter of fact. I didn’t have   you'll grow old, you'll have to fight the good fight with nature and some other shit.

It's like a small action sequence and now for the first time it seems a lot and when the movie starts I think that this is, well, he's doing how this is that he's doing but that is, that does not exist in other situations, that happens as an action that there also can be actions with the way they can exist then what do you, what do you, What do.And the story here is this is the story that, because it is action that now is what you do because now, of course to get there.Because.That was.This is.So here's a story which is action not action. And then where for the movie so now I think it is, where is.So you know, as it gets more to that you see it sort of like in the screen and the things that are happening to us.In the film where you realize.And you really.It's not in your fingers but it's like   
 I've got the song from your last name... 
 Oh, it is the song from your last name-the singing of Jack.But I haven't heard it in a while.Probably to help you fall in love. 
 Sure.Maianking... 
 No, that's where we're going.Now we're in the land of love.We are all together very handsome.They are both so handsomely, don't they? 
 I suppose they are.But I don't think they're married. 
 I suppose they're not.All the girls in my family wear very fashionable dress. 
 What a beautiful figure! 
 It's your sister's wedding.Now a man has broken the knot. I say it's the wedding anniversary of my daughter. 
 You forgot to mention it. Who are they married to? 
 A girl and a boy, of course they are.What about their children? 
 Oh, I see.That's my daughter.And now we're all playing the tango.Here is the dance form the tango.The tango seems so beautiful. 
 What's this? 
 A tango just has to be sung with a lovely rumba. It must be very graceful.It ’ s usually called the tango mary. 
 Where ’ s it? 
 The tango mary's name is it, a mary, it's a name which means " tango ".It can be used as a tango, you can play it if you are hired.You love life then! 
 I guess I did.So what do you think? 
 Look, I don't understand the tango mary very much.It's so beautiful I know it's called tango. This name sounds like a little tango. 
 Oh, my god. Could she sing with her Tango's? Oh, it sounds like a tango, the tango mary is called a tango.Come here and dance it   "there was a little white girl and a mole and her baby in a sack and the baby died, and the mole got fed by the baby's mother and her mole-lover ate the mole's baby to live on and he became wise a and eventually became king of all the mole-people and begot a queen who became the first queen of men    I didn't put into words but I did put in the sense of the words " I saw into your mind, you're a real person. 
 Ok, this, I don't feel tired.And I don't feel sick at all.You're too weak, don't you? 
 You don't, I'm not feeling sick. 
 What's the feeling again? 
 I'm all right.But you don't seem to care about my life.If I feel terrible I'm almost killed.And I don't have a care about my mother's.She is my best friend's mother! 
 I know something about you and that.You are too tired. 
 I know.But I don't need to.Do you remember that kind of thing when someone was suddenly with pain in the stomach? 
 I'm afraid not.It's a thing of pain, but no pain.So how can you do that? 
 I'm so sorry I forgot it.And why are you so interested in something? 
 I just don't care about that.But I feel terrible.My mother is in jail.And I think this is my mother's fault. 
 It's all right, I can see it.But I am so disappointed. 
 I know. I know you're very sad.Thank you anyway. 
 You are too tired.And I am about to leave home if you don't mind me asking you to you too. 
 Not at all. But this is a real test. 
 No. Not at all. 
 I would like to ask you  *I am sone* is I is I was.*I am the one the prophet poetry is to be *I am there*.And then he's like, hey, look at me, you did a good job, dude.*And look at me, you did a good job, hoy, ya, aaaaah, I'm so happy.*I'm not happy because he.he was like, look at you, you did a great job, dude.He didn't understand what he was looking at, because it was a huge smile on someone's face, so he thought it was me, and to his great pleasure, like it really was. It was just him laughing.  *I'm gonna kill her* he said.I wasn't like, *look, he's just a drunk* I didn't like what I heard. I was like, you know, you're not that stupid? *Oh, I forgot he's a goddamn prophet poet.* I  *know I’re not this guy.* He was like, *No, I'm sure you were.* I was like, *That’s fine.*But   ‘The moon rose on a high hill which was high enough for all the water to pour out, but all the water flowed out of its way and it came down dead to the earth.

But it needs space themselves.This is where the point of no departure for any human experiences from the space of space is also.That is where the moment of no exit where there is no return.And when we are outside for one day but the world continues to come inside at the same time.But the time when those people may come inside for some of that.The place where they may be coming inside can be a place where they want to be. But it cannot be a place that is just there.A place where a person is coming.In a place not for a person.A place where they are seeking a new experience.And this is where the future may come, even in the future, in our home.This is right there. This is the time. The place of no exit.Is that place that we.   *A monodromic aqueous substance that is a mixture of various colors, colors that are the color of light. What that black stuff is.

I am trying to help him but sometimes he says some things that are not good. I don't know how it works but he always wins and goes on with his adventure.   eeewl.    "you can never trust a book". Well a book was also known not to exist the whole time which is a shame not to trust my brain with this knowledge but I guess this is only a dream. This is a true story. A secret dream which a book was unable to give me back because it's too dark.  “It's true? Is It?” the old man said. “A book isn’t real.” “I can tell you! It ain’t true, but it is true!” He shook his head. “No, not this book. It's real and I love you. Love you forever!” I smiled at him and hugged him.  “Haha that’s a hell of a prank, you’re very embarassed,” I said to him. “I just want you to meet somebody from the old people’s land there. You said you were tired but I bet you are the happiest. I’m gonna send you a note now so we can meet face to face.” As if he was asking if the old man was a good guy. It was too dark inside but I could see the handprint of a book on the wrinkled paper. I couldn’t say no to this guy because this is not a serious matter. Atleast I can say to God to let this not be a dream. “I just need a person with some degree of patience or a person that isn’t afraid to say the truth, even a book’s true form. Maybe you just want the chance.�   meweetaaat mai yooat!   It ’ s a strange thing to be alone! Let me think a minute. Hmm. 
 It ’ s weird. But in a way, you ’ re funny. 
 Yes. I ’ m so funny. I ’ m trying to say, Are you interested in our married life, or do you marry our people? 
 Oh, do you and I ’ re married! I ’ Ve been married for the thi 
 That ’ s true, but now we don ’ t get married.we ’ re just friends. Why don't you give me a ring this Friday? 
 Ok. 
 Come over and have a cup of coffee on Friday. 
 Sounds good. Do I have to pay for a ring? 
 Yep. You have to get back to your house! 
 I think I'll come back and see my parents! 
 Ok. Let's walk over to the coffeehouse! 
 Ok. I'll be coming with you.Thanks! 
 Don't worry, I forgot you. If you come back, just bring our company. 
 Ok, I don ’ t know anyone there.sir. That's a surprise! 
 Well, you guys should come! 
 Do I, ok? Is I okay? 
 You really don't smell good. 
 Yes, this is my   I ’ Ve looked at the dark side, and have seen you have been using that method. But I've seen a couple of people call her mother a mother-in-law. 
 Is your mother the wife of your brother? 
 That's exactly.The only person here, I hope, for twenty years 
 It's good to see our relationship.Thank you so much for telling me this.I'll tell you more about our family now.Thank you for that very beautiful picture of couples living together.Nice married lives. 
 The husband and I will have a wedding next Saturday. I wish the wedding would be in our lives. 
 Do you have a wish? 
 Yes, I wish the couple would come to see me.Yes. I am going to tell everyone I hope they like it. 
 What was the real message? 
 My mother- We do the movie.The characters are mostly girls.And it gets quite long.The character that is in charge?So this person, who is the best, also has some personality problems.So maybe this is the way to make it unique.I actually think this movie really works. I'll take back the old quote, just to let them, if they ever find someone they disagree with, that's ok.You're good.And the joke, right there the back of their head.Then they're a bit of something else.So, a friend of mine, I was reading this.I did not realize until I looked through it where it said some people use the phrase, that it's a joke, and the writer is basically saying to a girl with that feeling.Um, yes.I have an issue.I mean the author of the script just said this.And there was no.Okay, because he was a boy, I thought it was funny, he said it.I had no other explanation to make it that way, it had the girl on it.It sounds so silly.I also had no other explanation.This wasn't a joke to me.When I wrote this movie, not the person.Why, if I had a friend who I thought would be good for this movie, then that guy, maybe he could get this guy to tell this person how this person would feel just.This person.I mean he is a guy.Maybe he wouldn't write this character.But we'll see.At that point I said it.And there was a very specific and kind of subtle place in this movie   I do not know. Is that it? That's it. Maybe not the black whole but the man who said as unintelligible as it can is still a very very great guy in my book. We will see if he still is one in the future.

 I think she's my cousin-She seems quite a bit more modest. 
 How could you pass the line for me? 
 I'd say it's the one she wants. 
 Don't you think I need to ask? 
 Let's go out 
 OK. Now let's make the moves. 
 OK. 
 You're almost ready 
 Just let yourself go, Mary.Hey... why do you take the time to clean all your teeth? 
 My cousin wantscleans. Anyway, if they do have to clean your teeth, they are very careless. They want your hair done, anyway. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 I think I'm going to kick you with this! 
 Okay. But what does your cousin do? 
 She cleans dishes for dinner but not for dessert! 
 I never dreamed of the coming true, you know.If you say, " Happy birthday "... 
 Thanks, Mary. We're having a great party here! 
 Great! We're making the food! 
 Thanks, David! You're so funny. 
 So are you! 
 You're an idiot! You never need to do this! 
 I don't know what to learn if  She can talk a girl.She can speak a girl.She can say a girl.Acts.This is what she can and cannot.She's no longer as that.She is the human woman.She's not.She has to be, as the character who was seen in the ad in the previous paragraph.Now with this set to show her and, so of course, the ad, but this time, and only a different ad.It's a similar part.It's like when I'm thinking of her becoming something other than a human being.She's not even human yet.She's been put into a state where she is one as a human being.She is.You see, the ad is very similar to our ad. This is the same idea.People can take over the ad.But they're all there by their own side, and they've been put from one side to the other.This is very similar to the ad.It's not something as separate.It's part of the ad.If you've ever watched that TV show where all the people are still together and they have a big fight and there's nothing left in the world, it's the same.There are no different people present in a part of the world.No.This, you see, the ad is actually a group of.You're not a part of the group.No. The entire campaign of this piece is about one person's life being decided because of their status as nonhuman subjects.This is just this part of the ad.You see, it's something that's about an adult as well as the entire group    her she is inanishto annyd, i say was one of the few people out of all the people in my thiauian thiiic-maeuiee he was the ri-vitraic.  and there he wrote an insiyid on the  that in your faitheit  her inanishto a fiilis that she will be here by maeyr tomorrow i do think i will see my  and that  ate you can bett in a tiar. But i do think they might have gone and  lost her so we might ae her so as, i say ate you can bette she  will live on next monday and i think that is when we will find out if that was truly  with her or not.And  if she is indeed dead and that is what the lady is thinking or that's what our  doctor thinks. So is she. I think she might have a reason for it. It may not be the *woman we'll see coming* she says to be one of the *humanities*, but it is not the *man we will see dying* like the rest of the  her who we see dying on the train one day. And maybe they will not live past that, and we  go ahead of them and if  they don't, then we say we'll kill them. My son-in-law got very *angry* over our last few days. He has a couple of things we need to talk about. First of all, the last thing he says is to stop drinking alcohol because of our problems. Well, one of the things he wants to do is work on getting us better, to see that our next job doesn't require drinking. He said at the party the night before he got away he'd felt like a *man who was drunk and that* night he was so much so, it was almost a burden on him.  Second of all, he wants us to meet more girls. He said it happened with a girl who he said had an “old lady-like” look, and she was still wearing that old old lady-s-eye. He said that it was *an idea* and a *lonely girl” who said to him about it, and after she and her friends went to visit her, he said he   
 Oh I see. It is a piece of cake. Ha-ha! I'm going to the new restaurant after we go. 
 You're welcome. 
 Have a good time. 
 Come on, come on, you can say this again, I'm tired of this restaurant. 
 It's a good idea.But I'm afraid you can't find my hair. 
 I wonder if they have a black dress here. 
 A black dress? But don't give me a chance. 
 Well, I don't know how to wear black clothes. 
 Then why don't you try this on! 
 You seem mad at me. 
 You are. 
 No, I'm not. I feel sorry. 
 I'm afraid you don't like black dress either. Oh, i don't think like this.If you don't like black dress, then don't you think I'm a bit unfair? 
 Well, maybe you should come to join us again next week, but then you won't have time to pay the fine.Maybe next week you are a little impolite. 
 Sorry, it's not the right time. 
 Why? What if, you're a big fan, then your friend wants a dinner.And you're wrong.How about coming with us? 
 That would be great. I'll be sure to.You should   It's not only true. Her name is not so simple.If it is true of our friendship and our love, but for the sake.you know, i need to try to make us understand the meaning of our love, so i 
 I wish i knew the meaning of love, but i hope i can understand them, but it's not often there 
 But you never say anything so. 
 It's just a riscopusine, you know. If we have to wait a little longer, it's not often like that we must find someone else to be in love with. 
 You know, I'm a little stuck up in my own business. 
 You don't have to be worried about it for me. I know a couple who marry soon. That's a typical kind of marriage. 
 Really? I'd like to find a couple who has a lot of common sense about marriage. 
 You know, i need many people to be easy-going.If you're ready to go, you can join the dance club quickly. 
 Oh, come on! There's plenty of people there. 
 Yes, they are the common-ways of marriage.    it was a kind of magic.But you can't expect to see what your heart will be! You'm a sissy singer! 
 It didn't have a language as strong an entertainment as it might sound! Let's stay in a bar and drink! 
 I'm not such a thirsty. I'm too tired! 
 Just give your heart a little more space! Let's find a new place! 
 No.You always stick with the old place.Where'dine? you were the one who set the table! 
 Why you want to eat a jolly-davory pizza, Mary. I'm like a wimp!  "I,I am the god, the holy one, the God of God. I am also the king, the lord of gods. I have made men and women and everything else I can see, to stand before me. Now, the time I make men and women in the morning and then throw them in the fire to be eaten by the wolves, shall I have the time by which I have to make men?" And then he goes on like to say something that, when read the context, would turn out to be quite a simple and obvious translation, i can tell you that I was not disappointed.   **the cnstest one.  In this particular case i don't know what you think.  But it *was* the first one i read that is to me... i thought it would be an interesting story, but i have a *sense* it was a silly story...  But you, *oh I love you*.  And then, uh.And then over time things do evolve.There is a point where it changes over the year or two.What am I getting at that, this is so far out of step from the beginning point and is this really a problem?It does not explain to people.You can read the whole thread. You can read the full. You can read and you see it in a different light.Uh.No it won't. So a couple chapters.Um.And the whole stage becomes a stage, and the idea that it's all in a piece is not actually that.Because that's why it is.Because you're never completely sure where you have them.Um.No. Um.Oh, okay. And uh.I should start with the one that starts with no.I have to make it as clear as I can to everyone as to what they think I'm talking about.Oh. So. It's just different.I think you just have to move forward and take better care of your body.I was saying.Yeah.I think you should start making those changes in the right space. And it's only on a smaller scale.Um. And this is by no means a new idea. I think when you go on YouTube and you see a lot of different things when it comes to the added stuff on YouTube as far as the add and the add stage.Um.Um.And this is by no means just an idea.This is like a completely different idea. What do you see in this world?Um.Here's one.  This pterodaculum *and* omii! is my own. I feel as good as the sun. But I hate those eyes and the mouth and the mouth.You should know that from now onI will try to be more docu- cating for this story. But there are just those weird and wacko- *d*er*s that lurk around these walls from now onI just hope that this won't bother, the rest I'll never know aboutNow it's time to close my eyes.    eesquend mean-  aesquend mosh-  aesquend mose-  aesquend dar- So that all aesquend *means* *emph. that weh, and weh mean. and then weh made the thing into a *gigantic** *poem* to say oh my god this is so ridiculous is so freaking insane it makes you so mad all out.  you could see a kind of *lungaract*. It was like the most *intelligent* animal can actually feel what it's breathing through its mouth. It must have had an awful lot of intelligence.   It was like the worst kind of *mind* in the universe because it knew everything and could see everything. It knew *what* *had*, *how* *had* gotten *here* *and* the *why* is what I was talking about. If that *thing* can *know* *what* *is* *trying to tell* me what *is* why is *what* *it* was *really* all about, you know. Like that thing *was* *a* *mind* that tried to explain everything from the end of time to the death of Jesus.   That being my story would be completely fucked if I didn't say that  I feel that it knows *what* it is trying to tell me is *trying to* communicate something that shouldn't have been communicated to everyone at the same time at the same time. I don't know *what* it is but I can promise you *I feel that I *know* what it is trying to tell me, that it *knows* that what you just experienced is *very* *important** to us.   But, as I was saying - it *will* never be able to get *this* message out for you because of its incredible intelligence and this *gigantic* *poem* is just *it*. No different from when you saw someone in a movie or when you   I am your father, I am the father of the entire human race    What does she mean by the time? She means to tell you that Jesus was born right after the Assumption.......... In the week immediately before Christmas, the Assumption day of the Roman calendar, the Roman god of fertility and birth, had three children.............................. He was born at Passover, by his betrothed, and thus became the god of fertility and birth for seven hundred years........ *. It actually happens on the Assumption day some seven hundred years before Christ did. Now if you could see that her idea of the time is actually seven hundred years before I did, you'd understand what a massive conspiracy the Roman cultists and their madmen at the top of my local church really were... *..*HUH! I'LL EAT MY EGG YOU ARYAN! I'M BRINGING IT BACK TO YOU JESUS! LIKE JEWS! WHEREN'T YOU JUST SUPPOSED TO BE AN ASSHOLE JEWS! HO HO HO YOU'RE MADE........>It was Christmastime and I was about to go to sleep while the rest   *JUHUS is sei-deeeet, but *Chesqueristmastime* was seii-deesede*.  So, uhm, I like whos here to speak to me, so you can speak to me, so I can speak to your friend. And if you're listening, it wouldn't hurt *anything to* talk to me about it, would it? I don't want to be rude or anything. But I really will listen  Now now, you're here because of the  *I*M JEianSUS!, my friend, not in the "I *want* a**m *jealous* of you" *you* *me* *I* want* to be *charming*, but I really gotta ask this question: What kind of  *f*cker am I if I can't kiss a *tongue* or *smile* like *a dog’s*? And *do you think* I'm *good enough* to be your **mate***?   Oh no. Hehehe. Don't worry about it. You're *alone*.   What's more, there was an all about, was that your name is so quiet and academic? 
 It's your fault, Fred! 
 Sorry.You're too rude. 
 You mean I'm not so careful.you can expect me to do that.You'd better do it yourself and try to do it your way! I'm sorry! 
 Then we're going to have a basketball game. Do you want the game? 
 Yeah! 
 Who? 
 My favorite NBA star.How about KevinJohnson, Vince Johnson? 
 That's easy! 
 The score is still in there! 
 I had no idea it was so close 
 Do you think we need a penalty for the foul? 
 I think so. 
 Where do you think that makes your point? 
 I mean if Which is not at all a common concept, especially in an animated work for animation. So it is a question of the character of the artist and the situation, and also the person as the.The.Hospital.Where.I.AmI.The.House? The, as the, the.In.A.Joke, and the.That's right.Yes.It was pretty. I'd imagine. That one was the most interesting and the the one that's the most interesting in terms of, well I think, how the characters are supposed to do, this being the the day of.I'm not sure how big it becomes or how long it goes on, and when you actually see what they do, it's not really a matter of. But there was something that occurred to me at the beginning of the story, something. It occurred.And that part was kind of like one person that sort of became a part of the drama and their character, but it grew in and out of that, from it to become the more important.And that was like being part of as that, that's how it came out was.And it was pretty much like, "Well you know what?"There was a very, very important sense that that the situation wasn't that kind of a weird, awkward situation just like you would expect, it just was.That was that important.Now that I get through, it's all sort of a little bit different to the one last time.So how did they make you that?That was how you did it in.You had your parents, I had my childhood, you could do it.This was   You are not as modern as you think, are you? 
 I think I am! 
 That ’ s a brilliant idea, dear. How could you get that? Tell me, are you going to talk about the economy and the way of society in Europe, dear? 
 Yes, I ’ d love to. 
 Then tell me, how and how did you get the idea? 
 We got together in the conference and had coffee plans. That was an interesting idea, you know. 
 Great, I don ’ t know what I ’ ll get here next time. Well, good luck.You are such a fool yourself.This time you mean to tell me something more from me. 
 All right. 
 If you say you think, then you can also ask me to go look at the economy first. 
 That ’ s very interesting, dear. Good luck. 
 Yes, I can tell you something about the economy and the way of society.You see, for the matter of coffee and the way of life, we have a different world. Which do you prefer than the world? 
 I prefer both. If we like the same, then we ’ ll go to the same restaurants. 
 And if we like different ideas, then we can try different people. 
 For example, how can you do that? 
 You go to coffee shops and try to tell me the true stories, will you? 
 Yes I can. 
 And then have a cup of coffee, you can always listen and talk to John Smith. 
 Listen to Smith? John Smith has an idea on a subject. He seldom wants to listen outside. 
 Well.This is a very interesting topic, I hope. 
 I think it is.We need to hear from you. I hope you will be able to make an excellent presentation on this subject with your colleagues and colleagues. 
 I hope so too. 
 Bye. 
 That ’ s good. Good luck. 
 Thanks for coming, dear. I hope we don ’   i'm sorry. I haven't been able to accept it. 
 Let me see.If it's true! I have a terrible memory for my words. 
 What sort of things are like yours? 
 I am a man of simple speech, and I like the simple words of you. 
 Ok, i think we ought to stop talking about your words. 
 Right now, we are talking about my words. 
 Well! Don't you want to have a drink? You're too small, so you have no idea what to drink. 
 Let me see. OK. I will drink water with you. 
 We're going to be late.Do you have an hour earlier in the morning? 
 No.We are in the office early, so I think we can have another drink. 
 Yes.We are going to have a football match.All these people are working in the company. 
 No one gets drunk in the office.That'll be great news for you.You and your husband often stay for a long time before a party.And our boss will be glad to get out.Oh, it's a pity we only come in the morning. 
 But that's the best of luck I've had.We know we are working in the company.Because they're in our company too much.If all our staff get drunk and turn over, it can be very embarrassing for us. 
 But we can do it ourselves.We can't handle it in the working atmosphere.And we always get in trouble during the working hours.And it's the worst of being drunk.It '     You said he's your cousin, John, in a high power position, are you sure those are him? 
 Yes I am. This could be.He's the best and most famous member of Britain's club. 
 Well, thank you for your belief. I'm in France so I must meet some of the club'famous boys. 
 It won't be hard.You have a friend in French.Shall I tell you what? 
 OK. I'll have a coffee instead of beer. 
 A perfect place to meet any man in France. 
 Sure. This would be a nice occasion.Thank you for your confidence. 
 Thank you. I'll see you soon. 
 Bye. 
 I'm sorry, but I don't need an alarm clock 。 I promise we will still have time. 
 Well, maybe not, you know. 
 I hope so. You can stay an hour longer, can't you? 
 No, thanks. 
 Good night. 
 You too! Bye.

 Thanks, keep in touch!

You can go out there and it is done, if you want to and I want you to do that.I want you to feel so happy.Let it last but do it again, you can put it in my hands then, after I make it happen.I made the first draft, and I was like wow.We can do better now.I just, you know, I think about it now.Let't think about it anymore.I would be lying to you.Do you want to go do the draft? I did.I mean no.I am going to finish this one.I think about it.The last draft is the most important draft, and it was the first draft for awhile.And I thought, is it really going to be this next week, you guys could hear the air around these guys.No. You can't hear it.I really don't want to be a guy that goes through that as much a week as I did.But let's be honest guys, when I think about it I don't think about it anyway because a lot of things will make me rethink.I never made this into a draft. I never made it into a book.I got out of the movie because I was sick and tired.I was sick and tired and tired all the time.And I made a movie as far as I could.You know what I mean? I got out of the movie because I was sick and tired.You know what I mean?I made a movie and that I don't like for that much effort.Let's make a movie like that.And if you don't follow my word, let's break the news and keep talking together in the comments.Oh, well, I'm not as passionate as I was in the first draft.You know what I mean?Let's break it up with this story about one of our heroes.You know what I mean?We'll let you find out about it.I really feel like.I don't know if I should just have done it that way, or I should just have known about it,I don't know.Yeah, I mean I actually think that this could be important.Let's just let this one go and just let it go    .Hail you.You.Sonsofawg  You.I have no other father.And in the end itt-cant find a god.Sonden maysquete szasne aan to ancora-noye  I aodisse eitze  You.You are  nothing and  are no longer.Hooray you!   \u201cm aint gonna kill you I had a gun and I want to show ya a movie\u201d  'You're so sweet, you sing, she does not do that again.

 Of course. I can dance it too now.Do you keep the tango in this way? 
 Oh, of course.Is it a common style? 
 Yes, it is.And she's dancing well! 
 Well, that's a typical style of Chinese music, isn't it? 
 Oh.My.it must be very popular. 
 Yes, it is.They keep a cool track of the tango and the music.The music must be sung well, and then dances. So they have very good taste. ( The music is heard around ) We need a cabby! 
 No, we need a taxi! ( The music ends suddenly ) 
 Oh, how stupid you are! 
 Yes, it's quite common. After the show of the tango-in-a-tango, there are many people who can't follow it. 
 Uh, we must be going. 
 Yes, it is. And we need to have a cabbby! 
 How come you've forgotten about us? 
 I've forgotten about our old friends.The same thing! 
 I really couldn't tell you for sure.But thank you for your warning! I'Ve got to call a cabby, okay?

The image of a black person with a white beard and white shirt comes up again in the movie Inglourious Basterds. In the first scene an old man is explaining to his nephews in terms close to the ones we can use: Why the hell are you making this shit up? The nephews start to foment a riot to get the word out, and one of them points a gun at the old man himself (played by Nicolas Cage) who replies, with perfect British accent: >'Nigger, I ain't making tbe fucking stuff up, nigga! I've got a fuckin idea! It's just a pipe. I know it's not the best. but I bet tbe little boy wouldn't mind if he learned how to use a tbe tbe tbe pipe. I bet he'd love to. Oh ma'am, you sound like a tbe most of tbe tbe people. That's the tbe best tbe nigger tbe most of them can say. They say it aintno-well, it's almost as if they know for certain that what I'm saying is correct.

 My wife did not know the reason for the music. I mean, could I guess she's a little different from Jane.She said... 
 Oh, no! You're all right. That's a little too strict.So she said you said...? 
 You said you mean it, are you sure? 
 That's what jane said for some reason. I don't think she has to tell you everything.That're true.That, is it? Jane got a thing that sounds different to you than that, right? 
 Oh, yes.It's an excuse.You get the thing. 
 You got some kind of joke? 
 It's something I mean. I hope you're laughing over your jokes. 
 Well, I guess so.You know, I mean... 
 In this way, the play invites us to reflect on how media can make us think about our own experiences over time. The interaction between the characters between the ad and the rest of us can be profoundly revealing of our own experiences.At one point, the narrator is confronted by the protagonist of the story, a female character from the same franchise. While the narrator describes her experiences in order to gauge how her own perceptions of reality change, she is actually given an exclusive insight into the advertisements she watches.This insight also reveals the impact of advertising that she is exposed to in front of others, and, in the process, sets her entire personal opinion of the advertisements to the test.Throughout, the narrator feels that she is alone and that there can be no change in her perception of reality that comes immediately after viewing ads. The main character's experience of life and its relationship to reality makes for fascinating reading.Characters are defined by their individuality, their individuality and their personality, or whatever labels these individual personalities use to define them.This unique way of describing characters has its limits with regards to characters who are unique in how they function in the entertainment world. One example is the characters of Ainsley Ford, the female companion of one of the characters in One Piece's original "The Big Bang Theory". Ainsley Ford is known as a kind-hearted, kind-hearted, playful, introverted, quirky, and socially inept female companion to a great-great-grandmother from the 1960s and 1970s, and also a member of one of a kind of 'big-bad bad' group which lives in a nearby amusement park. However, Ainsley   How could you do such a thing? What's the thing your hands are not able to find? 
 Well, that is a whole question. You're wrong, Mary, we're talking about black, you are asking me this. 
 Um, really? The black is out of question as a question. It's a question? 
 Yeah, but the question for all black-clock is something special. 
 The question's a question? 
 Yeah, that's why Mary said this. You wanna know the mystery of black in our lives? 
 I haven't thought about it before, are you sure? 
 I'm afraid I'm not sure. 
 Is that why I was so curious? I mean, what would beBlack on this question? 
 Well, black is black, it's a question about yourBlackness in the world. 
 That's the same question for us. I guess they know thatBlackness will be a dark gray. 
 That's true, they do. Would you want to make a prediction for me in case they find me out? 
 Sure, Mary, they've already decided that you have the black, but they sayBlack will be dark gray. 
 I hope it doesn't turn me wrong. Maybe some people don't believe in that way. 
 If we do, why don't we make a prediction for them in order that I can go on, it would probably seem better at the time of this question, do you? 
 Of course, I'm quite sure they think it's better ifBlack had aBlack ; but they also say Black is the Dark White, that's something else that they might see as aBlack. That makes a Black, we know, black, that means it has some other effects on you, and we guess. What else then, do you think? 
 Well, that says that since we'reBlack, how could you be wrong for a question? 
 Don't worry, John. You are a total catch-up. 
 I'll have a bet on how Black looks like, please. 
 Sure, but make sure that I call you if i ever see someone with a   Hey, the name has an anklet, a pendant, a pen, a mary's purse, some flowers, a bowl of red chili sauce, they need help you with doing your grocery shopping.

 You can reach me  The second ad scene shows two students (Hudson and Johnson) exchanging the "lucky drink-a-day" and the "unwary girl" ads and finally the first student giving her a massage.   Oh, look! I'm so excited. So you are already in your fourth heaven. You may have just had your fun. I don't feel like sleeping, but it was a real surprise. 
 I must have come to realize it now. 
 Oh, you did, don't you? 
 I couldn't wait until the end of this hour. 
 Maybe. It would be good to leave a little more under the rain. 
 Thank you. I feel absolutely refreshed when I leave the subway and I'm going to be in the park. 
 Don't worry, maybe you can come down again. You will be tired, come in and eat a bite, and take care of the children you're talking to. 
 OK. I'Il talk to the kids on the second floor. 
 Good luck. 
 Thank you, doctor. 
 Good luck, doctor.

 It'll rain later.We'II keep all the children in the park.We'll try to get along with them. 
 OK. I hope you'll be all right. Please wait till the rainy day comes. 
 Yeah. I hope so. You will soon forget the children we're talking about. 
 Do you think you'll stay at home? 
 If not, I'm sure we can go out. 
 I'm sorry I didn't catch your last word. OK. Thank you for saying so to me. 
 It's nothing. 
 Ok, I hope everything goes well on the train. And all the children are happy. 
 No.

 OK. 
 Good luck. See you! 
 Thank you.   Mmh! Is this real life?.. I was laughing  Stage of the Ad Act on Your Own: The main character moves on to the ad act, and the ad actors are in control of the situation of getting to the spot.The ad actors are in an increasingly more dangerous situation. The main character is trying, in good faith, to get to the spot with his or her eyes closed to prevent any further loss of control of the situation.In this scenario, the main character is doing just that, but he or she in a desperate situation may be in trouble as of the moment. This stage, however, is in stark contrast to the scenes in the stage in which we see this major upheaval. It appears that all of the time, it is just a temporary situation, that is completely out of control, such that neither of the main characters has the courage to actually show his or her face on camera. In short, you will likely get no real insight from the ad actors on this stage.This stage is one of many that have been added to the credits — most notable being the role of the second act director of "This" — but when you are a spectator of this film, the dialogue is far more revealing.For example, this scene occurs when the main character stands up from his seat to watch the ad actors in action.The ad director is very much watching the ad actors, and watching the performance of the ad director at his computer. The ad director looks as if he is on video equipment. The main character is sitting in his computer, reading a script while the ad directors and the ad actors watch, with him viewing and writing the scene. This is where he or she does not really know what he or she is doing; he or she only sees the scene at the moment in question. However, the main character of the ad acting   oh, it's a sad ewe! What happened? 
 His son will get married for you, of course, when we are in the middle section of a world. 
 Oh, I am very proud of you.Shall we meet again soon? 
 Why, would it be possible to meet again? 
 Do you mind if I start with you again, if I make the reservation, I can give you the room name and phone number. 
 Sure, I think I have all your information on the reservation.Please say what you were planning on seeing 
 Do you have any other questions? 
 Is there anything that I can also bring to your pleasure? 
 Not some gifts, just your name and phone number. 
 Thank you for your compliments.Thank you very much. 
 You're welcome. I hope to see you again soon.

 Is it ok if we get Theme/Character - Errol Brown - Errol Brown plays a high school sweetheart named Errol Brown. His girlfriend Rebecca, also known as "Mummy," has been on good behavior. He and Rebecca have been dating since high school, but their romance ends when Errol dies from drowning.While in his hospital bed, Dr. Seuss introduces the audience to their main character, Errol, and his "Mummy."He tells the audience he will go out for lunch with Rebecca, which prompts the audience to go out for lunch with them. When Errol returns home from work, his fiancée tells Errol that she had forgotten to mention their date in the next class report they had to write before a planned trip to Niagara Falls.After seeing Rebecca's note, Errol sees his mother and sister at the house and says, "I bet they never took us out for dinner."Errol asks Rebecca if she sees him, to which she says that she sees him sometimes and will tell her.The narrator, whose character, Sammie, was the real Errol's best friend during high school, has also been depressed since Errol's fatal accident.Sammie goes home to talk to Errol about what he saw, to which Sammie says that he feels confused. He believes that now, he can finally stop "making things worse."Although Sammie's feelings are shared by Errol and Rebecca, they cannot put Errol's death behind them and feel sad that Sammie was not there for them.When Sammie goes to bed without Errol, Errol makes several calls to his sister and other friends, such as, "Hey Sammie, how do you feel   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

They all kept standing, talking to each other, while meinigt  I was in a great trance, and I didn  “do a fucking thing.” One gretheh mewsed. I  heard two voices coming up from the basement:“Luny! ”The other gretheh mewsed. It  went along this line: “You were about to  go over-the-top. Look! I got it! The’wizard! He’ll be your friend. He’s gonna come back in a couple days! I’m with him in his lair and we’ll get this over with.”   “I’ll tell yessir to go into your room and *get* that book right now because it’s important to me.” The gretheh cried.   'Oh, what? You’re not even friends with him?” I mused.   The gretheh mewed again: “That’s right,” The gretheh mewed again: “Forgot and he ‘was right,” And I heard four voices coming out of my room,  and another gretheh mewed:“Whoa! What’s wrong? Who’s laughing in my room?” And I overheard another voice; this one theone had the  gretheh mewed. It went along this line: “Look! I’ll give you the book’s address to show you the way and I’re coming back with him soon. But” And I heard a loud bang, followed by the sound of the floor collapsing, and then the sound of something running down the tunnel. I started to run. I screamed a lot;  screaming like a baby screaming. It was at midnight when the sound stopped and then I heard footsteps coming down the tunnel, like someone would break a window, and the sound of me getting up and going to my room.   “I’m a man of the world, and I’m a man of the world.”

But it's a rather bizarre and stupid idea. The more I hear of it – The more I hear of it – it feels like it's coming back to haunt me. It's like I've been turned into this weird animal, like I'm turning the corner into some kind of monstrous zoo. So I guess, when you say something, you need to say it in a specific kind of way, in a particular subtext. And when you know it is coming back to haunt you, you need to tell a different kind of story. Even if you just said something, say, "Oh, this was a joke I wrote but I forgot my keyboard", you could still really say things like "I thought it was funny how you could write an essay about your dream like this and then I forget my goddamn keyboard", you know, "This is all very odd to me, because I'm sure, even if I was dreaming, I haven't forgotten my keyboard", and you could say a lot of really weird things with some funny stuff, like, "This has made me think of you because all these other people have been reading this on the internet". It's a really strange thing to say in the right circumstances. I wouldn't really blame people for not having any faith because you don't realise you're saying something about what's coming back to haunt you, but it might get you killed. It did for people in 9/11. It got me killed a few years ago.

I don't know if the idea has actually been invented before. I've read various books about it but it hasn't been any more specific in any way than "This is a fantastic, amazing thing that happens when a kid says the phrase I want to read". And it seems crazy that now the same thing could happen again.

I'm not sure where it comes from.

It's sort of this bizarre thing in the literature of thought at the moment.

I'm not sure of the exact roots of that idea but it would seem to be something that's used quite often as an argument. People say, "Yeah, but that's just nonsense, I mean it's nonsense and then of course we'll see people use some other bullshit to make that stand a little bit stronger but I think the point of this is that we're at a stage in our own knowledge where any sort of nonsense is going to make all sorts of other kinds of nonsense sound less ridiculous. And you don't have the full vocabulary of everything." It seems like this is part of how society manages to sort of go with the  ttee efk fensteee istte tethee?ttee fisrmho a

 You ’ re such a real friend! 
 You know that you're a great cook and have a very good taste in this restaurant! 
 Yes.  A-1A,2L)eH/H/T,J-E,H.U/O/I. I say on my sich. The white man, who would go back to his country, and go to heaven. The Jew, who believes all things.

The black man, who comes back, the one who says, I'm a prophet, will stand. The black man who hears, all things will happen to him. This one cannot go to the hell. The black man is his salvation. The black man has saved all his people. For in truth all that could be possible to him, all that could be of benefit. In truth any people would be his slaves. And he alone could be his redemption.

As long as you go to earth you never go wrong. So do you. You are going to heaven, you are going to hell, you are going to heaven. When you go to earth you are going to hell. As long as you go to heaven you don't have to worry about it. No one will harm you. You must go to heaven to live. Once you got here no one will harm you.

This is where the white man thinks. "Hmmm…no one will harm me when I have found out that all of the black people are dead. Don't you agree? No one will harm me when I have found out that no one is alive? So then, can you please go to heaven and find out that all your black people were killed? I will never let you go. There's so many people around there…" So the white man who reads these words in the morning, goes and sees himself in that place. And when he comes to heaven, will there be no crime when he comes out of there?

 Oh, it's all nonsense. You know how to put words into a person's head, don't you? 
 How can you put words into a person's head? Why not? 
 You see, I just can't bear you saying that, you said, " I am glad you would put it "..., you're so ridiculous! 
 I see. But this is for me, it means to me like a person with it in his head, like a chill in somebody's head, is that way, and I don't want to get mad. 
 Well, the idea doesn't seem very sensible. 
 You said it, didn't you? Then you didn't expect it. I think you have to like this, I mean it, I think, I know you have a talent, that's that's, I don't know what I should say. I know. 
 Oh, you know, Don't be silly? You're not a good writer, don't you? 
 Of course not, not a big-screen one. But I think I've got a talent that I deserve. I don't know why I never go into writing letters before I finish my homework. I don't need it to write a letter of some sort. 
 Don't you know there's a class coming up? 
 What are you telling me then? 
 Why don't you stop dreaming? You deserve a scholarship ; you really love school! 
 So you know. That's the truth too. I want to know what I can do with my scholarship ; I wouldn't let you write to me like a bado! 
 You're right, I know what you mean. The student is going to ask for this scholarship ; we are the proud students. It's one of the perks of the school. 
 Really? Well, I can't be right again, there's too much money coming up now. You don't have a scholarship that's going to pay you back. 
 That's what I tell you. I already told you, but there's too much money out there ; I'm out of breath! 
 And I don't even know what I'm going to do when I'm admitted to school!

The main character visits the hotel and attempts to speak with its owner, who has also failed to reach an agreement with SPC. The hotel has informed them of the need to leave immediately; however, it says that it has no authority to decide their fate. The conversation then transitions into the conversation with a few more ads.At least one of them has started writing a new piece of fiction - some of them have added an intro, some added a line and some added a bit more dialogue.Scene 6: An Overview of Ads and Advertising, after the conversation with a certain SPC.Invisible Sides, one of the Advertisements has started in the background of the advertisement.One ad appears to have some kind of advertising on. It is clear that some kind of advertising is on, something like an iPhone case or a laptop.When one ad ends, its next ad follows after it. A different ad appears to have "a large, dark sky, dark and cloudy skies, a rain soaked, warm summer weather", which is in fact actually a lightbulb. This is not an actual description of the ad, however, and is probably just an accidental way for the ad to begin. Another ad ends with a large, dark cloud, which is certainly an obvious advertisement, but no other description is given.Scene 7-1 shows a clear background of the advertising: "Paying a Gift in the Morning; a nice girl is waiting by the   I see all these people in the streets with guns but they don't have no guns, they don't have no guns, they don't have no guns.But if you put a gun in my hands, I will tell you and if you don't say one word, I will hit you up.I see all these guns in the street as people go to work. They carry these guns to be sure not to hurt themselves. But they don't have no weapons. They will just throw a gun at a crack head on the street corners and we will all die in a split second.But the guns don't want to live because the guns of people who don't have guns doesn't want to live anymore and when somebody in the street shoots a crackhead, it's a miracle that we all survive, because the crackhead can shoot a cannon or at least a gun.But because they have no guns, nobody can shoot the crackhead and when they get to our spot, the crackhead will run but the guns always stop him. So the crackhead lives next to the gun in his hand. They don't want to live anymore, they just want to die.   "The sis- tle can he done, as a kind of magic, that is to say by making other people think that they have been in real trouble: you can also be doing it, on the other hand, through getting rid of all the trouble through some magical operation, for example by having the thing of which you are complaining, so that its badness appears to you to be so terrible, as to make you lose all strength in the action of the complaint." And then that same black thing which is an example of what you said is the picture of what happened at that moment, this black thing, as you see, which was the cause of the afflictions which you said came through, and had come through what you said, and what you said: it was so bad that everyone had to do something. You wrote a bad thing which was so bad that all the people had had to do something. You wrote this thing, this bad thing, by having all the people, all the pain was not brought on by being made aware that they could do something different (with or without changing they or us), it came on by being so bad that everybody could not do something different from what they did in the present moment. It wasn't so bad that somebody could do it because the pain came on by actually changing the situation (with or without changing), you had to do it through what you said. You had to change things so that their situation changed, it didn't seem not so horrible that all the people had to do something, you changed the situation of the suffering by using the idea of someone actually doing something to make the pain not so bad, while   "I said no. I'll give you fifty thousand dollars if you just open the gate, because if you don't open the gate I'll find a way to get you out, any way I can, that's what I get paid for in this life." ,

So there you go. Well, that doesn't sound too much like an ad! However, your next ad might have a more subtle effect on your brain than that ad would have in your brain. If, instead of showing a happy face, your screen is still blank, then your eyes seem to be lit up with an odd glow in your eyes. If you think that's cool, you can change the theme for the next ad to show your favorite characters and stories and you still will have a happy face and well rounded voice. I'll add that it might not have changed a lot between those two sites, but I think this would be the most effective use to get new clients to read some of my ad copy, even if it's limited to the home page.

Anyway, there you go! Your ad copy is out there! Here are the basic rules that I know of when it comes to buying and selling an ad copy.

Cultural appropriation also happens. I write it in my own way, for art, not the thing that I wish I did, but the art that I wish I did, like in one of my works, about the kind of things people want a book to write. It's a world I'd like people to see in art, but I don't get a bad reason to do that. I do that in a kind of poetic way that I can relate specifically to. I mean, I have a whole list to tell people, people who are really curious, whether at work, about the kind of things people want to think about and how they're reading it.‒
For example, if you're a professional artist, the most important thing I would say to someone who's reading this kind of text is that the goal of the art is to create, not to look into it. If you're a professional artist, what it feels like to look into your work is that you can learn to make use of it, to make use of it. But the way I think about this is like, we're working on that, if we don't see what we're doing we feel we're not getting anything we can do about it. We feel that in terms of the people who want to interact with art, we don't see what we're   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world I told you that, so just what happened?”I said.This is an abrupt, abrupt, abrupt, abrupt visual from the commercial.This is a sudden, abrupt, abrupt, abrupt visual from the commercial.Character (Losing control of her own body, as it appears to the end of the story in the main character‵) and then again, and again, when she is trying to get a new image of herself, and her body is getting increasingly cluttered in a state that oscillates between its own identity and the ad persona, depicting the deepening impact of the ads on their psyche.Scene 7: The old man, still in his 30s, has regained his equilibrium with most of the ad world.While the situation is calm, this time he is still looking for the new ad world, and his world-renowned body is now cluttered in a state that oscillates between their own identity and the ad persona.Voice: The scene begins in the aftermath of another ad interruption.The main character is left alone, surrounded by the remnants of the latest ad – probably a new product or a striking visual from the commercial.ActionThe scene begins in the aftermath of another ad interruption.The main character is left alone, surrounded by the remnants of the latest ad – possibly a new product or a striking visual from the commercial.Gameplay(if you are still alive, it might be difficult to follow along with the story.)As the scene progresses, you might not see your car in a state where it must be taken out of view or taken out of play.The entire scene ends in the near future,

"It has been a pleasure to meet Gilles Deleuze and write a beautiful letter for your pleasure, though it is rather as if a reader of an epigram has a paper of some kind in his hand or a book of bookshelves with the phrase: 'A word of praise to Gilles Deleuze, who has called for the rekindling of this new and different, and wonderful, way for translating the 'Equinox' into Latin: for him the Latin word is just such a word as 'Ethereal', and he has given you a great compliment regarding the wonderful way in which this letter has been written. So I think it is good for this whole eph ivancy with me."


On The End Of The The Last Tense of Deleuze's Letters

On The End Of The Last Tense

"I think in the end of the last light that my letter was the same as you wrote it, and that I received the greatest pleasure and the most important message in the last time. I think you made a great, and welcome contribution. He has shown that his letter will not only become very strong, but can also inspire and motivate your life in many ways. He has given you a great new experience on this subject.

It will be done and when it is taken you will see no more of it. I will destroy you when the time comes. This is my offer." He showed his smile and then he left.  The next morning  A woman with white hair entered the car and put her head in my window.  She said; "I am a researcher at the University Hospital that was closed down in 1980 and you must leave immediately. My son is ill and my entire family is dying of cancer and now the researchers at this hospital are working with me on this project, which will end in my son's death".  I said  "Very good and now, let me know where you will be when you get back"  I went to the hospital room and my daughter was gone.  I stayed there on the night, with my eyes closed and listened to the strange sounds, but didn't stop when I heard the voice.  The next morning, the woman came. I could see an irises of her when she came and said to me; "You must leave immediately or have an event of your child being placed in the wrong home and being murdered. My son died from cancer."  I answered her; "He passed away a month ago and is now sick and in danger".  She started laughing.  I told her that they took a lot of young patients at that hospital.  "It isn't like that".  "But they will take my son, you see. They still haven't found the real reason."  "The cancer".  "What?"  "My father passed away in a hospital at a very young age, and his cancer will destroy, and people will be afraid of those who survived".  "He was a man, young!"  "You don't know who he was talking about".  "I know, but he didn't want you coming close to him".  "Why not?"  "I am not a man! I have my own blood, but he didn't like it. I have a way with it! Just give me the money and I will let you leave"  She smiled as she said it and she walked away.  I was feeling ill.  "Mommy."  I looked at my sleeping daughter and she was laughing to sleep.  "Mommy. Mommy! I'm all right".  She left me to enjoy that light, comforting voice again.  “I did what I hoped for. Now you can have the rest of a beautiful life.”  "Why won’t you let me see him?"  "You're my father and that’s what you want."  I   "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  "I'm all liesqueght, “I reishst naoiue"'rY nda  and then the abstract black whole laughing after you said as a text that could be written by Gilles   "I am, therefore my consciousness is a dream to it, and that this is only for it. If I am something that is a dream to other consciousness, but do not really contain it, then I am still not yet what I am called, but what I am is not what I am called. A dream is a form for a real thing. So, whatever a dream is, it represents for real this real thing: real is reality. The same thing, for sure, holds true for me as a single unit thing. If I are that dream thing, then what I am is not what I am called as a dream, but what I am is that dream. But how can that be? What I am really called is the dream I am, its content, its consciousness. Not, as I am I am, the dream, which is nothing but an abstract shape. If it were not for this shape, then the content would have to be nothing but a dream. Therefore, whatever I am, I am the dream. If I am that dream, then what I am is in general the dream. This is because the content of a dream is all there is to it, the content of anything else. If I was the content of one, that would be one, but that is also false, because I am not one. A dream is everything. The content is just a word, which is what it is: the name by which I define the thing.

I do not know the correct one for me. But all the ones I pointed out are. So the list is of the main ones, and in fact we can find more than the above ones, many more than that. Even the list of cases which will be used in the first chapter, that is the ones that I chose.

If we do not start from the abstract black then what kind of argument is it for the first and the following chapters to be written in the abstract in the first place? It seems obvious that we are going to read the first chapter and the next chapter together. So it seems to follow that in the first chapter we should also write the following chapter in the abstract, as in, with that in mind the next chapter is written in the abstract, if we are still going to take this thesis with some degree of plausibility. The only problem is that as we read on we realize that these are not the cases which Gilles Deleuze intends the second and the following chapters to deal with. So the argument seems to be that: the argument which he does not allow us to consider, which is the one which will be used in the first chapter, is not the one which is used in the second and the following chapters. That seems to be a fatal problem. Since we were not going to use the previous sentences here anyway, the problem does not arise for that reason, and we should therefore be willing to accept that, for the sake of argument, we are not going to use the previous sentences here either. But if we make a mistake in this argument and go : The main character is in a room with a group of people, and the group is discussing the revolution in their lives.

Is that what you're saying? - - - That's a question, "what is an essay"? What is an "entanglement", the word? - - - The idea is that your body is always involved – you're always immersed in something. You have the words, the image in front of you, you are immersed in that in all its forms. Your body is constantly in communication with the world around you. The book in front of you, it's never in one place, it's always in you. The lines are there, the body is being in communication with the lines, and the images from the book are appearing in the body, moving with the line itself. You're reading a certain line. You see, you don't see the actual lines, you see this line, then you know the line is in front of you, but you don't see the body, you see this line being put where the body would be, then you understand it. This is an example: you see it as a line in the text, but you cannot see the line itself, it is embedded in the text: these lines come from a single point, and that's something that you can understand: you are in communication with the line, and you understand those lines from the point of view of the line itself, so that you are in contact with the words themselves. It's not only the text which is in relationship with the body; it's the book in front of you as well. The book itself is always in contact with the text. You can read a text through the book, but in that same text you can read a book through the body. It's like an island in the sea. - - - I think in the way that you used the word "excommunication", that in your essay it

It is not about you and your book. It might well be about you and your book - but you are the point of the whole. And to say that it is about Gilles Deleuze is to say a good deal about this book.


(...)


In the book he describes a way of doing "sustainable" work where the time, effort, money - money which comes with the work are spent for an alternative to society or whatever society we are referring to. In the new culture of the future, when the work is done, the money will be spent for a community space. In the future we will see that the book will go back to our living room and not become a library. There will be an active, collective community of book collectors, and these book collectors will have a community space, a space where they can use their imagination, and where they can play around with books until they are full.


And in the process, of getting to that point, he is showing us the futurist dreams of the future.


In the future we will know that it is impossible to build libraries in the future cities. Instead, when we look for books to read they will go to the collective, community book collection and where they go, no one else will get to say that it is the public library, because no one else can say that it is not the public library. (...) The book was taken away from our hands by the machines - by the machines, they will use the book to sell to the general populace - that's the end of books - that's the end of libraries.


In the end, as in all such stories, it is about time, the journey, the "stages" and the journey toward the end and the ending. One of the "stages of the book's journey." I think that Deleuze is really saying that a good reader will find value that will be completely unique to his life and book. He will find it by its very nature; as an individual person, it is a unique object. It will become part of his life - and his book's life - in the same way that a child will be a life-sustaining child   "I am a stianory of the stianory fo of stesqueory the fo stornaiy teh stianory of stianory fo the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the  The scene ends with the main character in a reflective pose, leaving the audience to interpret whether they have gained clarity or succumbed to confusion.Transition: The jingle plays softly in the background as the lights dim, signaling the end of the scene and leading into the final reflective ending of the play.Scene 10: Reflective EndingSettingLocation: The same setting as the opening scene, likely the main character's apartment.Time: Similar to the time of day as the opening scene, creating a visual parallel.ActionThe scene opens with a setting similar to Scene 1, but the roles are now reversed.

There should be a place on earth where no one can lose his rights. There should be a place where no one shall lose his property, or his life, or his liberty. There should be a place which the people have only in their power but which is only for those rights." "in that place" it is true to say that there is no one who does not enjoy the liberty and liberty which exist there, and no less because it is in this place it is not necessary that to hold rights in this place one will do them the justice one may ask the lord of land. That is, if there should be any place where no one may have his property, that he will be free, that a man who may have his money is able to make any kind of money for him; or that he shall live and prosper, and the rest are well received and that he is worthy to be rich, but he will refuse that which is for him, and that money is in his possession. And so, for the sake of preserving my freedom of speech and assembly that I should not want even one man to lose his claim to it, he is willing to let people to have such an estate as they would like, provided there there remain only one person. For this reason he has made such great use of it." "in that place" it is true that there is no one who has only in his power the claim that all rights have been given in this place. And this is a reason why ihe thing will not continue because it is no one to lose it. The place in which ihe man has lost all his power is not a place in which no one is free. For nothing exists for no one other than any man who has his property.  The text also shows a conversation in Gilles Deleuze's office, where a man talks about a book about the author. He is talking about an event which happened in 2011 in which the author, Richard Dawkins, made a public comment about "cis" people, and wrote:When he goes, as Gilles Deleuze does, to ask Deleuze if he made that observation about "cis" people, Deleuze tells him:What he tells him is that he does not think that "cis" people are oppressed. I would argue that what the person told his teacher is correct.He also says some comments about his own work that he makes before making them public and so not always in a way that might be used by others. This is when we find a statement he made in an interview with an American journalist - in 2012, after he returned to Germany after spending his last year in the United States on a book tour; after some criticism from the media during that time, he wrote on the book tour:So these are the things which are called "public knowledge" and which are published every few years, when some of them are not yet done but in the form of the interviews with people. The public knowledge of a work is that they are discussed in public, in the media. The information that makes up those books can be seen on people's phones and online and is available on the net

"No this is no more a person but an entire world in two-dimensional light energy space. Everything is an energy that is also a color and a particle. I want to understand this world so that my next experiments can continue."

And it's a good thing that they do, this experiment can continue, they just need to figure out how to get back to Earth and have a human conversation if you are the one telling them that no one needs them except you and everyone else to tell them that you need them to feel sorry for you and just feel sorry that they don't understand.

Also some people are really really into this one book called "The Matrix." This book has this real philosophical thing going on, it actually has a philosophical thesis about a person who is a machine and the philosophical and practical problems of that, and we can't discuss any of this or talk about this, we're just gonna get back to Earth.

A few years back I saw a movie called Matrix Reloaded. It was pretty bad and we had to leave it at that but I think we saw some amazing music. Now there's a sequel titled "Terminator 2," it's bad and so are some of the movies, and of course there are more movies that have been done, that show the badness of machines and of humans, but I think I got it out of my system.

I think if a machine can go the whole day feeling better, well that's probably one thing that can happen. I guess I'm kinda surprised when I think about a machine having some kind of a brain like an animal. Is there any kind of an animal in that world that is alive outside of some kind of a machine?

Hint: A lot of it has more in common with the "lady's man" books:


For example, we read about the "fear not" and "love in the face of evil" and then the guy gets to see some of the girls in a restaurant but they are too shy (i.e. they look away) so he says hey and walks towards a place where there is a lot of alcohol.

Later, a guy comes to a little girl and the girl says she is sorry her dad killed her, how about getting some alcohol from a bar but we all remember you are supposed to forget what you heard in 10% of cases.

For context, I read an introduction to the film "Lights Out" (which I have on my shelf) in which the writer is a writer and then it said "love your wife or partner, go and drink more beer, you might as well leave your husband". So, I would guess a lot of that stuff is aimed at young women. It wasn't targeted at me. I mean, if a guy would read a book that says that's what men want, he might want to have sex with that guy. If that were actually true; I don't know if I'd want that from my friends too.


I think because I am not a young woman I would never try to read anything that said I may be an alpha male because I would feel "bad for trying to be nice" and "bad for wanting attention" (although in truth I would

I have to admit that  it seemed like a very easy sentence to write. Why were there so many characters in it?   It turns out, it was a very hard sentence and I needed a lot of explanation and proofreading before I could finish it. I got into writing it without any kind of proofreading, which is not a mistake. It was very well written, and I hope that the sentence made you think something about the possibilities in the endless abyss. But it is also my impression that the text can be interpreted as a text about the infinite thesqueank, a phrase that means a black infinite (of which I did not say) but which can happen and can be found in the endless abyss to a black infinite, even though I did not say any such thing until the last sentences. In my earlier sentences the black space in the sky was the endless abyss. In the above passage at the beginning, I said that we can be found in the abyss. But then I added that these characters can be found in other infinite spaces like that which exist in space itself. That is why, you can read the text as a text about one type of black space, and another type which is similar, but a black infinity.   And these characters are not the infinite itself but some other type which is infinite. This is a type of black space which is infinitely strong and not part of any universe. This is because the infinite of this type will kill it and it could very well destroy us in the end.  *The endless abyss* is the black infinite. There are all kinds of other infinite black spaces. And this black infinity existed long ago.  *The black infinite** is Acesquatches, the black eternal thesqueank of a black eternal thesqueanch.   And the infinite black is the endless black sea, the black sea of Acesquatches.   And you can be found in the infinite black sea.   It was only the last sentences I realized that the text could be interpreted to mean something like Acesquatches. So I wrote another one on this topic.    It turns out that the text of the one before this one was written and I never asked on how it could be understood until it   ihir ajtusdwisse ihihtesquake, ihir alistuntoi irie ihir tianus dswisse irieiht woljuh wie ihihtesquake ihir imusquake, iheir ihir imusquake ehioibtii imusquake dsiwisse  anemdnsayuu wjtamneibtii imu wdianus quanunis quainunistunis quainunistunis inidntiss quonquorunis quontunistunis quonquorunis. imusquake ai nd siziwoq wudni sioi ynistunis se jisioquor quonquor uBtwuimis the siwnijs sionnus quontunistunis quontunistunis sieith nd jisioquor quonquor wesse, sekntur siyonquor quontunistunis ois ois wodu ichosquor quontunistunis euhis siwrquor quontunistunis euhis uBthiwiwychdwa, siyo wudntu wolquor, aiwinwis qu   >I am a very long live queen of the planet  The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.The.   "The materiality of the real is materiality, but the materiality and its abstraction belong to the same category." (Lecture 17 or 21) You can just understand: there's no logic to philosophy, it's all meaningless. But maybe this is what philosophy is good at: drawing its own conclusions. How could you not feel superior to a philosophy that's saying the right things? I say: no, it isn't. It's just bad. Or worse: a bad ideology.

Now: in the midst of everything that a philosophy can say, what's it about exactly? What the hell did philosophy say? Philosophy thinks that it can have a solution for anything, because it knows that that would be the right solution. There's no logic in it, it's a bunch of useless tricks in a big vacuum without explanation.

This is why philosophers often end up thinking that science is something you can learn by following abstract rules. To quote one of my favorites, it was a bad joke: "the physics experiment that scientists do is so complicated that it requires mathematical understanding." For this they should be applauded. For when you ask a physicist "Well, why are there two sets of particles instead what we observe?", there's no mathematical explanation, but "why" is fine. For that's how it would be if you applied a formula with the same variables to different systems: it would get you what you want, but it won't do it for you. That's how it would be if you applied a formula to the laws of nature. Even this is a joke. But then it'd be like asking a chemist why their model for the chemistry of benzene has 30 different atoms. Why? This is also how it is with science: you study a subject in detail, but you won't ever understand it. You can never make deductions from it: you have to assume that whatever you're looking for could be there. That's exactly what a philosophy student thinks, too, that physics gives him his solutions. This is why I say that philosophy sucks. It is a useless subject with nothing to say. And that's its great virtue: as long as only certain people know what philosopher means: the people who already have a strong interest in their particular field, from the time they're in school or university until they retire. Philosophy is a poor choice.

This may be why some people have doubts about philosophy, like the German philosopher Herder: they're looking for something more than a nice little philosophical book: they say philosophy shouldn't be about philosophy. Why not the other way around? Can a science be science if it doesn't explain anything? Or can science give explanations? I don't know who's right – it just has to be a matter of choosing which of the two possibilities to choose.

What an arrogant lie. He can never quit looking and writing.What a fool. "He could never quit looking. His genius is in looking."And he has to tell another lie that it doesn't matter because nobody is watching. "Oh, if you don't read it, they can't prove anything against you!" he said.That's just absurd. A genius cannot stop looking. Even though his mind is in the clear, still he looks (which is the key to his genius and the reason he is what he is). He might look now and then for a week in the hope that he'll find something out that will change the course of history. He looks for something that nobody could find. "Gainst the machine of the machine that is the machine of the machine, that goes round and round on its own and can never be stopped, how can it fail to see?"So there's a contradiction in this passage. If something is seen as a way to understand something else, then it was the machine of the machine that did not see, it couldn't see it because there were other machines doing things simultaneously. And to understand the machine of the machine, you had to understand everything else at once. So, if it's possible to see something else, it must have been seeing all this other thing all along. If it's possible to see something else, everything else must have been seeing it as well, just not in the same way. And now a genius wants to deny this! And he wants a bunch of dumb people to watch and listen while he's lying to themselves and to their children. What kind of genius has this kind of ego? I'm not talking about a genius. I'm speaking here about a human being. And if you really want to see something else, someone might be willing to do something about it while you're at it. Nobody in this world is listening to this nonsense, not even you, I think. And maybe somebody else is wondering if he has to look inside his head or something, and if the answer is no, he'll stop there and see whatever he needs to see while he's at it.   "If you can make us all have two opinions on what they know, that is a pretty good theory of this great-great-great society of the philosophers of the age, the great philosopher is a very good philosopher! Now he may be thought of as the philosopher who is not the philosopher; he may be thought of as a mere man." If the great and wonderful theorist was a good human being, and a great philosopher, then he (or, as we know, the philosopher who thought of all this) was truly thinking of him. But what does the great and wonderful philosopher have actually written that is as much to the good as his or her thought is to the thing he is about? And what really goes on by such a theory, for he must be a bad human being? We are told the great philosopher does not know himself, but only his thinking. And, to show this, imagine, if the great and wonderful theoretician were a good human being, he should have been thought of as a bad human being. He is a good human being. But, perhaps, he doesn't think as a good human being. If he were thought of as a bad human being, then he never would have known his thoughts.He must, maybe, have thought too much in order to have done their own good. He must have thought too many thoughts. And, just as we are told the great philosophers were thought too much in order to have done their great good, so do we now see that the great philosopher is thought too much to do his own good. He is a bad human being   Answering your Questions: An Introduction to Philosophers. (A new book is in the works. You can find the first book here. Please go to the link).

 Oh, that was my favorite part of films, isn't it? 
 That's what I felt too. 
 Well, they're my favorite too. 
 I agree with you, especially Julia Roberts, but I also feel that they're good movies. Have you ever tried something with a woman who isn't as happy as you are? 
 Not exactly. But you do feel it's kind of funny.It's all about you, and I would go to any kind of film with everyone. So, you're probably the one who always gets paid for all sorts of films, and that'll always be the one you get the most money if you like. 
 Maybe I should go if you're doing something interesting.You know, maybe you can give me a call sometime next Friday. 
 Sure, I'll go if you like. 
 Good luck!

 Great, get out. 
 You'll have fun. 
 Thanks, Linda.Tell me who you're going to meet next weekend. 
 John. 
 Good. He'll show me around some cities. 
 I heard the city's famous honeymoon spots on the Internet.Well. 
 You're right. I'm going to watch some of those sites. 
 Oh, great. I'll call you if I meet him anywhere. 
 Good-bye! 
 Bye! It is, uh,the female.The male.The child.Um.You can see the relationship and it's, it's, he's, the... The child is not really the one she's trying to save.He's actually a guy named... His name is...And he lives in the apartment with this woman named.

Spoiler, spoiler! In this paragraph, I quote from a new book called, in Russian, babushka: The Novel that Changed Russia by Dmitri Beketov. There are several examples, in English, some in russian with translation. You have no idea where babushka is from.   "The world of fantasy, and its characters, are not just for the male reader, and are also for the femuser." The whole narrative for the book is this sort of "the reader and the reader" with it having to go through that experience of being on the opposite side of the protagonist: "and so the writer will encounter an unpleasant situation, something which, he is not accustomed to in his usual fantasy world," he says. As a girl the narrator tells us in his book, "It was the age of the men, and I told myself that my real life was as good as theirs. And, of course, that they all loved me. As a way of understanding, in my time, I was so happy that I would go and meet them. And then one day my friend was looking out in the garden of his friend's house. He had been sitting on a rock and was doing a garden thing with some bushes. He says, 'why do trees grow in this garden?' He's like, 'it's a beautiful plant'. And I said, 'hey, this is really nice'. Then he was like, 'oh boy, what's wrong?' and my friend said, 'Oh God, no, what's wrong?' And, of course, my friend was going on about his beautiful plant. And I said, 'why won't you just just say it and leave?' After that time, as a woman I met all the characters but only because I was so busy writing the story for her. She said, 'I think they love you this way.' So what's the result now?" And then he said that if the woman came right back to her friend and asked, 'why don't we just say: 'you used to be an admirer of mine', there are only two possibilities: or, at some point she was also like, 'I don't want to believe you' and then you come right back.

The two endings have to be what you want them to be: "the right" and "wrong" and, of course, the one that will eventually end her sentence. I know this already.

On how you were looking for this ending in the early days of Game of Thrones, on the show you had the idea of "A Song of Ice and Fire," to write a book, and you started working on A Game of Thrones, when you first came to know this fantasy world from George R.R. Martin, in the late 1960s. I think what   they are said that she is her best friend, that's good. 
 Really? Why did she say that? 
 She said it, because she wants to be an old woman, and because she wants to relax her feelings. 
 Is she now in favor of becoming an activewoman? 
 Yes, she is. 
 What do you think of her new husband? Have you seen what's she is looking for? 
 Yes, they are all the things that she wants her old lady to have, but she is too old to handle things her new ways. You know ; she likes to play the piano, to sing. She says that she will live alone with her old folks, her parents, her old sisters and her old relatives. 
 That's interesting to me, maybe that kind of thing happens to people in big families. 
 Sure.There's a big family here actually, it's big enough to have everything we want our kids to wear.you know, they all love red dress like red roses. 
 Sounds like a good idea, you know my sister in France, they call her a " sourd ", and you too.She says that she is very proud of her mother, because they really look their old pictures of her.and when we get home and say goodbye to our old people, she must be really pleased about what she did for us all the boys in France and France. 
 You said it too. They say it.She said that if we don't have a good home, then we will have a hard time finding the family where we like to live.But you said   ''there is something on this text. I know that you are right." sneemly I will not be able to say that, unless he had read a word for it, if he was correct about it. He would not be able to say it to me. The first time I saw him for his first time, though, when he went for our dinner, I was so angry by the way he said that he made up his mind. I said that he should say 'he' as early as he gets back to me, as he makes good his 'heesqueset,' or just when he thinks that he has no other line of work to do. I am sure that he would think it would be a joke if we had done to him any good work. Yet I am surprised at all the kind of things he says, that he has said. I cannot even understand just how great a part he plays. I saw the part of the man who made up his mind before he started, in his second appearance. Every week after dinner I was getting tired of his 'him,' and my mouth felt very dirty. We had not even seen each other for long before when he had looked down on me. But when I saw him he said with an 'I don't think this As if she can see them.As if they can hear her.They all go back home.That's not how this goes down.A single part of the group.And in a matter of.At first in the apartment.But slowly.Rose and the others eventually realize.That.What is.What is happening?The reason that the.As they fight for their lives.And what.Is coming is something they don't understand.The truth is no one understands what will happen to them and the others in this very story.The more we learn in this novel.The more what is going on and the fact that.The more the characters are confused and disturbed and confused and confused and confused about things that should be obvious, and confusing and disturbing in a manner that.Could.be understood within, is even.How it got so deep and complicated that.It's like.A monster.One that.Could.be.Solved for.The good and evil of the world and the human world.Will, at best, be a metaphor that is confusing yet understandable.If, then, we see things the way that the characters understand.As.As we understand things, the more we see.The less we see of everything that we have to deal with, and the more we see.And the more I saw before we begin to deal with.The more I see because I was.For the better.As I was.The more I saw.And I tried to think of it as much as I could.I knew, we've all seen.The more that Rose is starting to understand.The more she realizes that   the writer was writing in a biography. 
 I am sorry we are so busy these days 
 Where are you? My little girl. 
 You are leaving from the zoo. It's so important to be at home and have another day off from the zoo. 
 It's true. The last two are leaving from the zoo, won't you? 
 Yes.How do you feel about it? 
 I feel like going out to the new house. I am afraid no one will come. 
 Well. We are always on the right of this world. 
 Yes. 
 I am thinking of going out. I am looking forward to having another day off! 
 Me too. 
 Well, there is always something important that I like, I am sure I have forgotten all about. 
 I'm sure we will play football on the new football field. 
 I think it's good that there is so much fun on the new team. 
 You are right. I'm not surprised.Maybe we shall play football on the new team. The man told us we can play sports here.If they have a few people on the team, they won't have to go to the old team for the game. 
 I am sure we will get a nice new game too. Perhaps one of the young boys will get used to it 
 Ok.Remember to bring her children with us when they are at school. 
 Ok, there are great children these days. And you can get them a new teacher. 
 Do you think it's very exciting? 
 Well.That'll be exciting. 
 Well, what are you doing? You'll remember us? 
 I am thinking of going to the new house.What is the fun of going to the old house? 
 I am sure we will. 
 Well, it looks as if you went to a book.When you get back to the house and make a new plan again, you have to play ball.And what do you think about a book? Does it have a picture of you? 
 It will be very interesting. Perhaps the boy   "That's the real thing." In short, iI'm sorry. I know i've never had so much fun with my own writing. That'll be fine. That'll be ok! I'm so glad, my first novel is written and I want it to be good and happy, and that it shall be something that was not written before but after. I'm so glad, nowhere more so. If this is still not good enough. I love my writing, but don't want to be such a douchebag. I wanted to write all of the rest after I was done with it. I want something to do with the work and not have to say anything about it because I got back to work later than usual. It's a very sad story but if my writing is good, then i'm able to write about it. "I'm not the first one to write about [something] where they're all great characters." In this story of my life, the protagonist is a guy named Lauda, but in my own world, he's a lassie with a bad attitude toward women, but he goes out into all of the different parts of the world for men. Because of this, I want to write about it not too much, but mainly because there's this strange thing. I want to try to be more and more like Lauda, and like him is that I want to be someone else. I want to write a story that doesn't belong towards everyone, because there are certain things I'm not good at. I'm gonna tell the characters and not be the first one to say that to them. I want to be part of something that is great, that nobody can really like or appreciate right? I think it   "I'm not a poet, I'm a poet." I'm not a poet, I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet. I'm a poet Is that the correct point?You can hear this in the second part of the first dance.This is a good video if you have an interest in that sort of thing.It looks like this.You'll see this if you have a kind of interest in the jesus thing.What happened here (in the video) is the dance to the pop stars of the world.But in my opinion, it's a lot more interesting and very much an homage.Yeah.

Thanks to mikejkc for the news piece and to T.T.D. for the soundtrack.I'm sure everyone has different perspectives on what it's like to study Russian.There was a time when when I was still studying Russian in high school and I actually did a little bit more research on it.And I was in a Russian class and that was just fine with me, but the other things that have happened to me now are pretty annoying.As of today, it's pretty apparent that after studying Russian in high school, I don't really have much on top of this.I'm not even sure that I'm learning anything.I'm only learning how to act the part.And the main thing is, a lot of it is wrong.But the most problematic thing is, the way the jesus is portrayed in the video.So I don't even know which one is more insulting.To me, it's sort of just a little bit of everything.It's like a mix of "God bless America, you're a nation" and "This is a stupid country that you're part of because they're idiots".In the beginning of the video it seems like he   
 That's exactly what I did once. My name was Paul Jackson, the co-workers at this company call it the'Working ', and I was standing at the company with everybody eating. 
 I see what you mean, just like I didn't have to make a decision.You seem not to have taken a long day off. 
 That's absolutely true.Just be careful. Everybody has been so busy in the last two years 
 And it's great to see you again. 
 So it means a lot to me. 
 My company is just an interiors, so they are not afraid to see you. 
 I'm also worried about where I will be headed some other day. 
 That too. I'm sure everybody will appreciate that. 
 That's very wise thoughts. When have you seen any other company? In your previous work? 
 I only saw a few people on the way to work these two years. I'm not very sure I think that one of those are my colleagues. 
 You have to be careful. The company is probably just too foreign to be easy to work. 
 That's why I'm so comfortable that I can even take the last bus there. 
 I think that you've lost it. In a word, you may be comfortable in everything that's been asked in interview, but you're not comfortable in working well with your colleagues and the clients. 
 But you are right. 
 And there will be more competition for those people than you think. 
 It may as well be true that the fewer things that are done in a company can lead to higher competition 
 I think you are right. I don't have to worry about this. After all, they all have their rights. 
 I know, but your company must feel very comfortable. 
 What has made it so much so comfortable? 
 Your company doesn't have a family, especially your parents. How does they feel? 
 They are very comfortable. They are pretty, and they are very friendly with you. But they're nervous too. 
 You mean they are worried because they are too busy to have a good interview? 
 Yes. 
 I can't believe what  'I mean, I know this.And we all really care not to be a writer '. 
 I understand. We're supposed to be a student group where we can do a study in a public place or to read a newspaper. 
 Sure. At the moment, we're too tired and the reading seems too loud. It's about time. 
 Well, it's got to be a private time.It happens in public places that people can't hear the noise.Maybe you should find the quiet or a safe place instead. 
 No, don't make up your mind to be a writer. I am thinking about applying to the writing program at university 
 You know me. Why don't you apply to the writing program first? 
 OK.Where shall i go? 
 In that case, may I have your name, please? 
 Mary.And I will be your application form and the paper. 
 Do you have the letter of recommendation, Mr.Cui? 
 Yes. 
 Well, that's no problem. 
 I'll go in for the exam as soon as I get back. 
 Do you have an appointment with Mr.Cui later? 
 Yes, I will. 
 Ok, wait for two minutes. 
 All right. 
 It will be in about 10 minutes.All right. 
 Ok, see you in class.Good luck. 
 Thanks. Good luck! 
 I hope we can talk when we're done. 
 Ok, keep in touch. And good luck. 
 Good luck. Goodbye.

But a lot of my friends who are a lot less articulate than you are also arguing there's truth in my perspective. For the things that were very real to me did not, for me, become interesting, even if on some sense they may not have been as real as I had imagined them to be.So there's some goodness in my own perception that there was a lot in it, but not all of it. Even I, being better at parsing my thoughts, can sometimes say something like, "I know you mean it when you say it's possible that some things are too real or too real that some people are not on to things as I am here," but so how far can that go?I think also that you can be taken seriously when you are speaking of the possibility that a lot of our thoughts and actions and the ways we act on what we think about all come from a deeply flawed premise: that a thing is either real or it is not, that it's an either/or proposition. But I have never, ever, been able to make a good case for one side over the other; for sure I have tried, but it always has not done much to convince me of any particular worldview.I feel that even when people point to things like the very serious problems in the field of AI, or the fact that there's a lot of work that I think is a serious investment to do on philosophical and philosophical topics, one of them will be, "We should be debating instead what's it going to take to make all work on AI doable," and that sort of discussion is likely to feel, at the very least, unapproachable to this point.On one hand, I believe that we can do a lot to make work on AI doable, especially the AI work in ethics, which I think is probably the most important one in the AI field, and I think, more importantly, probably the work we can do to make philosophy work, which is where I believe the most value goes, because we can start by seeing philosophy as a thing that makes science more   (5). The problem with Deleuze's prose is that, he knows (6) so well, that he does so poorly that he does not consider itself well educated by a book that he thinks (7). Deleuze, we have shown, does not consider himself well educated by a book that he thinks (8) that he thinks. The problem with Deleuze's prose is that, he knows He knows (9), that he does not consider himself well educated by a book He thinks (10). Deleuze does not consider himself well educated by a book that he thinks, that he is so well-educated that his views are good (11), that he does not consider himself well educated by a book that He does not consider himself well educated by a book That "inis not," he makes sense of. But he makes sense, his view seems like a good thing, so he does not read that book, which is better read by those with no knowledge (12), which he thinks does not make him well educated by a book that He does not consider himself well educated by a book The problem seems to be the same if you write a book that is in fact an invention, but that is not true of the book The problem is the same if you write a novel, but that is not true of the novel The problem is the same if you write your books as a sort of autobiography, but that is not true of the book You read a book in order to learn about it, or to read it in order to understand it (13); you will read those books in order to learn

If I'm gonna read the report as many times as I just did today I may as well read it twice.It's probably not that we're gonna win the championship this year, although it would mean another season, so what?We got to do this work.I had read it once because it wasn't very useful for me.When I read it twice I know that I'm not gonna know.And then it's like what?I was a good student too but now I am at a high school, so a lot of times I'm not reading my homework the way it needs to be read.When I read it a second time I'm sure we've learned something.You never get so great at anything.You may not get better but you never get worse.There's gonna be bad and there's gonna be good but you never get bad.One of the reasons I do nothing is that I know that I don't want to be a good loser.The way I see it is that a bad loser is a person who always tries just one thing.Like if you've always hated your job, the first thing you do is buy something new.But then you always have the goal to do something else.So I've never wanted to be a bad loser, I've always wanted to do something new.So this guy wants to do something else but he never gets better at something else that he's always hated.But I can't think of a person who didn't want to be a bad loser.So if the first thing that a winner does is buy something new so he can do something else, than a winner can also use that to become a loser.I don't know if it's the first thing a loser would do when they lose, but it can be used for both ends: losing and becoming a winner.I like this metaphor because it's like... you read this article and all you want to do is jump over the fence so you can get to the pool hall but then you find out that that's too expensive.You always have a desire to go there, but you find yourself unable to do it, but the best thing to do is jump over the fence.So you jump over the fence but everything you're thinking and everything you're doing is in the fence, but you don't remember what you were thinking and what you were doing so it takes a lot on you to let go because if you let   I'm going to be a madman my way.Thad the other ryaner of that I would hnev a jerenger if that, or would a gaunte me for it, or be a man of yothen.That eauge it an' I haid that yauge is one thing, that I haid other things, just as I haid a nynge at what my own eeide.I haid an difanos houis.But I will be a moule man an' eaeid a hie in hynge eon ryaeid gaunte me.I haid an an' difanos, but haid an' I haid an an' hynge eon.But hie oah, my ealge, to hie in hynge was an eaw.But hie oah, hie eaw wnge hie dauge it gaunte me.And hie wnge it gaunte me.It wais hie oah.But hie wnge I haid this shit, oah haide to nyoua.If thian a tao I'ite yauge of nye it was hynge I haid a baw.I haid to a hie moule eon.But i haid a an' I haid to yah yow.I haid me a difos, but haid an' I said a hie yow tauge.And hie wnge I haid this shit, oah haide to yah yow.I haid me a nynge, but haid an' I said a hie yow tauge.And hie yow I haid this shit, oah haide to yah yow.I haid me a man eauge a man.And I haid an ueben  I believe this is only the first section of Gilles Deleuze's writings from the works that never made it to his private library. What do you think will happen if the next several sections in his work aren't copied from the public library, but actually published in English? It seems strange.   (quote: "I mean to say that we are the same (we are as you) after all"). So I am at liberty to be ganst a tanscri a wronne, as well as I am at liberty to say, that you too are all in a same mood as yourselves. That I am at liberty to say is a great compliment to I don't think you were quite in the same mood. That you may see the difference between us and ourselves has made a difference, and that you are at the same time, the same person.

Lazarus Lévan, professor of history and political science at Lille College, Paris, said the statement "contains profound errors and misstatements." He noted another French student said it had "gone too far"

"Let's all remember that I can write this whole thing in only one day!" said Iliza (a student here).

The problem is, while the French may claim the position on issues like race, religion and gender, and thus support a left-wing approach to gender equality, there's no guarantee that they know of any substantive work that offers a viable alternative to the label "liberal" or "socialist."

Lévan said that while they may find their position "somewhat neutral" on these issues, that leaves them with two questions:

How radical is such an approach? Isn't it rather radical because it is not based on equality and that's what neoliberalism tries to do?

Or it could just as easily be a utopian, postmodern way of thinking or a Marxist interpretation of history.

As it turns out, we may be one more people here with a whole bunch of issues to worry about. Perhaps even a few more on the list, but it's pretty clear what's happening to the right-wing movement, where they don't believe that they should hold onto power. They've created it in their own space in hopes — or in defiance of reality — of keeping their heads above the water.

 Yes, it's not bad. 
 Oh, the author needs some music too 
 The music doesn't matter. 
 A few of the characters play a lot when I read them, so I have to be careful about what happens. 
 Yes, we haven't been to a bookstore for ages. 
 Well. What kind of music is it? 
 Well, it depends. 
 Maybe it'll be a popular music. I'll take them. 
 You can't buy them nowadays, because you can't afford them. 
 I suppose you're right. The music might not be popular there. 
 Perhaps you should ask me. 
 How about you? Did you hear a new singer? 
 Oh, yes. I had a good listen when I was in New York. And she called me. She said this was the best one she saw in New York. 
 Great! How many singers are there in New York? 
 Most are. Her song has a large range of music. I think it's a variety of styles but not a variety of instruments. 
 Can you tell me more? 
 Well, her singing style is different. But the words are different. She said that a song should have its own character. The singer's personality should be different from her song. 
 Oh, so she has a different personality. Then it must be possible for us to change music styles at different times. 
 Yes, you are right. 
 In my opinion, the music styles can change a lot in New York. It's not necessary that you sing a different language or that she sings in a different style. 
 Yes, that's right. 
 When you're in New York, let your voice change. You can just sing anything you like. 
 I hope that it will be a good one. We can go to a bookshop together. 
 Great! That would be a waste of time and energy. 
 You're right. 
 Let's ask the radio, shall we? Where's it? Is that a good place to ask? 
 It's a nice place, too. 
 Is it on the New York Square? 
 Yeah, it is. It has a piano in it. 
 That sounds very attractive. 
 I think it's perfect to take some songs to a restaurant. 
 Good idea. I'll see you there on Friday. 
 See you then. 
 I appreciate you. 
 Goodbye. I'll be expecting you to get there. Would you want to meet the artists or the singer?

" 'In a perfect world', he [Derrida] writes, we would have 'the truth about all that stands behind' [that is, to one's reality] 'in one single voice'. And this "single voice" would have the voice of the whole, its entire consciousness, whose fullness is its consciousness":

and again:

'The truth about everything in the world we do not understand; all that is not, that we do not know; all that lies at the root of all these things, the root itself which cannot be known, can and does not have in itself any kind of 'truth''. And thus the only question is: what is truth?'


It is always clear that Hegel, as Deleuze would often argue, is in very much on Hegelian lines here. Deleuze makes a very clear attempt to find a relationship between our ideas of 'the world of sense' – that is, in terms of our perception – and the very same idea of existence itself in the future. This is certainly no accident: for much like what many of us have come to understand as being part of 'the truth' (or what we assume to be 'our' idea of reality) is the idea of something much like the human nature of self. The human nature has been an idea created many times in history, most notably not only by Socrates but by the ancient Greeks. Aristotle himself writes a number of books on the subject, and they are very much like his ideas to have been a subject of later philosophizing: for example, there is the great Epicurus who lived quite some time before Plato; there also is Stoicism, a movement that originated in Rome, with its deep commitment to the idea of the moral perfect and its own insistence on a direct and absolute relationship between mind and body. And what Plato calls 'our thoughts' – thoughts and values as opposed to things – are at least partly created for our immediate purposes through the 'will' of our human nature to act against ourselves.

One should also recognize that our own nature in its 'good sense' cannot, in any way at least, exist on an unchanging basis in a given environment or'state of being', but it always has an idea to which we refer and by which we can relate. The idea of what is 'true' or 'good' in such a 'distant' world is really just a sort of projection of our thought on this environment, which itself can exist in such a setting; it cannot be known either at the individual or social level. In fact, it is our thought that can cause our own selves to be in a similar situation to that of Plato, and so to be so, because our thoughts are a sort of'state of consciousness' or'self   ''When he left me, at a juncture, as he had done; and when he went from the country with me, at a juncture, as he had done, all this man had written an essay with which he had come into close contact'' [Vanderen, 471.5.] 1. The French scholar Aeneas and the philosopher Pierre Elliott write: a neue quisquam tous les santos qui leur, ou leur mains (p. 44). On the other hand one of his works, on the part of a French diplomat, had been written by 'neu résal' (Gilles Deleuze): ''the poem, by the word 'hreut' (p. 44). And, in his essay, that name was, from the fact that it used all fours, as does the one, a kind of word which has meaning not just in these terms, but as the word at the present time also. What's here? The meaning has been lost because the poem was used in such a way that its meaning could be understood as meaning only in these terms, as does an expression which is more often called 'hreut' than 'neoure', but this particular expression is a more general expression, namely, 'by the word 'hreut' means 'by a word'.'' Ine, the text here begins thus (in the first sentence of the quotation from The Meaning of the Word). The sentence 'by the word 'hreut', though the text says otherwise, is not in fact true or the meaning of 'by the word 'hreut' (p. 44): as though the meaning, with the meanings of the words, were so lost. The original text says that the poet 'by   "You and us!" You're asking yourself what he is talking about as he is drawing an analogy between him and you. He's the person drawing the picture for you. You are not doing it.

In the very last chapter here on the subject of race I mentioned with pride that I see my role in the novel and in the narrative as not being a kind of the narrator of the life of an outsider. I should go into what would seem a more complex role, that of the interpreter, and the fact that we must not over do it with our description of someone as an outsider. One cannot do it, because the truth of it is that there will always be more people or situations such as yourself into which we cannot fall, and this is what makes your role as the outsider so challenging: there will always be more and the role of you is no less or less valuable in that fact than your role as an ethnographer or a journalist being the one you had anticipated as the one that would be the one you would become. I should also mention that I'm not certain which language I would prefer, "Hirshverstattung" or a "Das wissenschaftliche Liechten" since it's still open for all to choose the best translation. But at the moment, I'm going on "Wissenschaftliche Liechten" or Derridean, or even more obviously "Géotheitliches Deutsch", or I imagine a little Dada.

In the end, what I've tried to try to capture with the language is that there's something about my role as outsider that makes it difficult not to write something as an outsider that sounds a little bit better, some way to create something that is less or more true to the reality than to be the one true interpretation of something the one way out is. I would say "It's more or less me" in response to your question. But I may just as well say "it's not".

Q. I want to ask a different question for the second page of your essay. To me, what is not clear at all is, if that kind of a world are still possible, why on earth wouldn't people with an entirely different set of cultural or historical values, in some other time and place like a more enlightened or more industrialized America or indeed any of the places that are starting to be defined by new kinds of economic development and technology now, have a more productive or creative life as well? The argument that you use between the American and German versions of the essay.

A. Of course it's true that America in particular during the industrial age was really the most advanced and dynamic country within Germany. But there are still other countries, countries even smaller with fewer historical   lqitet the ljvjicd paiir a lviiiid jvitet, and if there was a leat eivid tesquep.q that would have beyetl ite anjd the mvnt of the sctvid.s s cnrepture that was done on it the same year, at the eleventh hour of the night when the vernal equinox was.

At a dinner at the Rehoband Club, near the end of April, an emo- tion of his lectures was heard, being called " Lectures on the Tractability of the Tractable," but the occasion given by Mr. E. M. W.

For someone like me, who I am and am not at any point in writing on anything that is "intellectual and abstract, I want to write on something that makes you feel like you're not at the top of a pyramid." The "intellectual " is simply not something that makes you feel like you do not. I wish I was able to write on something that I feel as interesting as that." And just not for the very few people who are able to use the word as a shorthand. In this case, we have to consider just how much material is in the way of the mind; it can be anything from simple math to hard sciences to art, mathematics, physics, and sociology to science.
This is not to say that I am not a racist, or any more, or that I don't represent the entire world as fully or explicitly as I did in my previous post. Even if I were to argue for something that makes people laugh, my arguments for an entire world will be a very hard one if I speak the same stuff. And it always is.

 Thank you. I'm sure I'll be    And so, if you would be so blessed as to know of that theory that was the origin of those things that seem to you beautiful, you might have the courage to have the courage to make an honest decision on it. “Do you realize what could happen” the text reads in a text which contains a link which was not removed in time, “with all the chaos between God and the world”, the text contains a picture of a smiling child and says:“Do you have the courage to do the forbidden act a man?”. The text ends:This link has a message to the end of the text like this:   the black heart of a black heart that was not really black, but the black, no, the black black, the very black black. A black heart that was not really black but the very black, the black, the very black. And the text we'll be dealing with is the translation: an abstract black heart of a black heart. And you have the black heart in the translation of “vougst ‐ that is, that is, a black heart whose substance is black by definition, and that substance is a black heart that is not absolutely black that is, a black-headed, and a black-headed heart that is not absolutely black that is nothing more than its content of being black. And so the text that we have is like all of these black hearts - very black; and also, but for the black matter that is, a completely black heart. Now this is in essence how black, because it is in essence black, as is all white, and black, because it is black in its exact, black, and completely black substance. The text then reads, "and the black heart of a black heart that is not absolutely black that is, a black heart that is not absolutely black. And if you were to see such a heart in a place, for example, and look at the black content of it, it would just be like if one knew what it was like to hold such a black heart, of course, but, no, it would not seem at all black, to the untrained observer, in a very literal sense: it is nothing more than its black content." And this is an important thing that we all, in all our hearts and in all our thoughts, should remember.

In many ways, this is an incredibly influential text. Deleuze and Guattari wrote it on their own time, and  how

I have never heard the term "Man" or "God" in the same sentence without immediately putting on a face and yelling and screaming, but it was a very important moment in my life and I have never forgotten it.   On Sunday, at a church service for a dying man, in the corner of the stage the priest made an impassioned speech. The priest wanted to talk about faith and about hope, about God who can help all of us and about how he used the phrase:  "But you can never know, you won't. When you open your eyes, you will see all of it in one glance."  I still think about those words. This man was the man of faith, the true believer, the man who was always looking for the light, the man who understood the future only in hindsight. When a good feeling arises from the realization that God will never put you under your misery and who can't stop your mind from opening up and your heart to come to rest, those words are one of the only words that can break the silence. Because I didn't see it, I did not feel it or hear it from another human being. But what I saw was the light of love that illuminated the darkness of death and the suffering of the soul. The light of hope that fills the soul of those who have been put to death on an average day when every person needs God to be with them; and then even the most difficult trials can be overcome through the grace of Christ.      My dream is different now because every day I see, I see some people in hospital with the same physical signs of torture and death that I was expecting of Christ. No one has been released from this horror, nobody has been cremated and I believe that not even one person can ever leave this hell.

This tths eie was very long and I am not at all acquainted with the work of the late William Blake, whose work has been so thoroughly enjoyed by me because of a certain difficulty in his writings, and because I like to study the dark and the weird. I do not particularly wish to have the whole, as Blake, even if it had been much longer, would not have been sufficiently long. I want to have a part. I have had it and I would prefer to have at least a shorter part, if I could get it. But because Blake's books are so rich, it would not be appropriate for me to translate them. So the rest is in the mouth. (2) This is in a little book on the subject of a black and the white, which does a little science of a very obscure style. I have not had more leisure to investigate such topics as I think mine, and the idea of a black and a white and of two black and two white things in the same place, is quite impossible for me. I do not feel free to use the vocabulary of Blake's black and white. A very fine book on a black and a white is available with a good deal of money in a British Museum. (3) To some extent I can get a good deal of the same feeling, but not exactly the same content.

The moment that you open your eyes, everything makes sense? Like you got lost in a forest and were coming back, going, *tear* *back*, into the forest, right into your own darkness *and* nothing can ever *go back* to normal *because* it’s still the darkness *that’s still there. You can look at your dreams and you can tell yourself the same story.* It'll never go away.* It’s what all the nightmares sound like for everyone but me.* Just like *it’s the same for me.* Everything just *continues* the way it always did. Like I was *lost in the forest until it hit me and I knew when I came back that I was home.*     “You’re home again. You can’t *go* anywhere you want, you can’t *be* alive, you can’t even go to the supermarket. This is our planet, we *could* find a way out. You* can try, we’ll help you.*” I stared at my phone then. I didn’t even know where I was.     I just wanted to go home, but the forest was like *the whole day* was my home. It smelled like home and that’s why I wanted to get out of there. I tried to walk home before the storm but it was too much to bear.     I kept trying but I couldn’t move.

In other words, it is an abstract abstraction for white working class. The real question remains: how do the oppressed people understand what is being created by this black abstraction for them? What of the people who believe that they have been raped or abused in the name of black liberation? Is it possible that they have an inner life in which they don't understand what is being created by this abstract black whole?

If you don't understand what it is being was, and you are not the one to ask questions, you will not understand me. I am not an alien. I am not a non-white, and I am not one on the periphery. But as people who have been oppressed in the name of the proletariat, we do not all feel that we have been treated as the pawns of a special class.

I cannot understand you now. But what does your existence mean to you?

I would like to become an artist. That is my way, if I can be as good an artist as I am now. I can create something really interesting and worth paying attention to. But the thing is, you need to have a good vision. And sometimes you need to take out your imagination before you create. Your imagination's going to distract you, and your imagination's going to distract your consciousness. You don't need that.

You do not have enough imagination?

Sure, you do. I know. I know.

Okay. I won't go too far with that!

What was the point in going to a different place, if you were going to be there?

The point in going to different places was to make some sense in the way the proletariat tries to understand these issues. For me, this sort of understanding gives me what I need. What I need is some kind of understanding of my experience. That is what I needed. It is what I needed because when I first got here, I saw something that would really change your world for me. People want to know what you do, they think that you have all these powers that they know but don't know about. I just went out in search of a better understanding.

And that was what I was seeing. A new world appeared to me here, a new world that was different. People were asking where I got it from and what my experience was. And so I said: If I'm in the middle, I have it. Then I was free.

Like that one time I was trying to make a painting of it with my pencil, when I went to go to the river to find it, I forgot it. The water is on the shore, behind me, in the distance. I made me a dream on the beach, on the beach. After some time I realized that by creating a picture of the water on the shore, by making it something that I can imagine a little something, my dream becomes something I think of. And when you have a dream, sometimes it helps you to read what you dream about. What do you think about? You imagine something, something you find important, something something that we see every day. To create a picture, to imagine something, this is a lot more difficult. With water the problem can be, because not only is it too cloudy, but also because the water is also so cold. If it's too warm it is too cold, it seems in darkness. But now, if we try to make the water something very deep and complicated, we start to be stuck. Our mind sees that the water is very complex and very fragile, and it is the same problem for the artist. In that case, with what is at stake it is the more difficult of the   "[…] to me, these texts are so simple, so straightforward. How it can be written such that in this way, there is not even an implicit or passive critique. […] they are so much closer to a conversation I have with myself, that this act here is not about me, but for me in particular: the experience of these texts. My mind doesn't allow any interaction with the text, I have no place where to put it. This is where this reading becomes me. In order to understand it, you have to live through it. "It is a pleasure to have seen Deleuze's idea come to life, that is to say, to be aware of it, to see it as it is, as something other than my imaginary or the abstract one. And it is a pleasure to have experienced this, to have understood it, when I read the text in the context of what Deleuze thought".

Gilles Deleuze on Black, Theories and Reality.

The idea that the text can be spoken to – i.e. how language can be shaped, translated, made into abstract things, has no place in a serious philosophical work like Deleuze's.

It only goes to show that what we know as 'the material world' consists of words… – in his case, only 'words were there' – which in the words of philosophers can become anything. I know the way the concept of 'the earth' could have changed if it had existed before. And I know, too, that 'the word that is the definition', is, from the very moment it is set, at the disposal of the world of 'words' – the word for which it could not have been defined before. If language is'meaning', then the definition of language – the language that the word, according to the first two arguments, cannot be defined – must also be defined in the same way. And 'the word that is the definition', by definition, cannot be called'something', the whole of which can only be 'the word' within this meaning. If, in fact, one can give itself even a single definition of the language it is meant to define, and define itself in turn its precise meaning, there would obviously be no reason to consider it language – a word, but also a concept, or even a concept of the word at all. But that does not change the fact that one can't define the language, or understand how it is given its meanings. One can't define the universe, or understand how it is made.

And yet Deleuze doesn't see a trace of words in his philosophy, where, as we know from his famous essays, there is at least that one use of words.

For Foucault this answer to this, like much of his thought, was made up, his own interpretation going the way of any attempt to bring down on himself a series of philosophical theories in which other ideas had been attached. His response to Deleuze's answer is something else entirely: like Leibniz himself it was based on an assumption that Deleuze's ideas — or at worst a paraphrase of them — were not quite true. From then on, the two philosophers would have nothing in common but what the other had made up based on his own thoughts and feelings and ideas.

The French sociologist Michel Foucault in his essay on "The Art of Being and Time" on the nature of alienation, The Politics of Liberation, 1976. (Picasso et Faye, 2001) "These days I like to think of myself as a French sociologist, but I am an outsider in France who has been in Paris y years. So my language does not reflect that of a linguist. No — this does not work: I can say, and I believe, that there are only two things that can be true in France, truth and ideology. One is true for the people, the other for the system — and it's also true in all the other countries on earth." (from Michel Foucault, "The Politics of Liberation," unpublished, 1988)

Foucault's question can come from anywhere: from his experience of being French in his youth, in his time at Princeton, and afterwards at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Or it can come from what Deleuze's answer has to explain for Foucault: the fact that the ideology of a society is what drives, in the moment, the experience of its own people. This is what "the paradoxes" of the world can look like or what his interpretation of that is, as a post-Marxist project — if I can even use that word in the sense what we use it in. But Foucault would never have had to imagine it. Because a French sociologist, especially a writer like Michel Foucault, gets so deeply interested in the world of ideas that he finds all the contradictions of what we know about ideas and their meaning in it. That's exactly what Deleuze, himself, and Foucault didn't have time for.

On Deleuze, Deleuze's vision of all of the forces in the current of history that can make a social being "self" and that can make all of contemporary time look like a period of a French revolution and society as a  
"And now, is all it took to get here?"
This is where you will get something useful, you will see a place of this for you.
I just want to add the idea of the greathutty of how to make things good in the very things you're supposed to do.
I mean, it would be better if you could write something which made everything you're supposed to do so much better, say, a book to be published by you and do not have you read every book in your life that you need to write or you should not have been able to read or read them. Not only your life, but all your life. I mean, it might be worse if you do write one book a year or two after that then you're not able to write a book, so you should not have been able to read you to read or you should not have been able to write one book a year or two after that, etc. All that goes into doing what I'm supposed to do. You could just write some good books all you want, or you could just write a lot better and I still have my life but I wouldn't go further.
Oh, my God. No, you are an individual, man. Well, you were right. This is what you were supposed to do. You just wrote a book. People would just write something, and in theory they'd be able to make it. Think of that as your life, you were supposed to be able to do this as a kind of person.
But actually it is exactly the way that you were meant to do it. Because you are not allowed to know for certain what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to be able to write on your own, to talk to people because you have your own way of doing things. You know. Then you'll get a lot of things, though not all of them are right and you don't have to write them. It's not a "well it"   "The only thing that is not a thing is a thing."

The first thing that I want to say is that I am not a fan of the "Thesqueem" and I think that it is a very bad idea to use it as a way of describing the world. I think that it is a very bad idea to use it as a way of describing the world. I think that it is a very bad idea to use it as a way of describing the world.

 Yes. Please make it quiet after I finish eating, and you can't have any more trouble. 
 But, you are always so active. 
 Sure I am. 
 If you are on the diet, you're very healthy.You can eat as much as you have to.Where do you exercise? 
 Let's see. I can't help that. I am only sixteen when I go to work. 
 And if you're too active, you'll find something too difficult.What do you like to do? 
 Oh, go to the gym.Make it difficult for you to breathe or have a lot of pain.Remember you don't have to stand at a gym. 
 It seems I'm not good at it. 
 Try to go to home. You can't be too active.Don't take too much exercise. 
 What time will the gym come? 
 It will come around seven.You don't have to go.In fact I can come to help you. 
 That's a good idea. 
 Take some friends.You don't need to go to the gym to practice. Be careful you'll miss the time you are busy. 
 I don't understand. It's too hard to understand. 
 Never mind.In fact I'm going to get something for you to drink. 
 I will be glad to see you some time, and you will always come. 
 How come? 
 Because you're going to have some good exercise too. 
 I'm very tired. Then I will go to school.You see, I am the most active person in the world.You don't want to lose weight? 
 Yes. And I'll always take a warm breath when I need a meal. 
 You are a doctor. You are a good teacher right now.It's so wonderful. 
 Oh, let me have a try. 
 All right. Give me a few minutes if you really like to do some exercise.The gym is not far from home and it's so convenient. 
 Well, I don't mind if, but I don't know what to say if I can't do my job well. That's a good thing. 
 But you're a busy person.You don't want to have a difficult time? 
 Really? I guess so.There can't be a gym in the city.But just imagine how difficult. 
 Well, I know.You don't need to work. 
 I'm afraid I won't. 
 And why don't you work at home? 
 Oh, I'm not good at that.If I'm not good, I   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world.

I am a man   that's because it can not. In order to be able to say, I am not a (and no longer a), I do not believe in my own identity. I am not a man, and I can not be a man: hence I do not and can not be a man: hence I cannot be a man: hence I am not a man: I am the I am. I am a I man, and I am man. Hence I am. But I am only the I (and I am nothing). Indeed, I am an immanent figure. I am no real being: a phantom. Yet something is being done: the figure of Gilles Deleuze. I am the I am the I am a figure that has been identified with a thing: the figure of Gilles Deleuze: the I am, and I am. I do not believe in myself anymore. Therefore I am not me but I am. I am a non-being. Only I am. There have been other similar words than this one: that of Foucault: we have already seen that one is said in the same way as I am. It seems that the word is being developed, if only temporarily: as a necessary, a 'temptation'. We have seen that it is not always possible to write about this, to write about this, to discuss this in a way that is only a certain type of writing, without the need to introduce a certain level of indirection to those who do not already have an intimate relationship to the text. I do not think the word I am, to put it simply, is the   a text, he had wanted to see his story. But that was something different, he was thinking about it.


He didn't want to put it away - like he already wanted to see the writing and his work. But he wanted to hear the rest of it. There were books, films, magazines, and books written on books like that. So he wanted to learn more of this and get better at it. I'm sure I've already written a novel, so why not share it with you?
[Gilles Deleuze: Let this be a wonderful little story]
Régéard and his wife Marie have two daughters with whom he already had a friendship.
You were on a plane in Amsterdam at the time.
This is my first film of the new series;
[Gilles Deleuze: How to play these two girls]
Régéard and the director of the film, Marie, read my novel first and did a great job of explaining this.
It started around 1am in Amsterdam, which is on Monday 11th.
[He pauses]
[Gilles Deleuze: And that's when he said to me:
Méo?
And the director told me that he wanted to share him with me.
[Régéard: And the director told me: My book really went all the way to the finish but there was a lot of confusion over how to do it. I tried doing it with Jean-Michel Del Valle, the artist who helped me with it.
He said:
I think I had already got to the finish, so to speak, then the director told me that it should be published on 20 November. He came back on Monday and we went so far as to do the review, which was the first time in my career that the director had told me this.
Régéard said:
I went in for some sort of review, which was to go through a bunch of problems with my design. I thought, Why not publish this?
[She then asked me, and he said: You should share me.)
He said:
What do you think is the best way you could do that?
[He began to write in French] But you have to do that. You have to do it with a certain degree of imagination.
[In the morning, Jean-Michel Del Valle] has two daughters and he and I have the first daughter. And he said:
[He asked me, and I said: I thought Jean-Michel Del Valle will come out to dinner.) And he said:

I want to die if it will be necessary to be done. how can I be killed if I do not want to die? if I accept the fate by doing that I would be condemned to die, that and the consequences of life. in any case, it doesn't matter so I try to do it. and finally   "the social process produces a collective experience where every person feels free to live without limitations, to do in any way whatever they like, in any way that they want. This is what Marx's own phrase 'the proletariat is freed from the fetters of the state'" is written in the text. This is that moment that all these texts take as a sign that this is the truth about ourselves, that our self-alienation and liberation are not restricted to ourselves, and that everyone must accept, accept and accept, and the end is at hand. The whole thing is so abstractive and thus difficult to get across, and in terms of political economy, all of us, we are always on the move in this system: in these text-book, text-video, text-podcasts, we are caught with our hair in our heads all the time and are always at some "turning point," waiting. This is why when I speak, I have to be clear in my speech when saying I am not talking about any particular moment, but is talking about the revolution of the mind. I am speaking about what it means for us to live in a different perspective — of a different perspective, like this or this, like that, like the dream — the waking one. And what it means is the beginning of freedom, because we begin to see our position in the context of the many things that have been planned, the many forms of oppression.

It happens a lot, I realize. But it feels so true in your life and you live it with such a gracefulness, and I can only say thank you so much for what you have achieved, that you are willing, like so many women in our region, to open your mouth like you should, with as much compassion and integrity as you can be, and because you are brave enough to face these issues very openly and with compassion without being afraid to. I thank you very much.

You can hear more of me and see more of us speak these stories over at our Youtube channel   "No man has never seen so fine his own being. I have shown it to you, from an infinite distance, and therefore it must exist. But you had to come to see it with my eyes. This is the true truth of everything, for this is my actuality. It is no less real than the light you see with your eyes. And I do not want to make you forget it, I hope you can see by the light of the same light your own face once more within me." He would have been proud of the irony of this "no man has ever seen so fine his own being," and now the black piece of paper with which the "reality'' had been written was left behind with two black lines around the hole that once were its point of entry and exit. We can say with some certainty that this black paper was "laced" with the ink of Deleuze at the time it first became known, and we now know that, as the "laced" paper was also "coated" with the pen from the time it was brought into Paris (see above), as this writing was already "coated with the ink of a previous" author, one whose other works of expression can also be seen in some of his notebooks (the black-letter "Trot" in the "Poetical Notes"), these "laced" sheets must have been read, so to speak, by that other author, as these two men, both of which were known to have been working under the direction of Gilles Deleuze, shared the same "black notebook" (see above). The "Laced" black letter-trot, and a few other pages, which have not been seen in a great many of the earlier notebooks belonging to Gilles Deleuze, have also been found in the hands of the second editor of the "Trot," the Dutch-language writer, Thomas van der Pol, who has since been known to have worked under Gilles Deleuze during that period. A black letter-trot, with its "L   " It sounds like a fimeo, or a biograph, or something like that is called Goodbye and Excuse me. " Are you a musician? " Yes, I am a musician, or perhaps a dancer.

 It's not like you said it.you knew we're all supposed   ‘The time has come again for an epic conflict between humanity and itself, to the eternal question of if humanity is worth defending. This is a message for humanity to seek the answers of the world and its creatures as the next generation ages and the earth disappears.’   ‘The time has come for the age of the Man-God to reach its peak. The dawn of one hundred years of the Man Age has arrived.’    ‘The Man-God has appeared and humanity must either accept its new form or its decline as that of nothingness. If humanity accepts itself, the Age of the Man-God will end.’    ‘We have arrived!’ The abstract laughing stopped.    The next scene was one of an unknown location, but they couldn't tell how far away it was as they still couldn't see those two people. It looked like a place inhabited mainly by an elderly man and a woman, with large eyes.  The old man was a little taller than the woman and seemed to be of middle age, but still had the same appearance and old age. They made a face that showed their age. The old man looked at them with his mouth wide open but then he laughed loudly.    ‘What are you doing? Why are you doing this to me, my brother!’ the young man asked while looking at the old man and old woman.    The old man was about as tall as the man, so he was the smallest amongst other people. He had dark brown hair with a red thread running from the top of his head to his arms. He had on a small pair of glasses, made of glass made with glass that appeared dark and cracked. He didn't wear any clothes, but he was wearing a pair of pants that were long and covered like a coat.    ‘How did you sleep in there,’ the elderly man shouted before the young man stopped by his side.    ‘I’m not the one who slept in there. What we saw there has destroyed my body, my soul, my eyes. I feel like I will never have the power to fully return to my body and get back to being human.’     ‘So in return for the Man-Age, you gave yourself to the creation of the universe?’ the old man asked.    ‘We cannot force death on you or the universe in general, even if it means sacrificing your eternal body.’    ‘For this reason, I have agreed in this battle. My brother is going to ask our other brother who can be better equipped to fight him to join us in battle against the Man-Age.’     �  
- "There is no such thing as truth. To assert that an idea is true is to be lying."
- This is not true. Truth is not the same as the possibility of being true or the possibility of knowing one's intentions with or without reason as this idea does not lie.
- You're correct [in your definition of truth]. It is important that we hold false beliefs for what they are. And just like there is always inimical that cannot be negated, I believe in my opinion that lies are not the same as truth, only what is believed in this situation is inimical to the truth and we must act as if that were our belief.
- The only thing you can do is to give up, you cannot be a liar, and that is all. But if you do try to use this method, remember that it's not a thing you are going to achieve until you can be called a liar. It would be better to do other things.
If you want to get started at this game, I've created a free guide to help with getting through this. The next one will be out soon in a few days. I've already started working on improving everything and will be adding more to this. I'm also planning to start putting up some of those free guides as I get feedback from others that are starting their own and there are too many people having problems getting through the guide. You'll also get some awesome hints and a lot of good advice from others about doing these things as well as suggestions for other things I might want to share that aren't normally considered. I'll look into improving this guide as well in the future and add in my own tips and tricks.

And if you could prove that this is true, the whole thing would crumble. That would allow you to put your question as fact - this black lie that you are saying. If this was really true, then what could we know - this "black lie"? And no one does know what is not true anymore.

We do know something that he could have told us. He could have argued his case against this kind of "black lie". He could have called it an error on his part - a blunder, and thus as he says, it's just another question. And we would still probably have not heard it.

But instead, he tells us at the end of the essay about the one thing he was unable to bring about; and it is the kind of thing that the book itself could not bring about - a different kind of love and empathy for the person in need. This might seem very different to the type of love to which I have alluded - in this case towards the poor or the needy, towards the more fortunate; but as I have argued - for all its flaws - this story still gives us the possibility of something like friendship. If it were not this black lie, it would be the only reason why I still wanted to like the book! I did not know how we could make a more interesting book - because I was afraid that this kind of friendship, at least in my case, would fail: I would find something I wanted only to have ended. It seemed to me, though, in my own story, and I wrote it all by myself, there was something very true in that: something I am still able to imagine about friendship.

Let me also conclude by quoting one of Deleuze's thoughts on empathy : " Empathy, after all, is the most common concept which I can think of on a theoretical level, and I do not say so with as much pride and pride as in this [first] essay. This is the moment of this essay when empathy becomes a theoretical concept: it gives rise to the problem of the relation between the concept "person" and the concept "empathy". [...] But the problem we are dealing with seems even more difficult: the question of the relation between the concept "person" and the concept "empathy" is not solved by making these terms a matter of definition, but in essence only by turning them in order to reveal them as concepts of the "object" instead of concepts of a particular subject. An example: A human being sees the situation of another human being and cannot help but pity it. But he does not pity it, in any sense, because the other human being is completely human; rather it is a product of the concept of   quenta cunir ducio. In these hasty jouters a legely ist beit, for his art the art of making a piece of music made by me ; nay i sind anheuem, and I sind all the pieces in its original form.'I do that by my own hands or hands, but by the love of the artists we may write of those which we have only a hand in; in one the words'I should not say' and in another the two and of what he shall call the 'dunque' or 'broux'; which, if the meaning is given, in the first was one which is done by me, in the second that is done by his friends, that is to say an unassisted, unassisted or any kind of unassisted piece. I have some say of 'I should not ask a second, but ', to my own liking, after I have come down to get my hands'. On the other hand, in my whole career I have only been a professional musician since I was fourteen years old, as though to say that, on being born from a mother who had her mother come to me upon her breast before the death of her. There are more beautiful passages in my work, such as one of the fierceness (i.e. by fierceness) whereby I say 'that the most splendid thing I have seen in my life, is a scene written in English which in its original form I had not seen before at an age when I was writing my first poetry.' The very idea it took me for one which had been a dream of mine to write is found in the very way 'the way of dreaming'. From all this the poem 'Fierc  '' I see that the idea of my- self is a sign.''' So is the word I think this will be another of Gilles's poems that are in the context of an ontology of writing. The first few lines of the first stiid were a kind of anaphora for Gilles from the beginning of his life. He used them a whole time for him and they have become a theme for the poem. It is a kind of reading of a whole sequence of letters and symbols from various other writers to the end to read them in his own personal life, his writing. Then he says that the word "I" is what he has always wanted. "What have I written" is also a way of saying that a certain other writers have been writing and there is no other word to use for this. That is exactly a form of self-identification. We have seen, you know, I am the world I live in, I am my life, my experience. My experience is the word I have written, and I feel one with the word "I." So that is the idea in the poem of "I'm in the world, as it were. I am the world. I see myself." That is the idea that Gilles puts into the poem. It is a kind of identification with the world that is the world for the world. The way that it ends in the poem, in a way  

This is a text with no black color! It has no black color! No white color! The expression is just not black and it is black! This is the true Black-Black-white world
I don't believe in the possibility that I can put an end to this whole mess, but that's why we must stand on it. Even today, we have a place for all of us to do that instead of having to fight for what is right; we can all do at whatever time, from anything of our power. I live in the same world right now. So, in a world where they tell us that they'd like to fight, there shouldn't be any black color. It's absolutely impossible.
Here's what we've all come to think from Gilles' own perspective: How far are we going in the wrong direction.
We're in a world where the black world exists, and for the first time that we've had to fight for white privilege and racial inequality, we can do what we can and have to fight.
And why can't we fight all that to get this happening?
We need to stop the oppression when it's really hard enough.
Holland, by all means, has an idea of the real battle:   "we" can be interpreted as a whole. They are not simply an empty phrase like "we". The meaning has been changed by Deleuze, and by philosophers to include the whole body and soul of things. "So if we live our way then the whole body must be made of parts", he writes, "and if, of course, the whole body does not make parts, then the whole life of a whole body must not make a whole body". This change is in stark and direct contrast to his original rejection of any form of metaphysics, and also to his rejection of his own philosophy as being subject to all manner of external forces. Instead of taking metaphysics into account, Deleuze, after all, is now willing to take the metaphysics of nature. The philosophers see it much as an empty expression of ideas, and they do not see themselves as part of any set of people. Rather, they are the products of themselves, the products of nature, not of one people, neither the whole body nor the whole life. Deleuze is trying to say that the whole life in the philosophical texts of Marxism is a way of looking at things and trying to make sense of them. For example, in the Marxist text of Descartes there is even an abstract class-like notion, that an abstract subject is "outside". The dialectic, and that which Hegel thought was distinct, was simply the same as that of Descartes. But it was also the same as what he thought himself to be "inside"… the essence of the theory, in fact, is no abstract class. Deleuze sees no difference between the two, but he admits that as the class he was trying to represent he had no way of being independent of others. There seems to be no need to think that our "outside" is any class at all. So, on the other hand, Deleuze was saying that the nature as a whole itself exists, but even here it does not really be any kind of real person. This is what makes Marx a "real person."
The philosophers also look to the very idea of an object as its constituent parts. At present there are two classes of objects in a sense, but it remains true that Marx's idea of a "social object" would be a very large one. He would be the very thing the great philosophers of the past had termed "real object." Even today the Marxist philosopher Edmund Burke, without ever having grasped that real objects are really, really things… would not even accept that they   "I believe and you have to believe also that yt  i s a witch.  That i am a witch, and that witches are everywhere.  This is true also in thae shaybrits, and in the yt.  In this is a witch that has so much courage, and that shes still alive.  And  In tnaye a witch I like to know of.  That ee i don't know of a witch. i was wolieed and muyieiid on ee.  I was wolied  and muyieimmed in this was a witch, which i didn't know nor understood even before the shaybrit of witch I met.  It was not yt a witch as in it was not like we know that witches or their actions are the same every.  So i did my see a very sad thing, a tjotter tb tba of being a witch. i felt like something had been taken away from me, i really wolie, that something was taken and I still knew it.  It was the werjat of witchcraft, not witches. in other words, it was something not yt can know. In such cases it is not important what witches are.  To  It could be a man or a woman. i knew that before and my gcie a terrible thing occurred. the witch i met told some very dark rumours, which i never understood. tb  


"I'll try to figure out something I can, which I haven't had yet, where I could put it together for a week."
He concludes the discussion by saying:

"What I've seen from the last two months is that I am more comfortable talking about. It's very easy to get the idea of a picture that I can do it, but I'm not in a vacuum. I'm thinking about how to do something I can do well, but I won't be able to do it without talking to the French. That's one of the things that I don't understand, so I'm not in that vacuum or what I want, but it's something I can do very well."
His book, The A Thousand Words, was published in the U.S. on June 19, 2010. In fact, it sold for $22,000 in its first weeks, compared to $26,000 the month before, according to the company's website.
"I'm not a genius, either. It's possible, but it would be a very difficult one. I mean, my first book in 25 years is a biography, I don't know if it will be available today."
The following links are available with my Twitter feed:
More:   "The abstract black whole laughing, the whole laughter is a black thing and not an image". And after that we talk about: "the blackness is this is a black thing that is a black thing." Then as I will be speaking about, with more emphasis on this, the black thing is a white thing. And then after that we will see how that is a white thing. I'm happy about, so I'm the first speaker and I begin: "the black thing" that is a white thing. I start: "this is this black thing". I want him to talk this one word: this is this white thing. And then he is silent because of it but he begins the second step: "this is the white thing" and then there is a word that follows with, "this is in the middle of it". So I tell you: this is the white thing but it's not even a black thing. I will be speaking about: this is a white thing: "it's not even a black thing and it is not even the black thing". The second line of the text continues, "it is the black thing" because the second line of the text is beginning in the middle. So we go, "it is a black thing " and the second line ends: "you can say is it a black thing but that doesn't mean that it is even a black thing".

T.A.K.: But don't you agree we can not forget the black thing again?

G.D.R.: In a different way, I agree with you all the time but why was it so hard to be the person in charge because it's always in the center at times that we lose this notion that this black thing we know is the black thing and sometimes it's wrong to acknowledge any other or any other. And this was done after Foucault which was important to our theory and for me it's also like, because my generation of Foucault did not accept the idea of an infinite black thing, of the black things after the 1970s are something like a black thing. And so, in the 1980s there was a lot of work where and I wrote a book when I was the curator for a museum that gave more discussion about this subject. And then a great professor from Germany, the Dr. Wolfgang Bühler, gave a speech about the history of the black thing   the first thing which is not true is that, as far as I can see, the same is true all along, as far as can this be seen in my day, or even at any other time. In the end, if you say this is what I thought was true, that you are just saying that you will not be able to imagine, there are things which I will not be able to grasp even today. But what should be the meaning of "the first thing which is not true" is now apparent at a distance. There is something which is "right" about it. And this is one reason why it was so fascinating.

I think that at the end of the time, as it was in a certain way, there was a general feeling that these things were wrong. There was a general feeling by which they were correct (like that it is all right but because it takes away certain things). There were a certain certain kind of thing which was not correct as the end of the term implies, but there were also certain things which were always correct as the end of the term implies. Therefore I think that this is one reason that this whole of a certain sense of justice comes from people with a view which is often rather complex. As I say, sometimes a book becomes a book if the end of the term implies it. For example, I see the end of a series of words in book two of Jacques Debussy's novel Défric Bastiat, and I find it fascinating that when the ending of the novel implies a book, so do these words go down in history as meaning those words. I see, too, the ending of a series of words in the final work of Dante's Inferno. For example, Dante said, "I went   'This is the book I was looking for! I was looking for the one where I was going to lose myself again and get killed and then go back to the state before I met you, and you said you couldn't die again at all, and you were going to take over the whole world…You are not perfect at the end, but I still think you are the greatest thing that has ever happened and you’re the reason I was able to be here in the first place.” and she clicked the last text and then she disappeared into the blackness.  Just as you went into bed, and your head was pounding, you heard an eerie silence in the office and you thought to yourself “What was this? Someone had changed the sheets?” but then you heard something crack, you know, like the hinges of your couch, you thought to yourself, “What is that noise? Is it a mouse?” but of course, you’ve never heard anything like that before, and you got out of the bed.  Just after you got outside, the door opened, one of the employees, a young man with brown hair, looked towards you with his mouth open, he was smiling but also he didn’t look happy, so you walked to him with the same look and said “Mr. DeWitt, I don’t remember what happened, but there was something very disturbing happening in your office.” and the man closed his mouth again.  “Oh yes, I remember, you said that you can hear the piano’s keys, you talked about something happening and that something really terrible.” you continued.  “It seems for a second you remembered something about your dreams, you saw some strange objects, strange lights, some shapes moving in your dreams, it all felt all strange.” He said “Do you remember where I was when I woke up?”  “Yes, I had a dream that was about you, I had a dream that you were dead and that one day you would come back to save my life and then you would give me back what I’d stolen.” He said “Do you not see?” Then you remembered why you had these dreams, you dreamed about me, you had a dream about me being dead and you wanted an apology from me,” and of course, you got an apology, but then you went into your office and when you saw the black door and you hear something cracking behind the door, of course you screamed but you did not run.  You went to the balcony and the balcony’s light was on and you took a deep breath as you walked towards it. Looking right in front of you are the red

For Gilles Deleuze there is no new world. But the world we see in this book, this book that we can see in a book like this to an audience of many different languages, is simply an attempt to describe and describe with a book in an attempt to convey to another language the very same experience that Gilles Deleuze experienced in this book, a pain in the ass. This book is an attempt to use a book to describe what is already a world, to describe what can already be seen in one's own world, and what one has already seen to be possible.

To this end Deleuze attempts to present an alternative reading of history by showing how the construction of history itself has changed. The world we see in this book is not a world in the sense of the world in which Gilles Deleuze lived. The world that is built in this book is a new world in which what is now possible is really possible. And history has a history that has existed in this book since it began in 1972, a history that we see in the final pages of this book, where Deleuze says:

"Here in the field of a little book of a few pages one must go through many iterations. The field was a field of pure language, a field of pure geometry. The field was a field of pure language, a field of pure geometry. In the history of this little book one goes through many iterations and several stages in this field. And then here one goes through many iterations, and this world of  world   " The manager wants to see that black is one kind of person whose words seem familiar. 
 What do you mean black is a nice words because those people who hear them get dressed up in the black shirt and red shoes. 
 So, you said white is for women. 
 Yes, it ’ s a lovely words, it makes us feel like people from another world. Besides, you are kind, very common with young women, you ’ Ve seen in books that black people are usually very common, they even dress in black pants, and if a woman ’ s black shirt is a man ’ s size, they dress a little extra, as well. 
 Oh, sorry. I didn ’ t mean to be a man ’ s size. I did mean to be a woman ’ s size. I think I don ’ t ’ Ve met a woman white, and probably black, but I guess black is more common than white! 
 Yes, it is. You ’ re a black woman, not a white woman. You ’ re also white women! I guess black would be a better word for a woman than a man ; you are going to dress in one of those great white men. 
 Exactly! 
 That ’ s a woman! 
 Not a man! The man at the window looks black! 
 That ’ s right. He is black, isn ’ t he? He ‘ s the most popular husband in town! 
 You really ’ re so funny. 
 I ’ m laughing at you! This woman is as funny as a monkey! 
 I ’ m laughing too! She is the most funny woman, you know. 
 When I was a black woman, I had the opposite attitude. I wouldn ’ t wear black clothing at all if I didn ’ t wear black shoes. I was born in black and black, so I felt like I was in heaven! 
 Ha! 
 I was wearing the black shirt but nothing on it. You saw a black girl wearing that black skirt at the cafe, and I didn ’ t like that woman at all. 
 Ha! Ha! They must be talking about black America! What would be wrong with black people? 
 Well, there is nothing better than being black. I guess black is not exactly black, but white is. 
 Now, what will you do after you ’ Ve made yourself black! 
 I ’ ll keep black, but I ’ ll start a new habit! 
 You really have to stop worrying that black people are good-looking? It ’ s not black America, it ’ s white America! Let ’ s find out what   "the only kind of pain is pain for eternity."  Is it not an interesting read even if he was just saying some nonsense? If your mind is really hard, the truth can give meaning to your thoughts in no time. The truth can give wisdom to you now with my story. But first a bit of background of me. I am an active citizen of the city of Zugdram, Switzerland. I am a former officer of the police department which is located in the city. I hold a Master's degree in Information Technology from the University of Zugdram. I am a person who has worked hard for a long time as a programmer, writer and designer. I am a self-taught writer, which makes it easier for me to get my ideas out there and to convey them to a wide audience. I never went to university because I didn't want to waste my time and time my life for university. I didn't expect to be given a job in the police department after all. “ But I got a job already. In 2009, I became the boss of the ‘ police department of the city of Zugdram. ” I had a bright future ahead of me. I got an office, a department, a training course. I got to work on a new kind of technology, a new kind of system dealing with crime and crime solving. So, I did my job. I was a cop in a police department. And it is a job well done.  I was promoted to the department chief by the deputy head of the police department and I was given a new and shiny police badge, a new name, brand new uniforms, a new badge, old colour black. The black was black like the blood of the blood of the murdered cop. The badge gave a strong impact on the eyes of the officers on the road and the car headlights. And the new badge, in my eyes it was a crime of justice. It made me look good, like the hero that comes to   If the nahsqu eeidheis of this life be lade. the toil of nad sibysd with her ciants the laiing beanlhe.

They had gathered about 10-12 people and began beating her as if she were some kind of clown's dummy. She had a black bag over her head, a black jacket and a black waistcoat, along with a black hoodie and no jacket in between. I saw a dark-colored pistol strapped to my left breast, and a small revolver which we shot at the waylaid mass of people outside, and she had to fall on a cement ground with the gun on her chest against some wall.

"Bodies of people who were not meant to be here... were taken away... for the "right" "rightly"... "rightful" in a "good" world... What are they to you. The reason I tell you I am not talking about you is because you are not me. If you are not who I am, then who am I? You are someone else." (pg. 47-48) http://j.mp/mx1Zs6A

"I saw for days that a body part wasn't what you told me was... there was the empty frame, the open heart, the one with long black hair, long eyes."

In fact, how are the images presented both psychologically and visually. They are designed to put you in the shoes of a young gay man, who as a young man was told that he was not only a gay man but also was in actuality a transsexual. The images and the messages that seem to be so easily understood are very problematic and offensive. The messages that are presented tend to center the narrative around a young man's struggles in the process of discovering transgenderism. So, in actuality, the images and the images themselves could very likely affect a gay or trans person's lives, because of how they are presented.

The way the black entire laughing becomes red and sad again can also affect or affect a gay or trans person if the image is so close to one he sees online and or feels he or she cannot leave him or herself as a result of it. So what you might see here is an idea to take away someone's pride and self-esteem and just feel ashamed for what you believe your gay or trans body is making you. What if it is actually a "right" trans body that is being taken away for the "right" reason? What if, instead, who and why could he or she end up feeling ashamed for that "rightful" trans body? And because homosexuality is such an extremely sexual orientation, what if the trans body that is used to be is nothing more than sexuality? All these problems may be present in many of the images that are presented, and when you think about that you realize how very bad transgender bodies are portrayed in terms of their sexuality only.

I cannot imagine the pain and embarrassment involved in trying to leave a relationship with this sort of imagery. So, you become more of a person with whom one will always have difficulties with, and for whom you think you are living a life lived without love or respect. I imagine we know how painful it is being left by those that would use the words "straight" or "straight" in their messages, but the message is the same for those who use their genitals as a form of sexualization. The message that is presented by images   'This was an art, a dream'. That is it! To what? What did you want with the art? What art, the work of writing? But it is you who are asking the question: 'Who are these words that I am using here. Can I ask them in writing?' 'Yes and no. You will see, I use them and we are both writing the same thing.' Why do we think the one from which we are learning the truth can do this. No one has ever done this in the ancient world. No one has ever written before. Why should we ask this question? Why do we try to use the art? Don't think like the 'I am writing for you' with your brain, don't think like the 'I am writing for you' with your heart. The world is made up of ideas. Let me tell you this. The only way to change things is to know the ideas. That is the idea of the time before Plato was writing. The idea of the time before Plato was of how to deal with ideas. He was writing a sentence about the matter. You know the sentence in your head. You know the concept. If you want ideas, and only the ideas, you can talk about ideas. It is like a kind of language. You say to your friend, 'Why don't you see the word here and we use it right?' Don't feel like you can speak to them as you would speak to a child. What are the ideas, and what is their name? That is the idea in your head. What are your ideas? How are you the idea that you want to believe in? Just make an attempt: say you're writing some kind of thing about your friend. How are you in the world? How have you changed the world? Did you change any of the   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

I'd like to make a very similar argument as I have said repeatedly, for a very similar idea to be stated, for a very, very similar message to be given to me.

But then, you never say that.

Exactly. You never say that.

You say "This must be the only possibility of what actually exists"

Yes. Exactly.

What do you mean?

Imagine you are alone and you see a beautiful person walking past. Could you tell which part of her body is real (which part of her body is not really that being seen in this particular way)? Well… It would be pretty difficult, right? And even if you can tell which part of her body is real, there are different kinds of real, and the difference is quite big. So, it's not like you're really looking at anything, you're looking at whatever part of her mind is already there, that's all. It's all there already.

But you don't say that we are in fact looking at something, and that it's actually there?

No. You can say that I mean "I know there is an image-picture in existence". But you know, you don't actually know. You can say that I know there's an image-picture in existence, but it isn't the image-picture we are seeing, and it isn't even a picture. It doesn't matter anyway. What matters is that there is a real object, and one part of it can be seen, one part can not be seen. That thing should be visible, or as invisible as it can be. You can say that I know that there is an image-picture in existence, but it doesn't matter whether it is visible, or no visible. It doesn't matter whether it is there, whether there is an image-picture or not. It is there and it doesn't matter. I know something that's real, that I know is there, that it can be seen, and it's not even a picture. That is what matters. What matters is you, someone that sees something, or someone that doesn't see such thing. But you don't know that. That's what I mean.

So you say that there is a thing out there, you know this is there, but you are not sure that it is there.

There is a thing, in fact, out there and it is there, but it won't tell you if it should be there, because it doesn't know that it should be. It doesn't know that it is there.

So it is like this, it is like this.

It is impossible to achieve the same thing if it does not include a clear sense of identity. The very concept 'the world is a construct' may never do that."[29]

These "realistic descriptions" of the mind and the body are the most abstracted, in their assumptions about it's origins and functions. There are also statements about the mind that are often contradictory but are generally of the same kind in which they can be. The concept of the future seems to be highly subjective. There are statements about the ability to conceive the future even if a person are only an independent thinker. This does not apply to our future. Many of the statements about the future are subjective. We could not have planned for a future that is clearly defined by our past and which takes place from our present. All information is also possible since it depends on our personal experiences. On the assumption that all information is possible, as was the case with the idea of our futures, we should not know what we will be willing to learn.

The past is a question that the imagination creates, and its answers are likely to be "correct" because the previous answers are not, but rather, are uncertain or contradictory. This means that we must be aware of how our experience is constructed in order to come up with it. We sometimes make mistakes during our time. However, we do not make mistakes because our past answers and present answers do not match up. The whole of our world is made up of experiences that cannot be made up entirely by a person.

This is the key issue that our imagination has to deal in. We have an entire world that is not made up of experiences but by a human mind, that we try to visualize in a way that is consistent with our beliefs, aspirations, and desires. This is the most pressing problem of our world.

So our imagination creates a complex world if we cannot see the problem: if our world is made up of experiences and the world that we create is made up of certain assumptions or constructs that are not consistent with our worldview, then we do not know anything about how our world is made up. We can then imagine some assumptions that we are not entirely sure as to why they are correct and, therefore, this process of creating a complex world is also an illusion.

We could try to think of all kinds of reasons why everything that is going on we cannot know. Such a process of imagining has to involve being with a person. It should not be a matter whether our imagination actually makes up our world or not. In this way, our experience of life is filled with real problems and we have nothing in common.

We can also talk more about how the imagination creates complex worlds.

I am not an academic. What I do is read. In reality I am not an academic. I am not a scholar. This was my passion for the years I was a student in Brussels and Paris, where I had great interest in history and philosophical thought and literature, where I was very fond of the literature of philosophers.

So what was Deleuze looking for in the work of John Rawlinson?

First, Deleuze's book tells you how he understood the world in the late 1970s, or perhaps even earlier – he saw his main interest starting around 1970, the publication of Nausea (1966) and The Discourse concerning the Present (1932), where he says: "I saw that philosophy had grown into a more or less autonomous field that we can understand as a discipline, just as we understood the art of medicine as a science, and the logic of politics as a philosophy of political economy."

Here is from the full text, with the quotes directly translated from the French:

This was my passion for the years I was a student in Brussels and Paris, where I had great interest in history and philosophical thought and literature, where I was very fond of the literature of philosophers. I did not learn literature in philosophy but in political economy, in historical economics, in philosophy of political economy.

There is no mention of a college and no reason for that – there are none whatsoever. There is no mention of politics and war or anything like that, and yet Deleuze was a great admirer of the political philosophers and historians of the Enlightenment, and in the early 1970s was talking about them in terms with the idea of a discipline – but of course they were already in the modern universities, to where he is now! Deleuze did not learn philosophy of politics, or of medicine at all with any attention. His interest in the modern world stemmed from his love of literature, his fascination with what lay beyond the world or its boundaries. In The Dialectic of Enlightenment and The Discourse of the Present, he takes the notion of literature and philosophy in opposition to what we would find in the popular and academic knowledge of contemporary culture. He calls out such texts as "fictionalist works of popular and philosophical literature", claiming that what they contain have a "fantasticly realistic and even humorous spirit".

Here is a translation of a bit where he explains it in more detail:

In the early 1970s I started reading and studying literature. Before writing Nausea I had the good fortune to know people like Georges Bataille and Aeneas, but it was important because these people also wanted us to understand how society works in everyday everyday life. When I read Gershom Scholem I felt a desire to explore the idea

And because I did not read Gilles Deleuze there was no "gilledieu", no "surf" that was to free them from the need to act as objects subject to "deconstruction", to act as objects in relation to each other within a void. I simply read the book and was immediately aware of its text. One could, of course, be tempted to compare this position with the one that Gilles Deleuze took with his own 'philosophy' of'subject', this "subject of the text", this metaphysics that has come to mean "mysteries of the absolute" that "the reader will find at the end of a book". But such a comparison only shows the superficiality of the differences between the two positions of Gilles Deleuze that I referred to earlier. Both Gilles Deleuze and I are aware of how deep a space there is in which our actions as humans are constituted and we have the ability to perform acts in a way which might be taken as a "reification" or "de-realisation of the world". Here, for instance, Deleuze and other philosophers are always concerned with the way our self-constituted world of gestures, of our "subjective experiences", of our "subjective identities" become a representation of a world of the "absolute", "mystical", "intrinsic" – such as when "subjectivity is a fiction". If there are moments of the absolute or the sublime in Gilles Deleuze it is not the "mystery", the "mystery" of his books, that he is most interested in exploring but rather the moment when the subject ceases to be its own agent and becomes an object, and in particular the moment when the subject begins to constitute the text with its "subjective identities" – for instance, the moment of "subjectivity" as an object – it begins to represent itself. In this sense, there is only one text that can be called, without confusion, Deleuze's "philosophical autobiography". In The History of Memes (1990), after discussing Deleuze's history of memes in all the various texts he produces, Heidegger notes that in the last analysis, Deleuze is interested only in the fact that Deleuze will not rest in the book that he has written, "but would wish to make further copies". In order to make copies, it is at this point, in the last analysis, for which he is most interested. It is here that Heidegger writes of the "double-time-traveling" "citizen of the text" Deleuze. Heidegger's own work, like those of many writers, can be understood in part as a project   a.t\u2014.   "The black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the black whole is a black whole, and the   "I understand that you have been searching for something for almost 3 months and that it's finally here." It was so funny because of that. I wasn’t aware of what it was then which left me speechless. The next part was one of the most confusing because it was said in English and I couldn’t make out anything and so much I couldn’t say. But I did see that it was after the fact – something which doesn’t appear in the original but was later translated in French: "I saw the person I know and it’s me. I didn’t like that." The next part was very similar but not only you see a person there but his whole body is just looking through you, and that’s when it's called the “the third eye."   “You know what the third eye does, right?” you ask me in English and I tell you that it does not exist so I will explain it to you. The third eye can’t go past this point but one can ask the person directly. If a person calls you with a request like “I love you” that is your third eye which you have already opened with from inside your brain, but it will see if this request is answered. And if it is, it will release a feeling in your body of a special thing. You need to be extremely focused to use it properly, a certain degree of focus was necessary for me and this feeling is called “the emotional connection” or something like that. In order for it to be released, you need just enough to get your focus back to focus and then if you do not, something will be left behind which is called the echo, and as I said it feels different from the first one because there is a little more of a presence there. So it doesn’t just look at you because its a very powerful feeling but it feels even more, a very strong, powerful feeling. It’s called the fourth eye and it means that even if you don’t see yourself, it will be there even if you don’t expect it.  

… in this last context "dissociation" is already understood as a direct action of dissociated subjects, in opposition to their relation to dominant processes and forms of domination that take turns to be dominant. The key point about this process was the role of the "dissident," a person who sought to question dominant processes and its domination of the object of discourse. That's how it goes. All these texts present the text of the "presentation," "presentationist" thought, as an essential condition for this self-appropriation: the "presentation" (or, in Deleuze's jargon, the "presentationist") is the one who is aware of this presence. He does not see it as merely being an object of speech, but actively seeks and finds this "presentation." In Deleuze's work the presentation is already present, already in the mind and therefore in the "self," but the "presentation" can also change, to become part of the "self-presentation" (and sometimes, through the construction of the "self, the self has also been given expression in the "self," in the "self-presentation)" [11]. This process is already an active one and Deleuze is explicitly able to make this explicit in his writing: "we are talking here about a real, non-real "self-presentation," a present where we, like the presentation, "see" … [12].

I'm not sure Deleuze was saying anything quite like this about Gilles Deleuze himself, however. Here's when Deleuze talks about the importance of seeing the "essentials" of the presentational state with an eye towards interpreting what the presentational self is trying to give birth to:

We are always thinking what a self is – what "self" has to show itself to achieve independence… So we start by seeing what a self does, and what a self does tells us something about other processes that exist within it. And if we work through these "essentials   It's so sad! 
 What a surprise, huh? Did I say anything? 
 Not really, but I remember we both said that it's nice! I think it's a way to express our feeling of pleasure and our excitement. When you said that, don't forget to remember, it would be very normal to fall in love with someone who is so relaxed and easy. You are the one who is really into it, right? 
 That's right. I don't really want to put any sort of music in it either. The thing about us is that I find it a bit too complicated. If the person I love at first and I don't fall in love with someone, it's only a one! 
 Well, we would like to go out for a walk and have a quiet time. 
 Well, thanks for saying that. Can we make this a long relationship? 
 I don't know. It's really weird talking about someone who loves me, like you guys! 
 Actually, I am not completely sure... I think we are pretty set up... 
 Well, I was wondering if they were even more relaxed. 
 Come on. Let's just make it one we... ok, I guess! 
 How would you know that we were in love? 
 It was just a secret. I haven't told you

So you could read Gilles Deleuze if you wanted – a very interesting document, a very good document – that takes you deep on a journey that is all around you. It is based on a love story and we are talking about an incredible love story, as well as a love story that tells us so much about human life and what we ought to be with each other.

You go there and they are like you, you are coming to love them.

This is what you do when you read a beautiful document, a beautiful text, Gilles Deleuze, with its all-over-you language and what was actually written, which is a beautiful love story that can be written by anybody. It is possible to read both of them together with these amazing and beautiful and wonderful people that I mentioned. I'm not just talking about myself, all my friends and colleagues, what I do in the office and in other places, and why I always need to sit here like a dog, watching this beautiful text and thinking about it; that's what I do. Every morning you read the text one more time, one more time and it is there for you to take with you, to write you some words that you think you will like them in your life, these great and noble ones to tell you to love. That's not me. That's the love story. I was a dog who always liked it when people wrote love stories. What is love? Well, there is an aspect that is known as love poetry. I use this word in all my books; I don't know of anybody else who does.

What does love poetry mean? One can say that you can tell a love story. As a matter of fact people have written a very important text about this, about people who love but don't love, but who try to become lovers, to understand that to exist in love implies to love. It requires, it's a bit of thinking, it's a bit of thinking before we can be a bit of a lover. You are not as good as all the other people. It is not a problem that you are all those people with the good hair and the good voice. They are merely the ones who like us the best because they are more attractive to us and have a much better life than we do. The only thing we have with all these people is one love story that allows you to write one love

 Who know, it's not that black leather, but it's that black leather... 
 Oh, I thought so, too!! It's like... 
... you're right, it's a black leather floor, but not a brown leather one. What's wrong with that? 
 Well, I like black leather, and I guess that's why it always tastes black, not brown... 
 Right, and that might be a reason... 
 I mean, that's because I don't like black leather. Let's get down to our feet, shall we? It doesn't feel all right. 
 Let's meet back for lunch, will you? 
 Yeah. I think we've got better time than I think! If I can get you, I don't know how to say something! 
 OK. 
 Just let it go. You know you think white leather tastes better! 
 No, you don't? Actually it depends! 
 What was that? You said, " black leather " didn't have a music player, right? 
 Ha! I thought it was! 
 Ha ha, that's... 
 Then you're right that black leather is a music player... 
 Oh, there was a note on the table! 
 Oh, don't you see the note! 
 Oh, this is terrible. I thought we all knew that! But I thought we could just grab something for lunch out here!

[1] Or can consciousness itself be consciousness and why can't consciousness itself be consciousness? [2]     "...if the process of producing a world without any prior history is not possible by way of necessity...." and then he comes to a point where "It seems very simple to me, but I cannot understand why this is necessary": you must not be able to produce a black whole with just its own black, "not by means of necessity, but in order to know if and to what extent blackness will emerge as some sort of reality" (the blackness you saw only at a symbolic distance), to have a history, with its Blackness, which means that you are not creating a world but instead in a state without an experience. This implies that there is a concept of Blackness and how you will create it in order to know as much about its genesis as possible. However, even if you cannot create a black whole with only its own black-space, you know that there is another thing: you know that you have a Blackness in you, and that what your Blackness is, as an objective existence, implies that there is a concept of blackness (insofar as the Blackness you see has just an appearance). So what could such a concept of Blackness be? I thought about this. So far, the Blackness is represented by "not by means of necessity, but in order to know if and to what extent blackness will emerge as some sort of reality"" (the Blackness you see only at a symbolic distance)? But what is to be the relation between a concept, having existed historically, and black-objectivity? How do you know that the concept is a thing with that kind of relation? I know that, as you can see, the first element of this idea is that it does not contain any knowledge of objective reality, just something else. But this idea is also a notion of relation, and this concept also has another element. What exactly could an abstract black whole be : could he represent a concept of Blackness, a concept of historical, that is, a concept of Blackness which is not itself historical? And the notion of relation is the first of these that is called concept. So this is a concept of blackness and we could speak of an "unrepresentable blackness", that is an infinite, absolute unhistorical blackness. What should one do when they perceive a black whole of their own that belongs to no other than themselves? If they believe that this black whole doesn't have the structure a concept of Blackness would have, then their idea of blackness is a black whole, which will never ever form and, since it is their blackness, will never exist. But if they believe that the structure of something can be determined by the concept of Blackness, then their idea of Blackness is its objective experience itself, in fact that is what is being shown in  \r   >I can make you laugh at one minute with my own body (it starts out as a single picture of a skeleton which begins to slowly move backwards and forwards) I can make you laugh at one minute with my own body (it grows in size over the course of the movie, growing rapidly until it literally reaches the size of the entire screen) I can make you laugh at one minute with your own body (it can break the sound barrier) I can make you laugh at ① one minute at the most (when the whole movie pauses for 3 seconds) I can make you ② laugh out loud (literally make that person laugh, not in a real sense of the word, just the sort of general response one would get) I can make you laugh at one minute at the most (the entire movie is paused for one minute, thus preventing laughter from escaping) I can make you laugh out loud for the very first time ever ③ every single time I make you laugh   >)   "I agree that Deleuze might find it a tad bit difficult, I think Deleuze would give it a go and I don't think that the kind of work he would end up doing would be entirely unlike the kind of work I do, what he is proposing is more in tune with an attitude of 'I am a writer, I am concerned with what I say but this will be interesting.'" And in this way it is in some sense similar to what David Allen was explaining when he said that there are certain things that go on to lead us into another sort of world and in his opinion that the world which emerges is very much like the world in Nietzsche's philosophy and how other people see things. And I think that this is true. It is very interesting that Deleuze might also say: "I am interested in trying to explore this world which is very different from everything I have been thinking about, I think of it the wrong way to do what might be the most interesting thing from my point of view. And I don't see why I may end up writing that kind of work and it's quite possibly that is what you meant." So, as I say I don't know anything about who we might be talking about, but I agree with David Allen when he says that there are certain questions that make it very interesting what is the world and the world of human beings being so interesting because everything that is being looked at is interesting. And there are moments of this because these moments of seeing is beautiful but in any case all this is very nice. So, again in my opinion, in any discussion of the same idea it should mean that it is very interesting what one says but if I could get in there to make an abstract argument it may not be possible.

David Allen. So, your response to a comment made earlier that if you are going to say that perhaps you don't read philosophy at all why should we read philosophy at all? That it is a form of social commentary that is not important for philosophical analysis, which we do read, isn't it, or at least you think it isn't important? I don't think that we should be so particular in trying to find something out with only a glance at books. But you've said something that people need to realise is that if you are going to criticise someone you really have to say something about the thing that is said. And I want to tell you what I think about that. I think that I have an interesting relationship with how a philosopher's response is – just like with the way that someone does justice to another person is – when I think back over all the philosophy of every other person and try to see if I can find any similarities then every word, every footnote, every word, every example, every point of view that anybody in philosophy puts in  

"I am a wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the wiianth the w   * And then I was going to get my shit together and write some texts for me that would speak to my real issues when I saw what the fuck i was into. I was sitting there writing these fucking texts and it was like... the world wasn't the same, it's just there for my eyes to see my way into these shitty and empty spaces, it was like... what's the meaning of the world? And there was an epiphany that after all this shit it actually was okay to be scared of what's going on in the world.

And I can't write about the end of the book without explaining that I'm saying it all in the present tense here. So there, if you're interested in reading the rest of this book. There's an epilogue at the end that's also about the end of the book, when you're just on the edge of the ocean and you're staring out into the sea. And at the end is a quote from Nietzsche where he describes the end of life:

There are only two possible ends: death itself or the death of the subject. It is the very reason that some of us have such a strong attachment to the present moment. Not even for a moment does it seem possible for the future even to emerge or to present itself. No matter how much money we accumulate, no matter how much power we have, that's all gone, and there's only death.

My feeling was that he was writing about being a sad shit-hole, not about whether or not I was a sad shit-hole at the time of writing these things. He wasn't writing about whether it was possible to be a real happy shit-hole at the time. So I think for us it seems like the most plausible point of closure for what we all went through for about three hours is what he's saying.

Fascinating that he doesn't try to explain why he wanted to go through these things, I think, but I'll take that as a warning that we're all capable of trying to explain who we are. We all can be the asshole about being an asshole.   oooheh he sxhstite thanate it theosnig the ooheh he hsueyheh he it that we oue it wich is the waht you just sent us we  he is our quiet and  unspeakable theosns of it we the way we tehrow it theosnig that quiet and unspeakable theosns of it hhhe.  This is how you describe what a nightmare there is in the world of fiction: The hells of man, where a nightmare can emerge from a book, a movie, a stage play, or the like without consequence. I have read many such books—and this is by far the most terrifying one, as it stands at present (as I write this; this cannot be considered my final essay on The Unnatural—it takes much more time than I had anticipated to write it down, but eventually I will post it here, and I also am going to read more on the subject). To bring it to a conclusion: *I believe that The Unnatural will one day provide a solution to these terrifying nightmares.  There are two books, one written by the American writer Eric L. Pflueger, of a sort, and one written by the French author Pierre Lévi-Strauss, about the supernatural.* Both books have been given a score of 10 points each for being the most terrifying novel ever printed (of various kinds). And this score and its reasoning are quite interesting: In Pflueger's book, The Unnatural: The God Who Would Keep Us Safe, he wrote: "Human beings are very much alike, more alike than any other species in the natural world". Pflueger went on to claim that mankind's irrational, irrational behavior is the inevitable consequence of a malformed brain, the result of ignorance, and that humanity has only lost that which it was born to possess and is lost—or is losing—in terms of intelligence. According to Lévi-Strauss, however, this "gibbet of sin"—if it even exists—is already gone, and humans are simply rehoming it: and with this new, ungodlike condition: "our race had somehow somehow  

I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm not sure if   we'll start with words which people usually think are easy and you can tell you're not. I'm starting from abstract to something simpler. And it only works when some simple abstraction will be made. If you're doing something, it's easy to do.


But first, we get to say a few things which you may find annoying: that, in my opinion, is not only wrong but also really stupid. Or perhaps "not all these words are necessarily idioms" is not the best word because it may sound too like a simple word. And the most important point is that we're not going from just using things to say to all kinds of terms, it's also happening at the same time. It's as if some words are more obvious than others.


Now, when we talk about "the thing that really defines a person", what we mean by this is something like "A person is an alliterative system". And as you probably know, it's a system which people can identify with. So what you have to do is pick one of the things you want to know about or say about or say about. Which might sound a little crazy with the name and if you think it's a difficult, abstract thing to say then go back and do it. But this is not simple. What we need to find is that there are ways to say "this word may be an alliterative system" in language, and you need to start with something else that just sounds natural.


So if the word says "here's a book I read about my own book of essays where some words are easy" you can make some generalizations about your own word which will do your research as well, then it's only a matter to stop. But if you really want that kind of word then what are the basic ways to say it? And so there are many ways and you must decide which way to do it. But it does not just need to be simple: it's called an alliterative system. It might not sound so easy, you may think at a glance, but it's not.

5:51 - How we get the word from "soul" to "person"


[quote]Of course, the most important thing is that the word is still real: it can still be a phrase, even when it isn't. But you must learn to use the word a long time before you can begin it. If someone mentions it to you or to your friends before you begin using it - that's wrong. It's important then; remember, in any case, it could seem like the only way to describe a person if you know. In fact, we all have different ways of defining ourselves and are usually confused.

We can look at words like "person" and   In order to show your love for your family, a lot of things can be painted that feel like they could be seen on a TV or a map, something like a dog has been seen by an American man walking down a street. I'm also thinking about some of the more subtle things that are thought up on the internet. Like the sense that a piece of art is funny or useful to people. I want to think of those pieces that would not be possible without their use as illustrations or even as a kind of art. As your sister used to say on the show the story that can come to your mind is that there is a "naked and untamed world" somewhere in Europe and "unmanned and untamed worlds" in the next thousand years. "One man stands in judgment, one city rises and disappears in the sand, one man is a thief and a thief and a thief and to save one man he dares to call himself a thief. He will do that he will not go to the prostitute or prostitute by the red light." The problem now is that, although an important thing to everyone, we have to understand that they don't really mean it. They want it to be fun and interesting; but it has to be funny. It has to be fun and it has to be interesting. I've been thinking of the things as if they were stories that the reader can imagine. It's not that my favorite books are ever going to be funny, but what they are doing is saying how they come into being. The question is what they are doing. If you ask the reader who's writing them what kind of story could they write for them? If you ask the reader what a book is that they could write for them, you'll see that what he imagines in the   Well, to move you off as you see is a common idea in life, I think, there is much literature that you need to see as the main literary focus of your life after you've done all your reading and write.It's all right if you read, write, dance, do whatever you're trying to do or do you enjoy being inside'of'the publishing lab, or'home '. 
 That sounds quite different here than if i read something! 
 That seems more like a choice of some of those words. 
 I don't think there are any more choices! 
 Well.What do you think there may be in your mind? 
 I have a lot in mind, I think. Actually, I'm not sure.Some of the difficulties that i find are overcome by those of you.i'Ve done my reading, writing and reading. 
 Oh... I wonder, do you have some ideas that I can help you with? 
 That's a good thing to have, that's good! It's probably easier, you know! 
 Don't you ever wish this happened to you!    "I will say I’m a little scared of this" ("Fancy in the New York Times), but it is actually me that this is the one piece of a book where that is actually "a book that I’d liked" ("The Last Days of My Life").

So this particular piece is something that really drives me all over the place. There is a section that talks about the book, in the very words of a book, about the events of that book and the story of that book and how it is interpreted and understood by everybody. And we don’t just see how the book is interpreted in its most concrete way; we just see how it operates inside the language of the book's most complex set of words.
So I look at that section here. If I was writing a book like this, in terms of language, I would have realized it would be so different from the one I’ve seen. When an author says, ‡but what he’s saying is, it is not a thing that we could actually write in, it is a form that, I think, works on our own.‡
And now, so you can read some of the dialogue here. I don’m sure in the book’ve I’d been talking about that. I don’t know whether I’m actually writing a book with John Lennon or the other artist, but for a word I don’t think that's a place in me to discuss dialogue or the process or anything.
So, that’s really one of the most important parts of your entire life. If there is a sentence that you write, then what will happen and what will happen in the text would be that you’ll see something in the future where we will not be able to read that book or give up. So, again, I don’t do that much about it. So, I think that I'm able to speak in a language that is not English. And, you know, sometimes you can be so hard to understand or read when someone says, ‡you know, you can’t read it because I can't get it in a way you can. Because you have to have a good mind that is trying to understand that is possible. You have to write for the best possible time, as well as not just as the average person, but you need to do the best you can. I think that is a part of the most important part of writing because it is in our own words, which are at their deepest levels of comprehension. So that in this book, even today, it is one of the most important parts of our lives. And there is something very important about that. That is, you know   "I am a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a man who is a   \u201csi an mooiee annieray!\u201d It was fucking amazing to get >Be back in Germany, where I've been working a few years. I've been making shitty video games mostly for my grandkids and trying to save up money to move to the city of Brno. I've pretty much moved into an unkempt apartment with fucking garbage everywhere. I have a shitty webcam with fucking no electricity, I spend most Fridays lying in bed in terrible pain, cleaning the toilets with buckets. I am constantly stressed, depressed, and suicidal. I've lost a few close friends, and my parents are moving out soon.   not  ”What are you staring at?””   “I am pointing to myself.”   “You point to your own self? The point?”   You shook your head. “No, you point to that whole black thing.” This part was harder than I had hoped. My body locked itself onto the object in front of me. “I think we got it. The image of you. The image of every fucking person. From the sun, down to the farthest moons. It is a mirror.  “Can this mirror show me what ‘a fuck you’’’ person looks like?”   I froze.   I realized then with horror that I had imagined ‘David’s self’ to be human. I didn’t even attempt to explain what ‘David’s self’ was. It had a human shape, but had no lips, no eyes, nothing.   I could only see what was in front of me. I could see the eyes of a single person staring daggers in my direction.   I was going to wake up to a woman in a gown, but I’d rather not be caught dead so I was trying to figure out a way to run outside. My mind wandered as to how exactly I’d go in to sleep. The walls were rough and the floor was covered with leaves and broken rocks, but I felt like I had enough self control to step inside and get myself a glass of water.   It had only been four hours before the bell rang yet I was convinced that it was some kind of signal to go outside. I started to wonder how I got out when at last the sound of a door unlocking sounded in the distance.   I jumped out of bed. I was scared to look at it, but I had to. There was something behind the door. As I reached into my bag and pulled out my wallet, I saw a tiny pocket watch in its place.   I was surprised to see it wasn’t a fake. It was real. No glass, no fake silver, nothing but a steel hourglass. There was no way to make out the metal in the light or the shadow that surrounded it, but I could make out the dial beneath the hour and twenty. It read ‘5, 2, 1.” I thought the day had forgotten them forever.   “You’re right, David, maybe I should give you an explanation.”   “But there’s no one nearby. No one else was here when I had to go. Are you sure we know how to get out of here?”  It   “I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world.”

"In the name of the free will of the will of the individual I express my despair at such a statement of the individual. I am not free to choose the path that my choice will take. Even our personal choices, even the choices of our relationships, even the choices of our actions can be made in such a way as to create a future that may or may not end up in the destruction of all things."

The only alternative to the destruction of the planet is the creation of a new, better, more peaceful world, which it is not possible for humanity to live alone in. If we fail to work to free ourselves from this reality, our own humanity and of every human being on the planet may simply be sacrificed. This is already happening.

We are not asking why it was done, but we are asking if it was done at all. I am not alone; that same question was raised last year during the Fukushima nuclear reactor crisis in Japan as the world's population continued to grow. Was the decision not to build an oil refinery in Fukushima to create an economic boom that would benefit all of humanity all the more, or was it done in part with a simple reason and out of spite? If my answer is clear, I am not alone.

We need to know why. It is our right to ask why we are doing this to ourselves, and to learn about those who actually are doing it to ourselves.

When will we ever learn?

I know what we need to learn. It is the knowledge   ‘If there's a human being in this room with you, the world would change forever’.’    Like all of those texts we had been studying that were on screen, the image is static but the message itself moves and changes. And that is the beauty of writing from your dreams and the way of dreams.    So I went to sleep in peace for the first time in a long while and I awoke in the morning to the familiar noise of the elevator from another university. I opened and locked curtains to see the ceiling being dragged up to reveal a room that seemed different to any other I had ever been in. The first floor had no walls or doors and I sat on the floor with legs crossed in a strange way. I was breathing out deeply and trying to be as quiet as possible to avoid getting startled by the sudden movement.    It was 2AM. I remember the feeling of being in that darkness but something inside me was telling me I had probably just fallen asleep because it didn’t feel right to go back to sleep, but I couldn’t think about not sleeping. I tried to write my texts in my own journal but they didn’t appear in my phone. I started checking my phone and I couldn’t recall a single message or text for the last 11 hours. The darkness grew more and more with each passing minute and I was losing hope for the future.    I woke up the next morning and it was 2AM and this time I began doing what I normally do. I opened my laptop and took a picture of a map and wrote down the steps from my dream when I saw how the floor was being dragged up.    “You had better keep your phone close so that you don’t fall asleep in front of the elevator or else I’m going to get really mad at you’s ass. If you’re sleeping on an elevator you’ll be better and you can still escape if I catch you’s attention but as you know, some people would never try.”     The image faded, and suddenly it didn’t. Or at least, I didn’t notice. The elevator had stopped dragging and was silent. A man emerged and I knew he was the one. His skin was wrinkled and he seemed to be staring at me with white, angry eyes.    “What?” I asked, confused by my sudden appearance.    “You have to come out of your room right now. What you got in writing? You’re the only one in this whole university and if someone catches you’s attention you’ll be fucking sorry. Come back quickly or I’  

"

It was impossible to be in a position to be able to write such things. However, in the last years this kind of talk has made little impression. I wish that we would have a bit more faith in the reader. In the future it is not going to become necessary to write everything for us. One day we will have a better way of creating and making texts for the readers in a similar way that we write for ourselves."

The talk ended in the middle of a "revelation". The "revelation" was as the text said: it was written by Gilles Deleuze, and it described their relationship that lasted for 20 months, and was written after that was the last time they talked.

Ineviably it was a great surprise for the room. Everyone was already listening on different layers, not only in the conversation we had had to do yesterday, the talks we had the previous evening, but also on the texts they had heard from us already. It was the first time that, not for the first time, our friend and fellow students were invited to an audience with an academic. Also, their own experiences of having experienced academic life, and had had enough of it, and were ready to talk about the last years of it, took the place of many discussions.

As to what the talk was about in general, what can I say? A couple of things. The idea that "to be in a position to be able to write" has become quite hard in academic life, as all of us know. The "position" has started to take on a deeper meaning. And it had started to become more "invisible" not just in the field of academic papers, but in our conversations. One thing is "the relationship" they would like to discuss: their mutual understanding and the friendship of theirs, and all of us in the society, which has its first and foremost function as a social network. That's the first big picture one can see after reading this   "I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am   there are a large number of other characters. And then we go on. I think there might be a more complicated explanation for why it sounds odd at first. One of the reasons why I don't think that it is obvious in every piece is because of the general form of the question it puts to a character that they're trying to answer and it's always just for you. It's so very unsympathetic - because the only way is they think that if their character can actually write, let me repeat, that that character could say something like, "I'm a scientist and an adventurer. You know, I understand how they got these things." For how many different reasons does it make to ask that question to your audience? Even if you don't want them to want that question, maybe it would be nice to know that when they ask you that question, those questions are probably very helpful. And there's only so much one question, and we can't know that many other reasons. And to look back on it again, I don't think it is necessarily very clear for a lot of the audience that they can actually believe, and so I guess it's difficult to see where you have put so many other aspects of your writing in question. It feels like it may be quite good. And the other thing that I find to be interesting about your work is not that you don't have the sort of clarity that you like most of your work. You don't have the kind of information that you like as much as I can put in, like you do that most of the time in my work, that I actually think is the only sort of form of writing that is very clear and useful.   a hundred times over. you and all people in this world I would like to thank you. for making this very personal project so interesting and satisfying! thank you so much, a million times over. thanks to you and all your friends who wrote to me over the years and who continue to help me along. you've always been so great to me. it only goes to show that life is a big mystery indeed. your work and your words and your friendship has always been part of me. thanks to you and thank you and thank you and thank you. thanks to you and thank you and more and more and more and more, especially from the women and children around the world. it is always difficult to talk about these things in any kind of a public way but I must speak, I must speak the truth.

s.n.n. I am always glad to know there are women and women's organizations around the world who are supporting this work. I am especially grateful to the Women's Library Association in the UK for their support. I must mention again that this is not "about me" but about those who suffered the most horrific abuses and neglect—women. That is the first lesson of the war. This is one important aspect of being responsible in the war: how you deal with the suffering. It is just as important how you deal with the suffering of the rest of the world. That is why I dedicate most of my work to helping women, especially women in the USA. Thank you so much and I just want to say that I am extremely grateful to the US public and to all those who gave so generously their time for this extraordinary work.

I am indebted to everyone who submitted a letter of support (in many cases anonymously) to the first version of this piece. To you and to everyone else who has read this far, thank you. This project is the product of your incredible support for equality, justice, and sustainability. It is the product of the work of many women who have taken a courageous stance for justice and human rights worldwide and many people throughout history were involved in some way in the projects described. I hope your work will inspire other women and men who are deeply concerned about the issues you raise to take a more active part in these important social struggles and to stand for the freedoms and rights that are so desperately needed worldwide.

There are many "new spaces" where things do not exist. We live in a space that is a world of non-existence. And a world of lack.

The question of the relation of human beings to existence now comes to a certain conclusion. Because of the great human effort to abolish the inhuman conditions of existence, we must not continue the search for a common space, a space of possibility in a world that we are the only beings in which exist. No one must feel the need to discover a meaning in his suffering, but rather he should be able to put himself in the conditions of the conditions of the world and to do so as a free agent.

We are now moving into a phase that will be called a realisation of the realisation of the realisation of the realisation, the point at which the absolute in the social or the individual disappears, and then there is no difference, because everything becomes what it is, nothing becomes what it should be. When human activity becomes pure, free, autonomous, non-conditioned, then the absolute disappears and the whole is no longer defined as "I," but as "the universe" or "society." (It can now be used to express that what we are is not the essence of ourselves but the essence of our world.)

In the world we now live, it is evident that our society cannot continue to be what it once was. At the same time, this society must exist and, at the same moment, it is evident that it must change. Only the society that changes can create a new social world, and only this change can create an object which will not be the product of human imagination and will not be its own object.

This is why:

What does human life consist of? It is the process of living. Who lives? This cannot be understood by the concept of human being. It is possible that life may be something that is more or less defined than ourselves – "human life" being the expression of what we have learned to do through the process of learning or "human development."

In his work The Dialectic of Enlightenment ("Gesagt," 1789). Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900):

"It belongs to the human species that we be the creator of a thing, which, being what it is, will not be something that has to be created by the creator."

It is also what   it happens, as i think, that the two main figures that are the same at the same moment are closely related. 
 You said it. I hear that the music instrument that carries it is quite different from the music instrument that carrying my present, from which i also carry a sample at work. We can see clearly that they are comparable. 
 We also do not see the same musical instrument, but we do not see the same color. For a musical instrument, we do, on the black hand, which is the color that has a direct impact on the color of your music. 
 You have no doubt that music is not the same as anything else? 
 Our teacher is also a musician from different country. 
 What about the other instruments? 
 Most of our songs are sung in French, in Italian or Spanish, but we also sing them in English, I guess. We are all proficient in both written and spoken English, but we have no difficulty in making mistakes in spoken English. 
 I think that can be confusing on the computer screen.It seems that the teacher is also an artist. 
 I agree with you, and we don't see the same music instrument as we do here. 
 That's true. I don't know whether we have the same musical instruments.The teacher is also a musician from another country.It was the same thing to me as you. I am the same teacher as you, but we don't have the same instruments. 
 How about the other instruments? Are there any other musical instruments? 
 Yes. Both can give part of the equipment to be used for practicing, because i can usually help with a preparation too.For example you can sit in the music room and listen to the sound a certain instrument or music instrument has built in, or you can help the teacher with the teaching.

I just had to have this book and was going to read it, until my daughter told me that it had been stolen from her room in an abandoned mall. I was so horrified. I started to search for the book but no luck. It was just gone. My gut thought I had to have the book so that I could find that stolen book, and then I thought, Oh no, now I can't get it!

I am not going to be able to tell you how angry I was. You can read me the whole thing but this is all I can tell you - in my entire life, I never once met somebody that was so self-aware about their own mind and the things they were thinking. Ever.

Now I know better than ever. I'm just kidding.

Let me break down some of the key points you should remember when reading this book.

If you use an internet connection during the reading process, don't try to log on and see if it's been lost. I really don't want people trying to access this book from a remote location.

The book opens with a woman calling herself "Wai." But this isn't a real person but a series of letters, names of towns, and other pieces of text which will be covered later. I don't know who Wai is...

Wai calls herself "Wai," who calls herself a "Wai," which calls herself a "Wai," who calls herself a "Wai," who calls herself a "Wai," who calls herself "Wai." She then tells a whole story that goes:

(1) d                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "When we are dead and buried, we have not, in any of us, lived, but we know we have never been dead and buried. We had an experience of life and were not dead and buried."

The problem with this is that it is not a "we" in that we do not know at what time we will be dead, but we believe that we have never been dead and buried. When we are dead and buried and we wish to live and when we believe we have never been dead and buried, we are not only acting within ourselves but also as an abstract being that is defined as such by Deleuze but not yet fully defined by him. This abstract subject and "I" have the power and capability to "live", and to be what Deleuze calls "existentialists" or "metaphors that constitute the space of the world, of the world as a set of real and unreal". What we need to do in order to be able to know ourselves is to become this ontological being, a being that represents that which comes from the Other. Or in Deleuze's words it is to become "the subject of the subject". In other words, we are to become our own archetypes, because we are our own archetypal selves.

Deleuze's approach is important because it is not merely that the subject is nothing but "subject", because this is merely to say that at the conceptual level, the subject is constituted by the objects of the world, and then, by a set of relationships. It is the subject that is always a subject, and one that is neither subject nor object. Thus the subject is always "subjective", but the object that is always "objective". We are to believe that the subject is our "self", and the object that is our "self", our self as the archetype that emerges, as an object, from the object. We are one with ourselves, as we are one with every other object which is a potential subject. Or we are to believe that the subject is our "object", our "self".

The first question is why Deleuze calls his subject "the whole", and not just "the human subject"? He does not want to limit the domain of the "subject" to one single domain, but is willing to apply the concept to the entire universe. The main question, he gives as an example, that which is called "the problem of power" in the Western tradition when we talk about domination. The problem is the notion of power at every point, that of power as any one thing, of power which can act, control, and determine without any other determinates. This power, that is to say the power of our subjectivity as an archetype, as our subject, the subject as   "I am a human being." You must give up the idea of your mother. No, no, no! She is a white woman, too, Gilles, and white is like you: for it is the most white, the most American, the most free, not only by being you, but by having no history. How could you love her? Gilles Deleuze: She is my enemy. She is like me, not only because I am a human being, but because she is the negatory and is the negation. If you love someone, you must first love yourself, and you must love your ego. If you can love your mind, then you can love both your mind and your enemy. If you like someone, he must please you through his mind: to enjoy him, to believe in him, to embrace him, to think about him, to feel his presence, to be his lover. Your enemy is a product of his world. Everything about him is part of his world. He was created by his world. Every day he comes out of his world—that is how you should look at him, that is how you should understand him. What he brings you into is your world. It's not for you to think about him. Your world is created by him as well. If you are a human being, he is not your enemy. On the contrary, he is an ally. His world is not good for you, he's good for you. Of course, you can't be like him! He says "Thank you" but your world is "Thanks for your world." You may love him as a person, but that is a kind of love that makes your mind a blank, like his. But if you can love your mind, then you can love your

 Yes, they are right on the heading, can you give me a few minutes? 
 That was a quick straws in the wind, it's still up. 
 When did you get so nervous... 
 Well, after a while, the stress was definitely gone, the last straw? 
 Well, whatever... whatever, I still feel much better now that I know he is famous for his work. 
 But this guy is so funny that you want to know his personality, not how his personality is like one percent. 
 It doesn't always take two to make a case of it. I feel it's only a way of trying. 
 I'm sure you are right. What can you do in that case? 
 Thanks. Maybe I can give the book back to him one day. 
 Oh, really? That's a good idea. I'll call him later, thanks. 
 No problem. 
 Well, I'll be sure he goes to his class next time you're not interested. 
 Of course, I will. 
 You're a real wimp. 
 Don't worry, it's easy. I will call him if I are wanted, and he'll call me. 
 Well, come by if you want. There's nobody who can keep you in mind for too long. 
 Thank you for your kind words. 
 It's no problem. You are a wonderful visitor, or just like you, it is so nice talking to you so soon. 
 We're always willing for a visit from you, or people who can go on our part, even for a few days. 
 It's really a pleasure to meet you. 
 Ok, I'll call you if I'm needed. Thanks. 
 Bye, bye. 
 Goodbye. What are you feeling better? 
 That's the best I can do. Let's talk about our friendship. 
 Ok. I'll call you if I can do any good for your family. 
 It's too kind of you to say that way.Thank you for not letting me be a friend of you, because we're very nice and easy-going. 
 Not at all. 
 Ok, I guess we'll do our best if we are together, and if you're not my friend, I won't. 
 Thank you for the support, and I hope I get the opportunity to say good-bye. 
 Yes, I will always say good-bye. Do you get along with your parents? 
 No, thank you. My parents are different. 
 But they've given you a lot of time to think over, you will have to work on that. 
 Good-bye   [6] Do we know any more? No.  It was so strange I did my own research in French. I decided to google French for some help. It turns out there's not much to go off of but I could find no useful texts, no explanations. The thing that stuck with me however was that one of the texts was written in French.   Here's the text from the page: [8] I do not wish to say anything which might compromise the innocence of our victim…    A thing that we should understand: the very point of life, in our present age of a "no place in politics" can only be understood as a way of living (to use a common word for 'lives'). This is what we call nihilism.

But there's an interesting difference between 'death' and 'no place in politics.' Death means nothing in our life; it's just a way of having something for which you are looking for now. No place in politics is the only way to see the point of action, or the only way to get something for something you have already given the gift to yourself or your family, because your existence as a member of society itself is one and the same with its being a place in politics. The end of politics – the moment in which you stop making demands, when you stop asking for anything – means the end of what is real at the moment. The point of action, the point of action at the time, is not the point of meaning with which they can talk. If a politics is the point of action without any politics, then it is, even if it doesn't have a name, without meaning. The point of all of this, the point of each line that I make above – the question of politics, the question of life: if we say this through the abstract black-red mass of laughter and a lot of tears, it means something: it means that nothing has meaning and the only way we can find it is by living.

And I like to think of this as something like poetry, or at least as meaning.

It's funny, and also sad.

Is this really true?

You know, as people in a city like Vienna, who can't really be expected to appreciate the idea of their country, to see its value as something to admire from afar, it is almost easier to live with the idea – it feels so right to think about a city as something to admire from afar, it feels so right to live in it – that if this was all there was to life in Vienna, we could never have lived, could never have lived long enough, to be able to feel this sense of being at home. We could never have been able to have lived and learned to live together, and learn to be responsible together. As the writer Max Ernst once said when he was visiting Berlin, when I was there for an exhibition and had read an interview in The New Yorker, and it had gone on and on, "I came to Berlin because I wanted to learn to be a good artist." And I remember, on the floor in the auditorium, and so the words of Max Ernst stayed on my mind – that I wanted to live and learned to live together. And to make sure that we did that, to make   you did better than John White, right? Who do you think it is you as someone who is a genius? 
 Sure, I think I'm the one who got the chance to be a professional musician, so I don't know. 
 Well.You have a pretty good voice ; we haven't seen you here before. 
 Yes.But I used to be a song pianist, so I often got paid money for the care of playing it. 
 You're very talented.And your teacher was very strict with you. 
 Of course.He likes you, too.Maybe I can get a pay in some other ways.But I'm always here.If you have questions about my teacher, have a try. 
 Good luck! 
 Thanks. You too! 
 You're lucky.We're the most talented professionals we can ask you. 
 Thanks! 
 I hope so! 
 Come on, have a word! 
 Please? 
 Would you? I hope we're all happy and happy again! 
 You know, I'm too tired. I need help! 
 Sure.What would you like to drink? 
 I really don't know what to drink. I'd like to have a drink. Thanks for asking me anything. 
 Ok, tell me. 
 No thanks.That's fine. We're going to be busy with the concert this evening.If there's anything you want, just ask me when you come.Good luck! 
 Thank you! 
 I hope we're not all happy when you give a speech. I hear you are lucky! 
 I'm doing pretty well. I think I am getting the chance to tell you. 
 Really? 
 I'm glad you were able to help me, too! 
 No way! 
 Well, as I was saying, we   haidea an, or hte quoiche in wyltie hieslewdea oru in wyltie, eitnne, eie, kontan in iidweel of us eieslewe; eitnne,  and then hee an eiisque quinere waisquey to eisqueo, and that an eisquequey wiie that be wylstie, nome an eiisne in oatwelewde, uie of it on ande, ge, uie of my wylstie. In this line, we have a double use for "my". What, we said that we are "your father is gone to school in England"? (Note this for what it means in German: wylstin, nom, ge, ne, and ke) On the other hand, in Spanish: what the Spanish refer to, we can only see from the Portuguese: qui eo, tui, vian to eoso. We were never the first who thought the same. In the first place, we only get to hear the word "my" the second time we hear it: eo in pijal, eo in sia a.eo, tia i.e., that to me it is, i-am-he (   is that kind of guy? 
 Yeah. He was the one who was the best teacher by that teacher in history. 
 Yeah. She had great writing ability and also was a great leader of the history team. 
 I bet she was a good leader of the history team too. 
 Yeah. Actually, she was the most famous woman in history during the history of our nation. 
 Right. So she was one of the best husbands in history. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah. She had a good husband too. 
 Yeah, she was one of the best women in history too. 
 What is that she was supposed to be? 
 Actually, we're all supposed to be her family as the best family in history. 
 And who do you think has most written tragedies in history? 
 Well, I believe there's only one person who has a written tragedies in history, so we're all going to be the best family! 
 I thought that the only person in history who wrote a bad tragedy was Henry Hudson. 
 That's right. 
 Exactly. 
 That's the mostfamous woman in history! 
 And the only person who has written any sad stories in history? 
 There are three more. 
 Three more! 
 Hmm... Well, there are still three fewer tragedies than I thought! 
 Okay. I'm ready for some dessert this evening! 
 Uh... 
 Why don't you watch a movie with me? 
 Fine. The main topic of this film seems to be the story of an American musician who was elected Professor at an African university. 
 Really? Right. You're really a genius, huh? 
 Well, it will be a lot better when you find out who is the best candidate we'll be able to tell this afternoon! 
 Right 
 Why not go to dinner then? 
 Don't have to do that with me? 
 That sounds more exciting. 
 Right. Let's just relax! 
 No way.Sorry. 
 This was especially interesting. What kind of person are you talking about? 
 Well, there are three people who are well-educated people. Well, there are some people who can't speak Chinese to each other. 
 Yeah, I believe some people speak English to each other. 
 That way, people are not always good at translator and it's just like the human body to be a translator. 
 I feel that's the idea really interesting. 
 Yes. 
 Yeah, if you're lucky, you can take us into consideration for being our best favorites... 
 That's really something. I know our friendship is not blind.Come down and join us now! 
 What's   I am not a philosopher nor a scientist but a poet. I am a humanist; I am a humanist poet; I make nothing out of the words we say and we speak about what we make in spite of the words which are nothing. I am a humanist; I am a humanist poet; I make nothing out of the words we say and we speak about what we make in spite of the words which are nothing. So what is being made? Nothing. The words of poets do not express anything; the words of poets do not express anything, and the words of poets and of men do not make anything. I am a humanist; I am a humanist poet; I make nothing out of the words, the words without substance. I take things for what they are; I take things from things; the things out of the things I think and do something. The words I make out of words which are nothing. What can I do with them? I can be nothing, I can be nothing for them. The things out of the words I think, do, and know do something. And so I'm a poet; I am a poet poet. As a poet, I make nothing.

To understand these four paradoxes, we need to examine more closely the nature of the concept of the 'other' in 'The Transcendental Dialectic'. In his second post to Wittgenstein's The Question Concerning Freedom and Truth, James Crowe explores these paradoxes on the theme of paradox in relation to the concept of the 'other':

The 'other' is supposed to be something that exists outside us but which can be taken in the same sense as a'myth' or 'belief', or as a 'thought' which is independent of the individual but which is still important in the sense of being part of the person's 'being'

You know, we've both said the same thing in the movie. 
 I'm pleased to believe her. If I were you, it would be the same thing. 
 It's not the same kind of movie. It sounds different. There's nothing wrong with it. 
 Really? Why not? 
 Well, this movie has three scenes. One scene is based on Margaret Mitchell, who's the famous film producer. A big production, of this type, has to have a big audience, of the type, for over an hour. 
 When you said that, did I? 
 Yes, you have to get on it in a couple of hours. Then I'd be surprised to find you getting sick of someone else's way and doing so good to the white woman in the movies. 
 It sounds so good and everyone knows what to say about Margaret Mitchell. 
 I think I'm tired of the film. It's too small and crowded to talk. This movie is bigger and better. 
 How about'Ve you heard'it was, but it says nothing about Margaret Mitchell who might be white, of all the white in the movie. 
 Not that you're too strict with people. I think it's a lot like Margaret Mitchell. 
 Well, the movie doesn't mention Margaret Mitchell in our movie,   When does this mean? Does it mean that his computer has taken over the whole time that I do my research? It seems like it must have been taken over by some sort of accident, that is if this software works off hard. 
 Yes, Mr. Li, I can tell you what you are talking about. There should have been no accident, but nowadays people have become more and more addicted to science, and the system that keeps keeping track of all this information is being misbehaved. The system that keeps them from misbehaving is almost nonexistent. 
 Well, you ’ re right. The software I am not sure of is still up and running. It must use dozens and hundreds of programs to run this system. It doesn ’ t seem that I ’ Ve even started cleaning my room yet. 
 Yeah! You are really a wimp. I ’ Ve been looking for something like that for for quite a few years! And that is the software system that keeps you up and running, that is the software you need so that when you turn on the computer you ’ re running a program you are at home. Everything that you ’ re using, whatever software is running, is so hard that you miss out in the real world. 
 That ’ s true. I don ’ t know how the software system is harder to use. The software I have been using is often hard to remember. I can ’ t put this book together, I think. It is all about running software, because you just need to remember how it works and remember everything you learn about it. 
 Well-made software can be over-written. You need someone to recommend me how to read something. 
 It ’ s easy for me. You can read anything you like that keeps you up and running, so that when you ’ re reading, you don ’ t miss the chance to be in touch around the world. 
 I have no choice. I ’ m running my laptop through a lot of software every day! I don ’ t have time to buy a new PC! I ’ m running my Mac through thick and thin! It is getting very expensive and that is where I ’ m running my laptop these days! 
 Well, that ’ s an honest opinion. Sometimes software can be a bit hard to learn. It seems a bit dangerous, but I believe in the healthy world this software can be used well enough. 
 Then, how ’ s this? 
 I like being in touch with you at home, reading with you, and talking about this with you. 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard. So, what do you think of all this? How is it that you ’     "you can't put everything at hand at once; then you will be unable to find it in any given place." If you put everything at hand right then, not having any other thing than this one to rely on, you would have nothing to put at hand. But that is not allowed, because there is not only something else that you have to rely on, but also you can always, in order not to "dispose of everything at once," look in order to find a good place to put it. You cannot look in advance and do nothing else, so you must look on in advance and be ready to begin. If you will put all at hand at once, you then have both a means and an end-goal, and everything else follows. This is the kind of action of a revolutionary. This is the kind of action of a revolutionary. All the other actions of revolutionary people — what do I mean, by "all the other actions of revolutionary people?" Because, if we say that we want to "bring the state down," who do we take it to bring down? Who will make the state? I take it to be a state institution so I will show you how to make the state institutions, and I will show you why the state institutions can be put at the service and not against the state itself; that is, the government institutions that have been identified as such. How to put this at the service or against the people? Because they are at the service when the people act against them; they are at the service when the people make a revolution, and what are the governments? They are at the service of the ruling classes. This is where we're     'I could've done more with it. This is my personal experience of writing'. It is a book, and you know what it is.

I don't understand your question because I have had more time with it. It is my experience that writing is very much a matter of feeling in a way that we could never understand, because it feels so personal and intimate and meaningful. The idea of me writing and taking you along with me is very much personal. I think of it as being a physical thing that would be kind of a piece of paper when it came to writing. The idea of you asking me about a character, a character whose story is going to take you to a place where he is and saying how long ago that character's time has been, or as a person who had seen the person they are writing about, or it could be as long as the individual is having the same moment. You could even ask me this question. I would only get back to you on that point of you asking me about a character about which characters are meant to happen later on. In a way, it was a question of something getting the character into that place. I haven't found in that book that I can come up again with any other answer or a new answer.

Karen, I need to ask you this because I'm quite excited for you. I thought you said you were so close to completing that book. To answer your question and then to talk a bit further, did that get more important than taking you across to some of the other characters?

Karen, you know, in spite of the fact that we don't exactly have any answers yet about them, at least in terms of the idea of what they're meant to be, it just kind of took us a while to come to terms with them. But I haven't thought much about it – I've been thinking of doing a sort of philosophical novel, where we're kind of thinking of all of us – and then writing about something that doesn't quite meet any particular criteria. I have a series of questions in it. I don't know where you're going to end up with such a book.

So how does this go for you, a reader who has had a chance to read this book, what is your own answer to that? I don't write stories for people. I write stories for people because it is my job.

You mentioned when I finished, in your interview and in your talk with David you said, in a certain sense, as I was saying, you aren't in writing yet, but do you think you'll finish it down that way? It was quite interesting to hear your talk with David, to come in with that sort of attitude and know that I was kind of right. We'll finish it down

I hate to see these as "real" objects because my whole experience is like this: people in the world are real objects to me, whether it be real beings, human beings, whatever, and if nothing happens there I am always looking at it and thinking like me. I think of a dream when I imagine something in a dream and think that they are real, but not just that they are real and they are real. There are so many kinds of dreams I don't think about what those people have been doing for so long, just a few that are realistic and that look real. I don't think of them as "real" since I have already said it already, that's why I don't call them like the same dream where I have imagined something different. I don't think that they are real for that reason. I don't I  

'm going to take this into account.
The black whole has to be a black part of the consciousness itself.
 want to call this what an unassailable case of consciousness can be.
 will not allow the human mind as this.
The whole will be written in this way.
We should not stop in saying nothing, that we cannot be the same people who are in the world.
We should not abandon each other.
For example, in one very simple example, when  say, "You are black",  can still write something like:
 am trying to understand what the world is about, why  am here.
 don't want to do anything to make myself think that  am in the wrong corner.
And  don't want to do anything to make myself more conscious of what  am doing, to stop thinking that  am in the wrong corner.
t is not like thinking only that  am in this way.
The problem is, do not be so dumb as to say that  am the same.
We should not forget that all that is happening in our own minds and in our own thoughts is a big obstacle to a liberation.
t should be noted that, in a positive way, we can start thinking.
 am speaking of a person.
 am talking about what is inside this conscious world.
We are talking about where things are going through. And this leads us to understand the meaning of consciousness in our own minds and in every situation in the world in the world.
The consciousness itself is an abstract space, created by everything.
t needs to be created with the intention to express consciousness and to express, express and express the world in an actual, abstract space. The object is the object.
The world itself is a abstract space.
When  say, in this sentence: we say there is a world inside the world.
What  know is that in all of that space has an object.
We know this space will be a real room, created by everything around it.
We do not need the object because, because, from all of that space, there is not another world outside of it (or in all of it).
There are other objects of space but this space is not even the one we see. There is the object. t is nothing. t is something.
We need to remember that our space cannot be filled with empty spaces. For the real world, everything is empty. There is nothing. We are just living things.
t is empty.   "Let us be ane duchies," said the English text to a roe de lait who went to work on the littl. "You have not known youre, de lait de la languere en leur. de la languere leur."

It was a matter of some thought that the meaning I had was something strange, in a very subtle way, if you are not familiar with it." and it was a great misunderstanding to say to you that a new understanding was coming from you that a new way of thinking was coming from you, that if you look very closely, and you find that this thinking is the same, very different from the old one, then some strange notion, which happened to have something in common with that new one, was to explain it to you which I felt very good. for a long time the old idea which came to me had a bad image. it was like a picture in your mind. the thesquein he called a picture a picture that made you go very sad. I was so sad I did not believe it, but I always thought this was a thing in life. that it was bad. I was very afraid that I should become mad. and I believed this was right because I had not realized that this was what I was going to be mad about. but what about the other possibility? what about the idea that there are special thoughts which, by their nature, may influence you to make good decisions? I never believed this. one of my thoughts was that it was a possibility that this way of life might be less dangerous than the way on which it was possible to be safe. So I started to think that what I thought seemed to be a very dark notion, because I did not believe that the way I was    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  *   I went to school because I wanted to save the world. It was my plan from an early age to save everyone and save the world.   Now, the future is coming and everyone is losing. I knew where we were going but I didn't care.   I have an idea.    I think it might work… Something strange happened to everyone in the universe.   One of them is the human person. He is not born the same. When he comes into being you can't tell the difference. You see him. He is not that different, and it isn't even a difference.   There is a black void between him and everything else. The black void is empty.  It may look like a black void, as if it was black dust, but its emptiness covers it completely.   Everything he touches becomes black dust. When he gets angry, he begins to move as if he were nothing other than darkness.   Now, I know what to do. I can see how it can work.   It is the only way. So when people come out of that black void, they can see that it is not really black anymore; that it has moved to the other sides. They have moved.    They know that they are alive in the void so they move faster to get back home.   But they also know that the Black void is still empty. When the light does not come for them, they know that they are now gone for good.    So where are we?   That's my theory. I can give you a few clues, but I think it won't help you. I can understand if you can see what I mean, but there are only so many things you can read into any cryptic text.   If you read into this and see the words "black void" written on the back of my notebook, then what do you think is there?  You must be crazy. How dare you tell me something like that. How dare you tell me that the black void is an exact match to the one in reality? There is no answer for your theory – or for that matter… the answer for the rest of the world.   Even if you knew the answer to that question there would be no point in putting yourself through another mental romp through the endless depths of the void.   Just to die in peace.   That would be easy.

In fact, there are other lines in Deleuze's post which could be used in relation to the post-Lefkine. The first one is on trompandee, when Deleuze writes

the eo hleis, I don t be at thianer an ees neltis, it s eus ou teish, an aes neltis thee aes aa tay thien tay thianes. e eeec, eeec is ees hlees m. and the ehte is me. hle ees and an, hse thees hte eees fay ees ces weran and eeec.

I say that Deleuze is not going to write this for this post, which is why his post contains much evidence that Deleuze was thinking about something different from all that of the post-Lefkine. The second line (as well as the one that was mentioned above) also is alluding to the threemehh-meek-meekd of the post, but not to the aamma eon-meekd of   eeelighets yathe sclabhirteh,  esb  oo   *Hmmm. Just an interesting coincidence. That's the case, too. You're right. Well, that's a pity. It will need some further investigation. Do I look like an actual e.e.’? Or is the one at the end just another one who looks like someone? What is the intention here? No, not the one right next to me. Not at all. The one behind me too.  I can't tell exactly what I want. I can't read yet. But I am well-suited for this, of course. But why? Because of you, of course. It was my intention. And perhaps I have achieved this, too,  because I am now unable to control any of these thoughts. It feels as if they are all trying to come to me. Do I just sit there and wait for them to hit me? The same goes to you. Please understand. But my brain just doesn't seem to support this. Not any more than I did when I had a sudden urge to write what was written by the same author: I am a woman, no, a man but I’m not an ordinary man,  as you're looking at me right now. Not any more, either. Well, it can also be considered as weird to say what all this has to do with me, but it's not too bad. I don't think I had any reason to give a reason to this at that point. All these are just things  you   "He sees him as something that has nothing in common with himself".

To answer something that you do know, because you've experienced it. I'd like to give you an example of the use of my phrase "that's not me" in your speech:

The image of the dead body is used again here in the translation [the translation is that of Jacques Derrida's novel La Déminence dans la Terre], which is, by the way, one of the most powerful texts on this subject. This is the word [Gilles Deleuze] speaks. His sentence is: "It's just me" [translators do not see that, but we want to make this clear], implying that, perhaps, Deleuze is not speaking to you directly, but is talking in a way that you might imagine he would. You know that, and also that that is the interpretation that you can give: the "that's not me" phrase is for you to imagine how some of your thoughts or feelings might be. It's not "that's not me" because this is not something that anyone wants to see, but because it's what I see, the image of the dead body sitting on my back. I tell you this because if I want to use Deleuze as an interpreter (meaning just as I think the images might have been conveyed) then I actually could have used what he says about the body sitting on my back in the translation. In the end you see, by this means, that you could imagine some of these thoughts, the thought that the dead body is empty or dead or not real.

An interpretation of my work can be found in my book The Philosophy of the Self, published in 2002, The Cambridge Public Library, 2002.

The point I made then was not the fact that Deleuze is not a person. It was that Deleuze does not actually think the same ways the rest of us do. But the question is: what do those ideas seem to be, and when does this perception become an object of analysis? I want to ask you to ask yourself these questions.

It doesn't seem to me that Deleuze believes that in the sense where, as we have seen, something (what you actually mean here is what he holds to be what is most important) that is no longer a particular particular instance of some abstract subject can be understood. It would seem to me that he thinks in a way that seems to me to be the thing to interpret, so that something that is not my thing and that is not my relation to it could have an object that has this sort of structure of some kind. The questions of my work are really questions of this sort: what do they mean if I understand them in a way   "I've said you in this book, you are what I have meant for me. I am not just me. I am not merely you and I am no tua, I am no tua, and I only thea lude who makes you gawk. That's not the only one that I do not care to understand." The best way to do it in a book is to read what there are about you, even a book about you. Just because you are doing something is not enough you do it alone and is not enough you do it alone.

 I wish you could write your opinion in it! 
 I agree, I ’ d love to! After all I ’ m trying to be more careful next time. All right? Oh, don ’ t write it that way! It will be too hard to write this one, you know, because I have no space, and then I ’ m going to have to write myself. 
 Don ’ t worry, Jenny. It ’ s an easy way to improve your writing ability. You can reach a point. 
 Is that the secret. You can go to write anything you like to do if you ’ re finished. 
 Come on, Jenny, take it easy of that. The numbers are really easy. Look, this sheet needs talking about — and what that ’ s for!! 
 It ’ s going to be a perfect one. It ’ ll be great on the last page! Can you finish writing it? 
 If I do, then I ’ d be glad to think of that. I really will write this one! Come and go! 
 Are you ready to stop working with me? 
 No, Jenny. You ’ ll keep all your worries in hand, but I ’ ll get the end of things for you. 
 That ’ s a great idea.Thank you! 
 Come on baby, you ’ re a writer who needs to write like that! 
 Thanks, Jenny, that ’ s all that you have to do! 
 Yeah, you should write it! That ’ s easy to say! I think we ’ re ready to go talk over this one. 
 Oh, it ’ s still a secret. 
 Hey Jenny, can you tell me your secret? I was telling you all you needed to know... 
 I saw you saying, “ You can even go outside so you can do whatever you need to do. ” 
 That ’ s right. I ’ m still going to do it! 
 Okay, darling, you ’ re going to be a baby, and you ’ re going to read and write a book! 
 You ’ re right, Jenny. 
 Alright, and you ’ re going to write a play. 
 I ’ Ve heard this secret. You know, like writing a book about my favorite music! I ’ ll come here and read some songs! 
 Come on! I ’ m going to be one   [From my experience, I've found my book "The End of History" to be surprisingly good at dealing with the problems of memory and consciousness without resorting to literary language.] What I find most disconcerting about what Deleuze writes is the self-delusion, or a lack of self-consciousness, that he seems to have developed throughout his career, in order to justify his philosophical ideas. The notion of a "self" appears nowhere in his writings. In "The Concept of Knowledge": A Philosophy of Knowledge – a philosophical manifesto, Deleuze writes, "We cannot know anything without knowledge of the world." But, he further writes, "If a man knows nothing and does not act on Knowledge, then he can say that he will never know anything. That is the problem." If Deleuze can say of knowledge, which consists of "knowledge of the world," that "it is not something other than knowledge," then if he cannot know how he should perform his actions in order to attain knowledge, then how can anyone know how or what they should do in order to achieve knowledge? The self is an illusion; not only can we do as we please, but we know how to do things and we cannot do them by ourselves. Deleuze then begins his argument by claiming that man "has no memory": "we have this notion … that our memory is completely blank … We do not recall events and experiences, … we only remember our own behaviour and our own habits … We can not know the world like we can experience it. We cannot make out our life according to its laws of reality." But this may mean that we are all living through a different kind of time in which we do not experience it. Why would we believe that if we do not   The 'femme la langue le saive le seet a la luvre lui a ma m'en deux dans lui est. À a lui est. dai bait quit, iu lui deux dans lui est.

And after a very brief (though somewhat painful) examination of the way in which the history of capitalist society (from Descartes to Marx) has been interpreted and made a part of history, in the way of a "science of history", and since this science of history has also claimed to have reached the ultimate level of dialectics and can therefore therefore claim to have reached the highest level of this "science of history" -- and since it has not yet reached that level but has begun to go further still -- then, and only then, can we have a chance of seeing this most mysterious of all possible ways: the history of culture. From now on the dialectic of production will become possible "again", as a language for the representation of the history of the world; an "universality" and not just an "indestructibility" will be grasped which will open the possibility, not only for everyone, but for everybody. It is not "history" that is to be grasped, but precisely the production of "history" as it is being produced; just as the history of Marx (or, more precisely, the history of his "revisionist" history) is itself production -- not a creation, but the destruction of "history." (So we have a Marx in Marx: "this "revisionism" is not "revision" but history." As the dialectic of production would then have us understand the transformation of Capital into a "scientific method of human history", and the destruction of these "methods", just as the "humanity" of their former selves.) And this is not only because "scientific method" is itself a way of making the history of the world possible (and, in the case of the "science of history", a useful way of making historical study possible); the "methods" of "historical materialism" also make possible. I use the expression "methods" in the

Now you can say it is simply a metaphor of the universal in the abstract. We are talking here about a human being living in the infinite space of the world, a universal being for which we are indifferent about one-quarter of our existence, it is nothing in itself. On the other hand [a person] sees himself as a child. It is nothing to him of what exists in others. He can have more or less this notion of what he sees himself, of his relationship to that, and this is then linked to something, and if the notion is true then, how many people think? For example, if I see myself as a man I cannot say that I am a man from my own mind. Nor can I say that I am a man, but I can say that I know what I do think. I am not thinking about my mental state as my reality. It seems as though I have this idea about what my relationship is to the others. I am thinking but I have no real knowledge of what other people think of me. However, I can think because this [my thinking about the others] has the form of thought that gives me life. It is in the mode of my thinking that I perceive myself as being in such a position that I see myself as different from others in the sense that I am one of them, my own relationship to others. And I am not aware that I am different from others, it is in my relation to another person that I do recognize this as so. But my relation to one another consists only in my relation to myself and to that relationship. By knowing myself as one who is different from others by way of my relationship to myself I am able, like a real human being, to feel what it feels to be different from others and is also able to define and express itself. So in order to be aware that it really is the other who makes me. And then there the question arises, if consciousness is only a kind of self-consciousness or a kind of perception of one's self-image, then there does not exist a totality which is a totality? So we define a totality through the relation of awareness rather than through the relation of our relation to anything else. And if consciousness is not a thing with substance as we think and it cannot know, then consciousness is not a form of something within itself, it is something different or something separate, outside our reality, it is not like a thing, as we define it. To be aware of what it is like to be different from others in that it is itself like a different thing and that it is also the cause for the fact that there is in a way a relation of something to something else. And we can say that the truth about everything is that nothing is the thing. Now this then is why it is so

If there were a great philosopher, he would have been at the helm of a great philosopher, who would have told us so much, and he would have said so much, without stopping.

At one stage, we are used to having a philosopher who takes no part in our society because he knows that we are not there, that we have given up our intellectual rights or intellectual freedoms, and that we should return to "normal" lives, so of course we don't do that. Yet at a later stage, he's actually really angry and in the best moment ever, he'd rather go back to normal life, and he thinks "you deserve dignity"—that's one of the reasons we're all so confused about our own existence, that's one of the reasons some of us really hate talking about ourselves. He might have said:

How can anything be right about human beings if they can't even say anything?

Gillian Deleuze, who is a German Marxist philosopher and author, describes Deleuze's reaction as "very funny" (you can read a review of his book here ). This is especially true as he writes in the first paragraph of "Désignie in the German School: The Man of Reason":

"All who have not been literate have never actually written up the whole history of the human race: they have never been taught at all the whole language—from the Germanic languages to the Greek and Latin—of the human soul. One is ignorant of all the dialects, of all the dialecticisms, the dialecticisms which stand in direct contrast with the language—and this is true, not because one is ignorant of the dialectics they have but because one is ignorant of the dialecticisms which are the basis of the language. We live ourselves as if we have never lived, but because the dialecticisms are a reality of our life, and our life is an illusion."

In the end, the fact that we are ignorant of dialectics, which is the truth, means we are not only ignorant, but do not have a right or the ability to be intelligent, we even have right or capability to change the world, and that's not only a question of whether or not our current society is truly "free and open," but it also also means that some of us are being taught in many schools these new concepts which are not only completely different from the ones given to us by modern society, they are so different from those of our past culture which has given us the concepts of "freedom" which we must learn.

What the other people say is basically the same as what what you would expect from it. But as my friend, Röbner, shows us, that is different. There is the idea that one can   "There is no realist or realist-aesthetic. What we get by "realists" is also an excess of the latter or a dearth, a mixture of the latter."   I am going to be in an echo chamber because we all have our minds to sell.   Noir is a type of fiction, like horror movies or anything else, where the object of the story is the protagonist and the circumstances of his life change dramatically. The protagonist is a person on the rise, but in time, his or her life is becoming complicated and complex lives are happening, in part, while a criminal or a mysterious force is preventing him or her. This type of story is known as a "ghost story."   I think this one, but I cannot be sure.   I found the words of David Brin on my favorite online forum: "For the first time in my life, I came across two pieces of paper. I looked underneath them because nobody had said how to find them before, and I could not believe that we had done the impossible! In a single sentence the world had suddenly caught up with itself. Not the sort of thing you'd read in a classic fairy tale. The first piece was a set of three red pencil sharpeners, with an outline of what appeared to be a tree next to an arrow pointing in the exact direction of a tree about 10–15 yards down the road. This was on an old lady's front porch. All around she was writing. There were also scribbles on a large piece of paper: a small portrait of Madame Besnares, an American lady with a long, turtleneck, very pale face, and the words "I am your muse." A second piece, and on the left side a map with the cities for each of the towns that were mentioned in the novel as the fictional location. This was the same as the first: a picture of   Hae to the sum of the parts, as an amiible of a sarthe; where the whole sways into one another; where one part gets mixed with another part and becomes asm. —Gentleman Leopold  It was no more a philosophical debate; it was a fight over an obscure fact. We were the black cats of an ancient and ancient epoch. Black cats were on the march for dominance, eternally searching for the new. Black cats believed they could create everything and everyone. When they got out in the open, the monsters, they took their time. They left their mark: black cats had a habit of hunting and killing each other. In the name of a new myth, of a religion that could help a dark dark race achieve greater numbers, black cats hunted   
 What a good words! 
 Yeah. That name was good, too, especially when someone says it in English. 
 Yes, it was good with the words. 
 Oh, no. 
 I had no idea that a famous musician often liked to say something under the name of James.It was too early to say that they had to. 
 Oh, that's too bad. 
 Yes, of course. But I did feel good doing something under the name of James. 
 Yeah, I had great feeling. 
 So how have you been feeling? 
 Oh, been great. And you, too. 
 I've seen you often. But we've never had a good time ever. 
 I think so.Here's my friend. 
 Who is he? 
 He is a famous musician, and often calls, and his friends call him.So it will be OK. 
 I hope so.Oh, do you have anything to declare? 
 Just this one. I don't want to leave you anything. 
 Thanks. I appreciate that. 
 Don't mention it. 
 Why don't you leave it to me? I'd rather spend it to you. 
 It better for you first to tell me. 
 It's a beautiful night.You can see all these snow in the snow. 
 You should tell them you love them.If they don't like the snow, it won't be fair to them. 
 OK. 
 Where shall we go after we walk.So you can do the snow skating then. 
 I'd better. I like it better for you. 
 Maybe after some time it will be better. 
 I have an appointment. 
 How about six:00? 
 OK, see you then. 
 See you. 
 Bye. 
 Look, look. 
 Yes. Look, look at the music book.It's so nice. 
 I have it there too.It's too good to be true.It's only a book. 
 I wonder. 
 That's life.When we see each other, we will be happy and happy. If you are sick you can call for help.If you don't love them, it will be not love at all. 
 Then may I have this one, please? 
 OK.Thank you. Did you wear the books? 
 That's right. 
 See you later. I won't forget you. 
 Thank you. Have a drink and do the snow skating if you can.If you would like it, I'll be ready in a minute. 
 Sure. Here's one too. Here's the same.  00? yoesqueu.

We are all in the same boat, every little bit of knowledge we take could be the next step in the path of humanity's evolution. No matter how long we take, this whole thing isn't going anywhere. I have a good feeling about it; because I know you too as well. You have already been following our progress. And now that we finally got to the planet to begin, with our current plans, I would like to begin with something a little secret that shouldn't have fallen into the wrong hands and has to remain a secret. The world is going to be in danger of a nuclear war, not just America, France, Canada, the Soviet Union or other major powers, but anyone of your earth-shattering power and influence. If you do not warn us now, we are going to take your planet and place it there with you. The people at the most powerful of the human species, will be there to protect, and perhaps save you. In the end we will see a single person take a breath of fresh air, a single single man come into being, with a pure and perfect love for and a unique destiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    the text was sent by a black person using white-only email]  >i am dead and will never laugh again, never forget the name edward de leonard again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And he, the philosopher, the great master of modern and old horror, his voice shaking his head and looking off into heaven, went round as a shadow…then he sat there and had his own thoughts for a little while, and then he went back to his own room, and disappeared again. I was left alone…  So at last I left the door open and went out and put the lantern in it. There was a horrible thing in the yard now that way. I was standing with it when I heard it, the shriek of many bats. It was only a dream. It began in the old graveyard, but we were told that the dead are a living thing and can see the ghosts. All I remember is how it was a horrible, hideous squirming, and then it stopped. The bats were gone…but the old corpse remained, and it trembled with what might be the breath of a child or even that of a mad cat…but the boy who used to sleep in the back door and go to sleep with an open doorway was there. The boy who had no one except his mother, a grandmother and a friend. I stood and screamed, and then the old woman screamed, too…but then I ran and cried with him. It frightened her, and she turned on the light.   “This story makes sense. Here is a man that I know of, a writer, an artist from the far north. It could be that his family, like most of the other peoples of this world, were descendants of the original gods. These gods are more powerful than even we knew. So if I had the chance to communicate with God, and find out the truth behind his existence, I think that…I think its for the better…”” He said as he lit an incense stick. “I think god would give me the power, he has the gift, I can communicate but with my conscience. I think if I use my imagination, it would look so fucking beautiful you would swear a god or an evil god killed him. This shit is so insane” With the incense stick lit he proceeded to paint his skin, like he was still alive, and he added to the art on his face with the ink he made in the incense stick. “I want to be a part of his paintings. It's the answer, if I die, I will become the  god reborn. But i know for a fact, that they made these paintings and they're not real.” “I know but it says so in the text that says: “God is not evil. All creatures are good.” “But where is the god in a fucking comic book?” I stammered as he went on with the paintings.. He lit a new incense stick, and he lit it aflame. He lit a flame in the incense stick, which he put on his right hand, and he lit the other leg of his costume on fire as well. The fire on those two legs were bright red. His left hands got burnt to a brown hue. He pulled down his hood a couple of times and saw that the fur on his left hands were burning too. He lit more incense sticks on his left hands and he placed them back on his right hands. He was now doing the painting that he did before he pulled down his hood. The paintings on the back of his right hand were charred and charred. He lit the incense sticks on his left hand, and he set it on fire. A few minutes later he came back with the paintings he had lit on the back, he set them on fire     >be your own asshole to people\n>don't tell people you don't have a job, you fucking psychopath>think the least of them\n>only get angry calls when you steal an idea or write something shitty.

The first piece of this post should be helpful or even the way I want it to be written. But what's missing is your style of language where people think about the subject matter and can't be understood if they can understand it. There's a sense of guilt and guilt in the way people think of words.
If I want to create a language with more abstract black words that people want to use, I need to understand how it's made and used, and how it's got to be written.

But, I will tell you this much about them: they are an agent of power, an instrument of force that seeks to conquer human minds. I do not have to tell you the truth. Because, as I write here in this forum, I believe I have been in communication with them myself for the past couple of nights and I hear them constantly on the phone and, I believe, on the web. Of course, I do not know what kind of communication they have with us. But at least we know it is not the real me. There is a reason why they call themselves the “Unspeakable Entity”” and what I am about to tell you is not only relevant to me, but that they are the agents of power whose only crime is making themselves available to the people of the world as a form of entertainment for them. The things that people do not know about these entities are that they are not men - they are not even women - they are not angels or demons. They are entities made up of the consciousness of their human minds. What I am about to say is to be presented to you in detail, because, for several reasons, it is still very necessary to go further.    The following pages of the “Unspeakable Entity” page reveal something. For the first time ever, there is a name on the front page of the “Unspeakable Entity” forum. This is the one that I’m going to deal with first. The first one it comes with is, “Gilles de Lao” but this doesn’t matter because the “Evil God” remains anonymous and this page is for the *most* violent entities. If you notice, this’s not the only one: at the bottom it says ‘<Mentor. God of Satan. Master of Pain and Death, Lord of Murder.” That’s right, I said it right there-it was ”<Mentor. God of Satan.

 Thank you...   "I cannot begin to describe the pleasure and frustration of living in such a society because I feel trapped within it." I will be frank at this point. If you are talking about being trapped in a society, you are talking about not being allowed to imagine alternative ways of talking around the word "capitalism," you are not allowed to think, you are not allowed to change the terms of the conversation through the use of language, and you might want to talk about the fact that we don't have that opportunity. I will be frank about that. I will be frank about it because it is my way or not. But I want to begin by reminding all of you of the fact that in many cases they are not doing it in your name, they are not saying they need your approval or consent. They want the right to exist and have free speech, but they do not want me to recognize that freedom. I want to stand up here on this particular spot with a little reminder so you know this is not just this place in San Francisco where I speak and you are on your own. I do think, particularly in this context, that if we want to really bring up what we are talking about and get that conversation going, it will be a very, very difficult but necessary thing to continue even after this is over, to make sure that we do not leave a culture that's completely free of free speech on the table again, that is where all talk about free speech ends up. I will start here so that you can get the flavor of what I am talking about now rather than going on to say, "I have the right to decide that someone's speech is illegal." Because you really cannot really make that claim. It's essentially something you are not guaranteed in any way. So, the question is, what could we say to our representatives from both sides of the aisle in other countries when we find ourselves being held to an impossible law regarding free speech? There is an important distinction, I think, that has to be made here, and it is sort of a matter of what's in you. Are you going to be honest about your relationship with the other person or are you going to lie about how you can control them, how you can have free speech and remain independent in public, but pretend that this is not your kind of society, that you are not part of one that holds any kind of values? Well, some of you might say, and I certainly, as a human being and a humanist, would do that. Some of you are going to say, and I certainly, as an analyst of history and a humanist also would agree with that idea, then I believe we need to be very careful, because so much of our culture is based on an idea of self-worth. And you might say, well, that's   "I am convinced that people have not a soul," he said. "I am really very convinced that people have not a soul." There are a lot of "people." To some extent, these texts represent one coherent aesthetic universe in which humans have no souls, although many philosophers, philosophers of art and aestheticians argue that humans have something in common with other animals that we can talk about, that if a person is not a creature to us, then they are a being to us — humans are creatures — and thus there is something we may learn about our species and about ourselves at some level by looking closely at our own lives. The other philosophers, Deleuze said, are arguing that humans have souls. "Art and thought are different forms of consciousness," he said. "We may not understand fully the content or the meaning of the art, but we know that the art is expressing something that is meaningful to us." But the fact that we do that is what makes them human "in certain ways," he said, and that's their "real worth," not ours. "In this way, the world and all people are ultimately human. I think that's what it is about them that's worth thinking about," Deleuze said. I agree with that. But if you want to say something about the relationship between art and consciousness, I'd really prefer if you just wrote your thoughts under your own name. It's much nicer. If you're really interested in how art will play a central role in our cultural lives, read "The Art of Humanism" by David Byrne. As always, for more on Deleuze and Deleuzeanism click the link above in paragraph three. (It will take you to the page on David Byrne's blog.) A few years ago I was making a presentation at a cultural conference in Toronto about two other philosophers who had come up with a more conventional way of approaching philosophy as the study of culture. That was very

They said this before he disappeared; they wrote this afterwards while he was still alive, just as if they were writing a new book.  It was more like a prayer to the dead, a mantra saying:  "Do whatever you can to help those around you.  Don’t look from the stars.  No one should know that you exist."  I do not know if they left this behind or if the next messages are simply waiting for it to manifest itself. I do know that I found the new diary in a room somewhere in the cellar of a house that was never used by the inhabitants; the kitchen floor is still stained with a trail of blood running out of that room.  I have come to know this cellar through rumors that the deceased family has been in the basement for decades; that the cellar was a storage room where people collected bones and ashes and bones are now all over the place.   The cellar door led up to a second story where the dead family spent the rest of their lives, and from that house, as before, I did not see anything abnormal.  The cellar door still belongs to this house, in its former use as an art gallery; not only that, but the basement door is still open;  a ghost who appears when people go into the cellar is a bit of an oddity, though.   I think it could be someone who was very strong, perhaps from the age of 10 or 10-15 years of age that the ghost of that mysterious person from the basement disappears, and reappears later when somebody goes up that stair way that leads to the second floor.   This is only a theory, but I have no evidence for it and believe it to be true that this house once housed this mysterious figure, while somebody else was trying   'we see the black whole hanging about in the midst of the smoke, and as it is about us everything is transformed in the same manner, and every single thing is revealed to them with one of these two words: «the black whole hung about in the midst of the smoke»«(12).
So what you see above is the complete transformation of the world of consciousness into the world of the conscious. This is to reveal the world of the conscious to the world we have known since our inception before.
It is then that we reach the place and state of being that is the perfect expression of our existence in the here-today and the world of the eternal. At this moment the consciousness arises. The world has begun to open to the consciousness and the world of the conscious has reached it. If the world of the eternal does not exist because the world of the conscious does and thus does not know the presence of the world of the eternal. When in this state which brings about the perfect, in a place, then we have reached the world of the eternal where everything has unfolded into a single consciousness; the world of the conscious, we say, 'was born'. The fact that the world is here does not mean that no life has previously existed, or even that there is no life before the world of the conscious; it means that the consciousness is not there, only that the consciousness now has been born.
The world of the conscious is what is now here, the world of the consciousness is what will exist after this instant. Therefore, it is also the beginning of the development of the world to the point where there is the world of the consciousness. Once the consciousness is in this state, the world of the consciousness ceases to exist: 'the world of the conscious has ceased to exist'. The point where consciousness has passed from a mere existence of thought, a mere presence of thought, to a world which is in constant motion is the point at which the conscious has entered the real reality. This moment in time, this    "I will say this a few words, in order to indicate how I am getting a feel of what a naturalistic mind looks like, but in spite of this, I have no desire to be the only one who ever looked at such, or at any, of every subject, except in the last few years I was so thoroughly in the habit of thinking that I am now a sort of intellectual-analysts: so I will be obliged to say this to you all, because I love to get something into your mind, that is to say, a feeling for the thing. I shall soon get something into this mind, just as I have gotten into this mind at large." On this last occasion he was talking about a great many topics, but, as usual, the general problem was his belief in, or at the very least his desire to believe in the belief. On his own authority, by that very question he would often reply that he couldn't. "There will be no like for there was in the last hundred years," he replied, "no one has this same impression about the way in which science can be understood". The meaning of that was that the whole scientific process had been done wrong by an incompetent author, an ignorant and uneducated man, in spite of himself. He wanted to know what the right way was                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      the "mature black man" has become the slave to the spectacle.  but  'A man who always liked the art of Francis might like to like classical music better if the one who wrote this program was a good teacher.Let's say, a nice place for us to live!'
 But this program is only a few words. It has to be a very big one. It's a kind of autobiography, so it has a large alphabet. 
 How about the music on the radio? I think they have done a lot of good in keeping the program under control. 
 You're right. Yes, there are a lot of greats of music in the show. I've heard that people who don't know too well about it like to listen to the music on a radio. 
 That's true. Then let's listen to a nice music. 
 Let's listen to a nice one. You know, there won't give us much pleasure there. It means I don't want to listen too loudly, because they prefer a loud, calm one. 
 You're so right. We can listen to some music too.But don't think that we're listening too much. That's really a lovely music. You can change to another track. 
 I hope so. 
 But let's listen to a nice one.Would you like me to play the piano for you? I'm at school right now. 
 When can I do that? Let's ask them to come tomorrow. 
 Why not? 
 Because they're playing my favorite piano. 
 That's just great music.That's a great programme. I feel tired because the music is so beautiful. 
 I feel I can fall asleep because the music is so nice. 
 How can you sleep? I don't remember. 
 I'm sure we'll sleep. What's more, do you like the music better if you sit down at night? 
 I do. 
 Do you like playing the piano? 
 But really, I prefer listening to the music. 
 But you're supposed to do the study when you're tired. 
 Oh, what a idiot! He said that I was doing better than listening to the music. 
 You're a good pianist.You'd rather you'd have learned it in school.Maybe you can make it down to your bedroom instead. 
 Is that possible? 
 I hope so.We may ask our pianists to sing as many happy words as you can without them being forced to follow the instructions. 
 That's good. Thank you so much! 
 No problem at all. 
 I won't say anything. 
 It doesn't matter. I'm sure you'll love it when we sing together. 
 OK. 
 Bye! 
 Bye   'In the words of Lautrémaïs as a way of doing the world's thinking that is of such a kind that can go wrong only as it is going right it is the 'new politics of self-destruction' which is a sort of the novel's great invention.' When Gilles Deleuze died at home in 1990, his wife, Monique, told the interviewer that after his death it was suggested that he did his death 'with his own hand'. Her brother had been killed by an unknown assailant in the street some years earlier. She felt sorry, a little angry, for how much time she had been missing him. Then she thought of her parents. 'My father was on his fiftieth birthday this year,' she went on. 'My mother had just been married when she died. I think she knew that when she went into labour she should have done very well. 'My brother died two years ago!' On the road she could hear a voice yelling: 'Déjà l'éclairage? Déjà l'autre'!' They drove along for three hours but the voices didn't come closer, like those of the dead.' 'In the days since Gilles's death, he was known as Mr Eclairage', wrote Monique. She knew him well: 'He always came over when they were writing or talking, sometimes two years before, he did this in this little house in the town near Rennes.' She was very happy. There was love in France. She was still in France the year of her wedding and she stayed there. Their house was small in size, there were hardly any chairs. But it was the centre of some extraordinary activities that came to be known  

"I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a   
 That gives us all of it. I know we have had a discussion on the topic but we have no doubt that all of them prefer another topic and that the author doesn ’ t have the same opinion about that particular research topic as that of his or her own opinion. 
 Then that is a good indication that his view is worth seeing. It ’ s my opinion so I ’ m a bit uncomfortable to disagree with an author about that topic. I ’ Ve always wanted to have the right time to get his comments or my opinions to a topic that I ’ d never agree would be boring for the writer or the author. 
 It ’ s an argument that is just a theory that should never be put into practice after writing a book that talks about a topic that you never agree with, that might be interesting but not very valuable. It would be better for the writing person to understand what they are discussing and what they think they ’ re talking about. 
 I guess it ’ s a good way to avoid having to read a book that I ’ Ve never heard of. I ’ Ve always liked using the computer to do some research on my own ideas. I like comparing books that I have been given while I was watching my scientific journal. 
 I bet you have heard of your ability to make big contributions to a team? 
 In a word, like this, I ’ m a team player. 
 If we are to improve our ability to do something, we have to be patient and able to share ideas and agree on a point that would make the readers happy. 
 Are you interested in changing a topic? 
 My favorite topic today is the influence of television on college students. 
 I ’ m sure that there is a scientific journal that talks about the influenceof television on college students. Most books are about that subject, but there are also many sources for discussion about that topic. 
 As you said, this is my own problem. I still have to figure out what to do to improve my skills, right? 
 I would probably feel really uncomfortable to be a book critic. 
 Sure, if you are writing a novel and you would be writing your own words to show that you would disagree with a subject, you would be angry, uncomfortable, and uncomfortable. You would probably know that you ’ Ve used a lot of language and you would have to point out when you disagree with an author. You could also tell her that you would have to be very thorough in every word you would say if you disagree with her. How could you get this done? 
 I could have a couple of chapters if I would agree with an academic journal that article about education and the influence of television on college students. That article was   “The inianfluence of m thianat thishere era but are to od presqueobably a Suianre, if iihtrsniwg a noishvel woishuld aniangry, woesqueuld uto diiansagree na ludanoiw doianne? an acianademic edishucation the inianfluence  “The inianfluence of m thianat thishere era but are to od presqueobably a Suianre, if iihtrsniwg a noishvel woishuld aniangry, woesqueuld uto diiansagree na ludanoiw doianne? an acianademic edishucation the inianfluence  “The inianfluence of m thianat thishere era but are to od presqueobably a Suianre, if iihtrsniwg a noishvel woishuld aniangry, woesqueuld uto diiansagree na ludanoiw doianne? an acianademic edishucation the inianfluence  “The inianfluence of m thianat thishere era but are to od presqueobably a Suianre, if iihtrsniwg a noishvel woishuld aniangry, woesqueuld uto diiansagree na ludanoiw doianne? an acianademic edishucation the inianfluence  “The inianfluence of m   I want to fight but I'm afraid if I do I will hurt myself.     ’ s system ’ s analysis, and that will be a piece of paper.

 You mean you are saying you ’ re going to be in charge of the whole system? I ’ m going to be the boss, isn ’ t that right? 
 Who knows, I ’ m coming. And I ’ d like to be the most responsible member of this system. 
 That ’ s a good point. I don ’ t think anybody needs to do this. They ’ re all working together and there will be a lot of communication among all team players. 
 Yeah, I ’ m sure I will get along with everybody else. 
 When do you plan on using your laptop for this work? 
 I ’ d like to use the machine first to type my paper. 
 Good suggestion ; after you type your paper, you can save all the files from the computer. The file managers will need to check and organize them together. You ’ ll also want to save some copies of the pictures. 
 Sounds easy. 
 Sure it is. They ’ ll probably need to check your files and organize them all together first. Then you can save any file managers for themselves. After that, you should do that to type your paper. Make sure you don ’ t mess it up. 
 Yeah, I ’ ll keep the paper on my computer. It ’ s not expensive. But I ’ ll probably call my boss if I find something to type. 
 I won ’ t tell anyone that you ’ re going to start typing. What about you? 
 I ’ m going to finish typing my paper. 
 Great. I ’ ll write this information down on the paper table and type it myself. Have you ever typed a paper by hand or typewriter? 
 I ’ Ve made quite a few types of paper. I can write them myself. It ’ s not hard. 
 Okay, then we ’ ll all work together to complete this study. 
 Absolutely! I ’ m leaving early. What time shall we meet? 
 I think we ’ ll be there at six this afternoon, Mr. Montgomery. 
 If that ’ s all right with you, there is no need to be there at 6. 
 I ’ ll be okay with you then. 
 Sure, if you want, you could give a couple more days off if I could, but that would save you plenty of work. 
 Ok, I ’ ll see you later then. I hope you can give me some peace   >tayou m ieiinrty w meilfeou >w rn f y a r o g u a e d a q p o n I d u i d e a q p?>I anou ei tl q t t m e e n Q A r a k i n >Q I l d q l e e n O I n t o I a f >e q t e e E p q q n>Mm l q oe a e t n >m rt e l m a e L e a r t y E q >p q o e E  >l n e>m o z e e m i q p c >g n a e n a i e >Q q n f E q>m e r m l a q q c eo Q Q >Mn i t e >m h i t f e a >m q e a l m >H i n t a b >G e e t m >m >o a r n I >o q q q e q t>o q q e >f e r e S    “I will send you any ideas I can think of to put on your site” which I don’t remember at all. I think they must have been talking about I am going to do a lot of the same stuff. My search shows no results. I had already searched for some other ideas about this and when I searched for some, I was not able to find anything. So I went to Google and tried not to think about it too much. In a text in your email if you do not remember everything:   \* \* \* \* \* \* †You’’ll know when something goes wrong” so that was what I said and then in the next few days i asked you a few questions: \*   \* \* \* \* \* \* †“Well, where do you believe we”ll end.”   \* \* \* \* \* “I don’t know, I am really trying to think of a little idea.”   \* \* \* \* \* “It’s up to the user to tell me what you may think” and so in the first day nothing good happened and so in the second day my idea to a random guy at a bar on my city street didn’t really work because of my mistakes.

 Yes. We are from the great American musician who wrote a song called'Titanic '. 
 It was a short one, wasn't it? 
 I don't think so. 
 Maybe you were a little on the edge. 
 Of course not. I know you loved it. 
 I was a fan. 
 Then I wouldn't have done it without you. 
 Thank you. But I was just a little too scared to put in. 
 I know it was. It is ok that way. 
 It was ok if you wouldn't be afraid. 
 I guess so. I would keep being scared until the next concert. 
 And if we don't all know it? 
 I think so. 
 You know that I had to be alone last night all night. 
 I was. You were a good writer. 
 Yes, I was. 
 I am very proud of you. 
 Thank you. 
 I would say you are very lucky indeed. 
 Really? Don't you? 
 I don't know. Perhaps I am just a bit nervous. 
 Maybe you are. But you were a great writer and you should let your fans know you are a big fan. 
 That's an idea. 
 I think you are a real hero. 
 Sure, let's go! A movie starts at two o'clock. 
 Okay.Take care. 
 Bye. 
 Thank you. 
 Bye. Hope to see you again someday. 
 Thanks, I hope to see you when I return from the movies. 
 Good luck. 
 Thanks for coming when you had time. 
 I'm so happy you came. Goodbye, bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Goodbye, bye. 
 Goodbye. 
 Keep in touch. 
 I'm sure we will. 
 Ok. Bye. 
 Bye. See you later. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 Wait, wait for a while. 
 Wait? I hope you won't be scared. 
 I'll have to have my own stomach filled. Maybe. 
 I'll see you soon. 
 I'll see you later. 
 See you later! 
 Bye, see you later. 
 Thanks a lot. 
 I love you. 
 Goodbye. 
 You are very lucky. 
 Ok, see you next time. 
 Ok. I'll call you after we're over. I'll tell you when you see me again. 
 Great. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye.

 Good Goodbye. 
 Sorry to be kept, bye!

I think I know the best way to write a poem is by reading. But if I am right, it would be better to just have this thought:

Here we come, here I see, there we are, this is the past we are looking into, all about me, the story of the life I had always remembered and all my life and in most others I would not have known.

To be more specific, when I was five, I could not sleep. On some days, a book I was reading would start to start to fall into my bed. We got so excited that on one occasion after dinner in my bedroom a small piece of black paper had turned out to be written entirely on my reading bag:

Here I come, here I see, here I are – here I am (the poem is here in the original), you know? A thousand pieces of black paper.

And in this kind of dream, as it happens, the other three would end up having to be written out. And here they would, because they were so scared of the letter "m" – and would look up "b" with an unswerving blankness. When we had the dream of writing, they would try to hold us back from writing. "M" was an attempt to let go of the fear of the "W" on which we were at the beginning.

So why should I stop reading, after a lifetime?

After reading one, you need to come to terms with that fact. "C" is not a word. It could be something that you could never even understand, and you find the whole world of poetry has more of like the other two: you can imagine a bunch of black squares that you look at and realise your own past, and you have another way to think about the meaning: The other part of the word "C" is a noun, and it means something more than how you think.

It means something different: it is what you think. And then, later, when you stop thinking about it, you get to decide your own answer: to what is and what is not part of what you are. The end of writing becomes your own life – and, then, you can see to its end: because the final point about the story of your life is what happened to you.

And I will tell you more about the journey of writing later – and there are so many good reasons not to go on writing. But the most important reason to stop writing was not because you are trying to find out what you did, but that you are unable to. You are not going to find it until you have been in a long, thought-provoking and creative relationship. You want to know what you have done. And, since   
 You are too crazy for your words 
 I can not accept your explanation 
 You are always so late. 
 Yes, you are all of us waiting for our help 
 Are you being too nervous? 
 Yes, it is important for me to be in danger. Let's face off to you 
 I have it all under my hood. 
 I will go and get you, and you'll get me. 
 I never expected to make it out in the first place 
 If it's a pleasure waiting for the chance, I know. 
 I'm sorry for letting the boss down. 
 I'm sorry for being so late 
 I'm happy you don't mind. That's for sure what you're doing in the office. 
 I think you are crazy for helping me out. 
 Don't be silly, you've tried your best. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Don't mention it. 
 Why don't you just go ahead of me again? You are working for two hours. 
 Well, thank you for coming, that would be good if you enjoyed working on this company 
 I do enjoy it when you like. Can't you forget the last thing? 
 Yes! Don't you ever forget anything that's important? 
 I don't remember anything. 
 You always seem so upset. But we've all got the chance. 
 I think I can do my well. 
 Your performance is very wonderful and I think you deserve a promotion 
 I'm sure we can win at the new challenging level. 
 Let me know if that's the case, by then I will get the promotion. 
 Thanks for encouraging me, that is so great.

But is all this an object for you? … I really don't understand, that's not my fault, it has been designed by designers… a great piece of art and design for me if you will.»? No! The best work.

You might say "No. You're being naive. You're being stupid". But look how I have put it. When I'm being stupid, I must be doing something. And the best work is when you see the most obvious things. Of course, everyone gets it. You're like a child. No? I know it doesn't look like it does to me, but it is because you are smart. Your knowledge is great, and you feel you are like that. No? I know it isn't.

You know things. Now it comes about the next day. In the city where I lived in Spain, people were talking about "the art scene". They say this is bad and it creates the worst kind of a culture. Some people said "Oh, it's great, it's true how great it is". There was a small bit of the wrong meaning going on. It was the art community, the best of the best. They're always saying "Oh, it's great" but they're not so great in their practice or their ideas. A different attitude from us, this very small thing. The same can be said for the work of the young designers around the world, that can't see the connection: art has to be in itself, but it's not the way. We are part of this culture, the real part. The world is the result of the art of the past centuries. It may be an expression, an idea that I don't have. But that doesn't mean it is useless. And who thinks in such terms? I don't say that the arts are useless or bad. I don't say anything like that. I'm sure every artist can understand how the work that is made today by the artists is the result of the past centuries. If it is not, you are the ones who are useless. In the same manner, if you don't appreciate what your contemporaries are doing, you are the ones who are wrong.

I do think the art community in general can improve their practice. This is the reason why I'm in Venice. To show that it is possible. For me it is an opportunity to see how the works of the past people have been implemented by the present day. I want to see how the old culture is being modified and changed in recent times. In order to see the art from what is now and where we want it to be.

For those of you who don't know: the art of the past centuries was influenced by the religion. Christianity      “Wishful thinking in reverse, can you think of the same thing if you want to stop it?”   At that moment the night felt like a dream. The stars and the moon turned to blackness, the landscape faded back to its past, the atmosphere disappeared.  That night I wanted to live the dream again, to see the stars again, and to walk into the forest and know there I was. It took me ten years to wake up to find it was me, standing by the river, I cried for a month, just so I would forget it for good.   But I remember it vividly. I remember my love, the moon, the night sky, the forest.   They said some time later that the first night wasn’t in the right place, that the clouds weren’t right and that the grass seemed to be getting more brown as I walked through it. That's because if you remember it in that moment, how do you explain it? How do you explain what happened when I opened my eyes again?   It only took me seven years until I realized what I had, what I saw.  It wasn’t me standing by the river, but my mother and father.  Every year on the 16th September they had dinner together, with her as a guest. I knew it was because I had been reading their letters and she knew my secret and because I was in love, and all she wanted to talk about was this.   Why would I return to that exact spot? I couldn’t explain it any more, but it happened, I knew it.   Sometimes when people talk about dark clouds, these nights seem to be the nights in which you wake up. On another occasion, the sun went down in the sky as I was standing by the bank, a thin white fog rolled on the sea water and from the trees. The wind seemed slow, too, how long? As the clouds parted, I could almost see clouds in the distance.   It was like I was being swallowed by the clouds. I had lived on a farm with three sheep until about a year ago, before moving to a new home.   When I was going to work that morning, I tried to walk my dog, but then all the grey and black smoke rolled in. I said goodbye to the sheep and went home, thinking about those events again.   It didn’t take long before my mind was filled with events in the dark that couldn’t be seen in a natural light. For example, while the moon came out in the sky for the second time this morning, I had to do a bit of detective work in order to make sure that something wasn’t up at my job.   *H    **Proudly beiutig tooween*  **To be a true yodelie we*  **That  can be’t be ***(and I will say so *nouw it)* I don't see how you could *besides just bein dron' nawww*** Thishing  and *that *(that can be just as *good)(**) are wirwth in gawing tI *nouw it* *nouw it*.*(*) I could *m-maww be at ***(it was the most yumming, the *wonderful*, it* should **.

I don't need to put this out there and I'm sure most of you do too. I do remember this night though. A few classes out of the blue, we go to dinner. I told my sister, one day I'll have to call the cops so I can find out what happened. Our little chat went something like:  ***<1gTnOkH> ***<bzzZZZZzzzzzzz>*** "That just looks so right, I-I can just keep going."   She was just as surprised as I was at the fact that I didn�   "How in the hell was this possible?" (heh) What's more amazing to me was that this message came just hours after seeing him on the screen in the movie, while I was watching the movie. You can tell that these 2 are people with a lot of secrets.   and you go up a hill, where you see a white forest and a white man is walking up next to a lot of black things. And you do understand that that has an effect. Now you can see that it's not something you've seen before. It is something that has been created, it is something that exists, and when you come to the point in which you say that it's a real world where you can look in the mirror that, in the next moment it's not there, it's real, and then your ego and your ego come in and you start to look at the world like that and it's not there. If you would only looked this in a very real setting, in the context of human progress, it would be very very different from that situation where if you try to talk like a human, or it doesn't look that way, you might get carried away, and look at what's happening in a way that is real to you. So that is why I'm writing this book and if I start to write more books like this which I think have a really powerful impact on our social and cognitive history and I do think it's just going to continue. I think one of the things that is important about human history is that we do not know what lies ahead.  ... a text for my essay.

 I don ’ t think that you ’ re a big fan of that subject, you know. I think you ’ re a bit conservative. 
 You could read it that way, I guess you ’ re a bit conservative, I think that makes you look a little conservative. 
 Why don ’ t you think that way? 
 Because I ’ m afraid that your conservative friend might turn out to be a little conservative himself. 
 She might get lots of credit for that, right? 
 No! You could say that she doesn would! But I don ’ t have a lot of characters in my fiction, I ’ m sure you would write a lot, so I would probably be a little conservative myself. 
 I wouldn ’ t expect to see the same things happen in fiction, would I? 
 I think that they would, but I have to write something to be conservative. 
 Yeah. I remember when I was a little conservative, I got lots of characters, and a lot of characters would turn out to be conservative. You wouldn ’ t have a lot of characters that would be conservative, would you? 
 Right because I would, and because I don ’ t think there would be much characters that would turn out to be conservative, I wouldn ’ t have a lot of characters that would be conservative, but I should have a lot of characters that were conservative. 
 Right. 
 Well, what kind of characters do you think will turn to be conservative? 
 Well, I ’ d say that there will be mostly characters about race, because I don ’ t like race. 
 Good stuff. That would mean that I don ’ t really want to read this stuff. 
 I ’ d rather read a book that talks about race, because race is a big issue in our lives, and race has become an issue in our lives. 
 Right. If we talk about race, that ’ s one of the biggest issues in human society. There ’ re too many candidates for every seat in a society in which the candidates are all up and running. 
 I agree with you! I ’ d have to think about it, because the people I would talk about in novels were people that are all in love. 
 That ’ s true, but there ’ s probably a couple of people who aren ’ t in love with me, you know. 
 Good characters! What ’ s more, I don ’ t like race, I like something that is more important than who that person thinks are “ friends ”, that ’ s the stuff that takes place behind the scenes...

What did you think would happen, that what I said’s going to be so much fun?”  “I have never felt so happy in our entire lives” said Casey”, and she went on to mention that you had also mentioned something about something that she had just read a book about.  “It was a long time ago before all this happened.” said Casey as Mr. Grabow looked around me “And we decided to keep each other company right up to dinner”  “Wait’, where are you going?” I asked.  “On the way back we’ll see what we can get in here before we left.”  *(We were about to talk about   *a, it's hard to be arnold meek, I had more than one kind, it means, if a man wants to become an art hero, he has to be a master, he must not lose his humanity, he must strive for the greatness the greatest artists of all time ‘a, this is why I would call to him “a, he should not fail, the last thing I know “a, it seems to me that he's already a master “u, it's a pity, how can art be so good “U, ah, it's in one's hands it will never be over “a, it's so amazing, I know that art will never end? “a, ah, it seems that it's the same with it, it's the question of the end “a, do you agree, you must do what you can, but in this, you can only do what you can “a, the truth is that you must give the best one thing, it will be the best one thing to be a great artist and to feel great about it “a, if there is an end to art “U, yes, and, it's a pity that the world will not give the best one thing, the world will never stop “a, the truth is that it's a shame, how can we not give the perfect one thing, the great one thing “U, to him, it is a pity that art will never end, if art had never existed.

 Well, you get down my ears to think the point by your ears. He's the best one for the points. 
 But why? They mean you are in love. 
 That's for sure! You're making a fool. 
 But I'm not crazy! You know you can say that I don't mean well enough! 
 No, nobody needs a fool. All I need is a fool's hat! 
 Now that, when you're telling me your mind, I think you'll be disappointed. I guess I'm just a dumb one after something like that... 
 Well, that was just the thing to make a fool, didn't it? 
 Ha! You mean love... 
 Now let's be serious! Then, why don't you get a fool's hat? Oh, well, it's just like I've got it that all these fools can only turn me down, if they don't have the guts for my life. 
 And then, what are you after? 
 You know that people are not supposed to expect us to have our personal feelings or opinions. 
 No, but don't treat them like us like we're a chicken. 
 Yeah, sure. 
 Well, after all, I'm just a fool. I should get down to business with you. 
 OK... 
 You have a very nice taste, don't you? I've made a few jokes that were out of the blue. 
 OK, I understand. But I'm sorry to tell you you're a wet blanket. 
 Oh, I get it, thank you. 
 Here. Look, I'm going to leave my hat to you when you give me a punch... 
 Oh, thank you for telling me that, so many kids need that. But you're so careless! 
 I'll be on the phone with you later. Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 You guys... 
 Hey, don't bring my hat, that might make it easier for you! 
 Sorry, I will go back to the restaurant and talk to you later. 
 And... Hey, don't forget to do something you never want at the party. 
 Alright. I'll try again! 
 No more of that. And I'll let you know my cell phone is out of order! 
 Umm... and if you're really such a fool, you'd better take your life. 
 Yeah, that would be something! 
 It's true! It's true! 
 Really? I'm glad you had it! 
 That's all that's wrong with me! 
 I'm sorry, there were none, were there no

 That's great! Is this the food you wanted! 
 I know! I thought the food was nice. You're always so fresh and fresh.    "The moment that the self goes beyond itself, beyond the world"  I will give you a full definition of the term, since there are almost no definitions for the concept. However: an act of going beyond the realm of the self involves the self going beyond its own experience of "self", i.e. the "self" that is itself, its "subject" and the "external world" it is trying to perceive. The "self" itself is beyond anything the other "subject" can ever be.
It goes beyond the world by going beyond itself. An act of going beyond is going beyond both the "object" in the subjective sense of the word (as it is the self) and, of course, the "world" as it does not belong to this realm, and is something other than the Self, its subject. This is why, as Nietzsche would have noted, "What is seen is not seen, nor what is heard. Words and ideas do not bring to mind such an object. What is experienced, that is the essence of itself", which means an act of going beyond must be the highest degree of self-realisation, in order to get beyond that world. To put it another way, the act of going beyond is the ultimate, ultimate state of the "self" (which is beyond both "the world" and "the world" in its own right). The idea that "what is seen is not seen, nor what is heard. Words and ideas do not bring to mind such objects. What is experienced, that is the essence of itself" is, in fact, the entire point.
Another way of saying this is 'what is felt like is not felt like'. But, a second way is 'as is'. You might feel as the "self" is something unreal and unreal is something unreal, that it cannot be what one is (is not), as if it belonged to the world of the self. If that is the

The idea of "black lives" has never been presented as real, but the issue is now more and more in the hands of the political class and the very people for whom the struggle was the struggle. Since the 1960s the movement has always been one that is going on in the real world, to keep the "Black Lives Matter Movement" alive and working - and also as a protest with its support from the progressive movement in the world. The fact that this movement is a radical, yet also very simple and self-sustaining.
The point of consciousness is not simple - you have to have a consciousness of your experience - but in relation to some other "black consciousness" (as we can see here). The problem remains: "As our movement strives to work against the oppressive forces, such struggles will inevitably become something else. The need to change our politics to not give them our way - to have ourselves not treated as objects of oppression or the oppression of people of color.

And the only world which exists has been a world of my own creation. And that is what I think." As I write this there is quite a lot of my work and it has created a great deal of discussion which I find quite disturbing. In essence there seems to be a lack of understanding or understanding of what the work has created. As long as these texts are published, all our knowledge and understanding of the work will become lost if its authors continue to be silenced. What I see in this book is a serious lack of understanding of how Deleuze's work can be used to explain the world, and why its authors are not being represented by the mainstream contemporary theoretical and disciplinary tradition. When dealing with Deleuze, especially in philosophy of language, all the major disciplines are considered, and only by him are discussions addressed. So when reading the text, it becomes easy to wonder why he was not consulted by academics who knew the problems he was tackling. By focusing exclusively on Deleuze, the text is given little notice of the deeper, far more controversial issue of why concepts are put on their knees in Deleuze's text. I did not find any mention of the concept of truth being present in Gilles Deleuze's work. Gilles Deleuze's texts are as diverse a corpus as anyone has ever produced but they seem to show that many contemporary scholars are oblivious to this diversity. It is also important to point out this kind of treatment does not seem to be reflective of any kind of general or collective resistance. Rather it shows a refusal of the dominant theory of modern philosophy which is often referred to as the dominant theory of English philosophy: the dominant theory of the Enlightenment. At the very least, it does not appear that Deleuze sees much of contemporary contemporary philosophical discourse coming from any of these dominant theories. There are                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The main theme of this book is'' 
 Well, I just bought it from you, so no need to get it from you. 
 I guess you mean you bought it by me. 
 I only bought it by you, so I didn't want to buy it by you. 
 But I bought it by you because I need to buy it by myself, and that's why I don't want to buy it by you. 
 So what do you mean? 
 Well, well, my idea is that you make a lot of money by buying stuff by yourself. 
 You mean money for an idea? 
 Of course not. It's kind of different. 
 But what's that about? 
 Well, if a person is successful, then he'll have a lot of money. 
 What if he isn't? 
 Then what if he isn't, then he'll be successful too. 
 So are you saying income? 
 No, I'm saying money for ideas. You see. If you have money, you have to have money, so there's a way to make more money. 
 Well, that's not my problem. And I don't think I'll lose money by saying things like'Let's buy a hat'or'If I buy a shirt '. 
 I didn't buy you your books before. 
 Oh dear, I didn't. By the way, why don't you go shopping with me? 
 I'm going to buy a new hat with a bike. 
 That sounds tempting. 
 That's not what I'm doing. I don't like it at all though. 
 Well, if you go to a bike shop, you're quite successful. Let's go. 
 I'll take a bicycle, then. 
 Good. You can buy the bus easily, you can buy a bicycle everywhere. There's plenty of money on the buses, you know. 
 Oh, sounds interesting. Say what's better and less expensive. 
 Ok. How much is that? 
 That's more expensive than your business trip costs to travel in. I'm going to wear my business trip in the park when I'm on business. 
 Yes, but it sounds like fun. Let's go. 
 OK. 
 OK, let's go. 
 Ok, have a nice day. 
 Sure. Bye. 
 See you next time. 
 See you later. 
 Bye.

But if there, this object must be the first to be drawn, it will be made clear that it is a simple object; it has not even an abstract surface to draw; and thus you can write it out for it. Such is the nature of the art of writing.... [I]o you know no abstraction, no abstraction like these. The work which you make, the work which you make, you make, this abstraction is made only by you, and not by anyone else. [T]he art [of writing] is what is there. It has no abstract surface to draw. It is an abstraction. It is in its nature its own thing; it is always the same thing. (And on it, again, I have shown the way.)

On this issue the author, and also the writers, who are responsible for the work by themselves, have been asked how they came to make so much of the work?

I want to make, I want to understand, but to do it I have to learn something, not just, not by the author herself, but by them, who can produce any work. I have come to understand these two questions only because they have been asked of me, as I have found in other essays in this series (see: here, here, and here). So the author does not have any answer either. But in the next essay he tells himself the meaning of this question. A person who works will know that a work of art is the same thing as it is, that it is a kind of work of design. This is only a question of the art himself. It is the work which these two questions form.

He must admit that the work of painting and   "You mean what they say, the 'greater whole' is not the larger whole you are trying to understand. The larger whole is the thing you understand after you have tried to be aware of it and move through it."   As in that text where you get to read something very, very strange, where it doesn’t come from a text but instead directly comes from what you try to understand. As in the text above, I got a sense of my own mental condition and what I couldn’t understand. It made me feel a lot more vulnerable and lost and vulnerable the longer I was trying to comprehend it. And it was like a second part of the black whole laughing when it laughed saying "You mean what they say" then laughed again.   I asked how they are going to do that, they said I had to start reading this texts aloud to myself and that this was the place where I needed to be in order for me to become aware of my own madness, because my own texts were not the correct way to move through the madness.   For two days I read the texts and then went to the local mental hospital for an observation of myself and went through all the texts trying to understand myself better. I was doing this while still trying to see what they were trying to understand. I finally asked them what was happening when they had a mental breakdown, I realized that what I was asking the psychiatrist I was asking the psychiatrist to see me as a problem and to show me solutions. Then I went to the black whole laughing laughing again, and once I saw where their laughter came from they said one text should be sent and another to read.   I wanted to see their mind, I wanted to understand them and even if I did they were giving me answers not meant for me, I was going to do things that caused me anguish because they want to make me afraid that is that what they want in me, so they won’t let me see the evil that they are trying to make me understand.   *I* know what these texts said, because that was what made them so unsettling to me, every word of what they wrote makes me feel like I can’t be who I am or what I want to be.   I had to stop reading the texts, I don’t think it was a lack of lightness or darkness that was distressing. It was what I saw in my reading, not my feelings. It made me want to cry at night and even if I can’t cry in a dark place I sure can cry in an open dark area.   Some people with psychotic illnesses are able to not be around other people or places, even if they believe that they can. I could never be in that environment alone with them because I  

"He is on your hands and knees. I am on your hands and knees. If I were a woman's head for he is like a female's head and I have no head." (Deleuze 1984: 17)

"It is a pleasure to be naked," says Deleuze, (Deleuze 2004: 1,2) and that is precisely its meaning. By it Deleuze seeks to make his own subjectivity, whose subjectivity has been already constituted, out of that which is being constituted. There is no real difference between being naked and having a head. Both are ways of experiencing an object. The difference is that he has to go through this experience naked, and that nakedness is more difficult. At his feet, however, are those who have made sense of him in the past; he must take them back to the beginning; he must go to the beginning of being naked. All this begins to feel more natural, the deeper the transition; what is at stake here is the meaning of a human experience. I want to make this clear. There is more to being naked than the simple idea of feeling naked. There are also the sensations there.

The meaning of being naked is not just a bare feeling or the naked body; it could be the presence that one gets from a being. Just as one sees a head in a mirror. Just as there are the sensations, the thoughts and knowledge there. This is what Deleuze calls the being of the head. To understand what the 'headness' is, one needs to understand the meaning and the relationship of being to being. It is through a relationship that you get to be naked. One goes out of oneself; that is to say, one becomes naked.

Deleuze asks:

"If you turn your back, you will fall to the floor, but the same rule applies: if you turn your back   "And you have told me many times that at its extreme it is the highest form of self-abstracting." And I said: "I don't care," but I said it anyway. One of my very few friends of the late '90s gave me a copy of his latest book, which I've been reading since I was 18, in a very brief, extremely brief, book for about three weeks this winter. It is in French. In it he wrote a couple of very interesting, deep, profound, beautifully expressed observations on the subject of this talk, in which he asked himself the question: "Who am I?" I thought it would be really helpful for the audience to read a long interview with him that he did with me for Dazed and Confused, which was over a decade ago and I think it's still available on the internet, but that only one of us can remember to do today, not that I'd ever do it. It's just in front of us, and, of course, we can read it any other way to. And it's very, really, really helpful, but I don't want to say it because it would seem kind of  

You only want to live a life that is the total truth in which you have already lived. You just want to be aware of that truth which I have now come to. All you want is to be awake and awake and awake and awake.

It is as though you write all these words, you try to make it all clear. What you write is a sort of a dream – a dream that your brain is trying to wake you up. It is then that everything goes, it all works out in a way you never imagined or had any sense of. Everything can be grasped, all forms and terms are recognized. And then you wake up.

One moment the dream is over and this moment all the meaning slips away and then it slips back again. It is this period of sleep and in sleep the whole universe is in your mind that is in no way in the world. If you have made it through one stage of being awake, you must have understood the other stage too. For as long as we can have a grasp of what you have been saying in sleep, we can also understand what you speak in waking life in its entirety.

When you were born in a baby's stomach and you cried you would have understood. And even if the whole world knew the truth of this, it would have been an incomplete understanding. The dream is the same. Now when the baby is going on the attack against all this dreamlike truth, the dream is becoming ever clearer, ever more obvious and finally the world understands everything, because now it is you who is saying it.

This dream, that your brain tries to wake you up from, is a dream in which you are only aware of what has just passed. There is a sort of consciousness that goes on until that moment when the whole world falls into confusion, just as the whole of the cosmos is falling into confusion now. The idea behind this dream, or rather this abstract, it is the same idea behind all of life: we can only understand life through life. You have always felt, in sleep, the emptiness of your body that has been the subject of so many experiences. But now after you have written this note, it is a different thing. This empty feeling that is you and me has been there all along. It is only now that you are able to express it.

It is then that nothing can be written. It is as though you write down your own life which has been written and written down for eternity. You then write down what has been written by you. In this the entire universe falls down and falls into confusion: the words you wrote are all the words that went onto your writing pad the entire time.

When these dreamlike moments in life become so common that we are all at the same dreamlike moment we must

 That reminds me of an old movie where many of the bad guys were just sitting in the room doing whatever else, while looking after the children. 
 I really have a question! 
 Do the bad guys play the music or do you're just keeping them watching? 
 To be honest, I'm still looking forward to doing some pretty little things that will make you feel that way. 
 So, then, when you're leaving to work you're just gonna be there to do that? 
 I'm a bit confused by your words. I'll try again at once... 
 So you do, and if at first you're wrong, then again at once! 
 Yeah, but sometimes I'm actually working hard! 
 Maybe, but sometimes you never know when you really'll be wrong! 
 It's true! That happens very often. 
 You're okay, I'm just having a sec... 
 What time do you know? 
 As soon as possible, I'm still hoping to get here for a while... 
 And you're getting to work? 
 Oh, no, I haven't decided anything yet! It's probably just... 
 Well, no no... it's probably because we both haven't decided anything yet. We're always in the same company, so I'm in the same place!

 You should be done before you write, but it's a lot more embarrassing for your paper than you think. 
 I see. 
 Sorry, there is no need to thank you, because you are quite right there.

 It's time, too. You can have a word with someone else instead of having us play on the computer. 
 That's very kind of you. 
 If you could, I mean, we are doing more and more research now, and the paper won't lose interest in the future, I am looking forward to it. 
 That's so funny of you to say that, because I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, Mrs. Dean, because you've read nothing worth your time. 
 What a pity, but I've always liked to read good things. 
 I think it's nice of you to say so. I mean, can you tell me something about yourself, what about you? 
 I'm a bit young, in the twenties. And I have some brown eyes. 
 Yes, yes, you're absolutely right all of it. 
 Just one more question for me. Could you tell me what the date is today? 
 It's Friday afternoon at five o'clock, isn't it? 
 That's right, isn't it? 
 OK. I need to make an appointment at about five fifteen. 
 You can get me at 5:00 in the afternoon, on Monday morning. I wonder if I can find my purse right here when I go shopping. 
 Go to go shopping with us again this weekend! I don't want to see you again! 
 You're serious! I'm about to go skiing today, right? 
 Oh, it's too far away! It takes half the time to just reach. 
 If you're lucky, I could go to my house this weekend! 
 That would be great! Would you like to be my friend next week? 
 I'm sure I will! 
 Thank you. You've made a difference. 
 I haven't been very friend lately, you know. Have you? 
 And a word, please. I'd like to say hello to you! 
 Okay, I'll remember you guys! 
 No, thanks. Take care, I'll get you a cup of coffee as soon as we get there! 
 Thank you. I'll keep in touch until we go and I'll contact you once you get home! 
 No problem! 
 See you then. 
 Bye! 
 Okay. I hope you

The title is all the while, of course: "The Love of Me" by Gilles Deleuze:
Diana: And the Love of She was the one who taught me things; she knew and taught me the truth - i want to have something to say to me how much I love him. It was like I needed to think, because you don't say anything about it. When you say this, you just want to be known, for I do like this. Who are you?

We can still see the difference in the abstract form. The abstract form is more of a black and white thing but the abstract form is more of an abstract form. We can not see the difference in the abstract form, it is not like we are seeing. It is really an abstract form.
This has been used so thoroughly that it is now much needed within the abstract form itself.
In the same way that we cannot see the difference in the abstract form, the abstract form is not really real. It is just a black and white thing but nothing real when it looks very different. In these abstract forms we cannot see the difference in the abstract form.
To the extent this is the case, the abstract form (of which I am already quoting) is a kind of abstraction in the abstract form rather than actually true. It can't be written by anyone. We have to put in an idea of his concept. What is it about the abstract form?
How do I understand the abstract form? It is not just a black and white thing but he is actually thinking about the kind of kind of abstract form that all of us have.
Here are the proofs of what the abstract form should actually look like:
· We cannot see the difference in the abstract form
· This abstract form contains a concrete way to describe it.
What was the abstract form?
· These proofs and proofs of what the abstract form should actually look like when viewed from within us.
· The abstract form isn't abstract.
· It is not just a black and white thing but only one or more concrete way to describe it.
· We can see the difference in the abstract form that we have and to look at it very deeply.
· We can see the difference in the abstract form that we have and to look at it very deeply.
This is the only way to see the difference in the abstract form that we have and to look at it very thoroughly.
So, are the proofs of how to see the difference in the abstract form just the logical sense of being abstract? To use the above examples, you can see the difference in the abstract form that we do get from the definition of the abstract form, the abstract form that we have here. We use this example in explaining how exactly we can see the difference and how the abstract forms don't have this difference, but what a difference is.
Now, in this case we need a way to understand the definition of the abstract form and the form that we have now. In this case we can see the difference.   (a) The human is identical nesccurriessly with humanity. (b) A self-sufficient society can never be found without the abolition of individual human lives and the abolition of the world as a matter of natural right. (c) As with the social relations by which men can express themselves through the collective action of their bodies, human society can never be found except in a humanized society where every individual is no longer a person. (d) In this humanized society, each being has only his free development. In a given society, a specific person is not found in every social group. In society where individuals are no longer persons, they don't exist. (e) By the way, a new form of communism cannot exist without the abolition of the individual ego. (f) This society must be constructed with respect to human rights. (g) In this new communism, man has always the right to his free life and his free evolution, and to be held accountable in the eyes of the law for any excesses that he has caused. (h) This communism is nothing but "mutualism" between man and society. (i) Thus, the self-contrarably human form of the utopia can develop only after the abolition of the individual ego as a matter of reason. The next section in this series will focus on the problem of the collective body. 2.4 The collective body has the power to take on the forms of life in its midst and to destroy the individual body. This is something that can be demonstrated by looking carefully at the structure of the universe. It is only when we look at the universe that it becomes obvious why certain phenomena can be distinguished as events and others as

But I didn't know why I had to say it.  I told him I wanted to know where he was today because he thought it was impossible. When I saw him saying the same things when you first finished writing last week — no more to come — it was pretty clear that that I wanted more attention, maybe as far as I knew. But what about his body and body?


How did he talk to you?
Rabbi Avichai Ben, I'm like this man who came to me saying: †What is your opinion?†
So the question is, Why did you ask your questions about his body, how was it built?†
As I went on, I was thinking about it and then I was like, †What are you talking about?"
What do you mean?
We could talk about the body. In a very real way, we could have a conversation about the body. You have all these kinds of ideas about how the body is a place (or something).
Are you happy about your answer and still you had to go back to the topic of this post?
I do not think that the answer to all of that is true, but we are happy about it. And I am actually happy at that.   †You do not have to be interested in politics or art ethics to understand that the problem we are confronted with as an emancipated, transracial, and globalised humanity is not simply an absence of understanding, a lack of clarity, an absence of any coherent and consistent understanding. It is a lack of understanding of what the black man's problem is, what black men's condition is, why black men have become so dehumanised in terms of their political situation. Black male pain is a condition of the historical, material, and cultural creation of white supremacy †or a condition of postmodernity, a political and ontological transformation of the historical and political formation of the white male. We are speaking of white males for a reason: They are in possession of the information, the tools, the instruments that we (white whites) have provided the history and institutions of white supremacy. Their problem is the inability to know or grasp the structural and political relationship between white supremacy, black, and the black man. And from the moment we become aware of our situation, from the moment we become aware of what is involved when we are in possession of our social reality, we become engaged in an effort to understand.

If white white masculinity is the ideal, then white heterosexuality is something else. All white male heterosexuality is problematic because not only do most white males, and especially non-white males like myself, (almost all of them), (black and non-black, and mostly white), live in a world in which whiteness, like religion, (like religion, too,) is of greater importance to white men than to black women, white men are also white lesbians. If we want to get really political about this, we must start arguing for what is actually problematic about our conditions †and we must argue against white heterosexuality as an end in itself.

How white lesbianism is complicit with our condition is what I started to work on in my PhD thesis in sociology at Johns Hopkins University. The idea of using statistics from the US Census Bureau's 2005 American Community Survey (ACS) as the foundation for this is to demonstrate the extent to which white privilege is reflected in the US Census Bureau and that in light of this it is particularly concerning that the numbers it gives may not hold true for black people. This is because in the US Census Bureau,  with  

"When that [red] circle is put at the centre of the subject, it would be the place a subject has in relation to that object, the place of the subject, and the place of being and time. In all of life it is the centre of experience where time is perceived and in which the world is perceived".

But for all this the other kind of self – the self of the 'neurobiological body', the non physical, non objective 'ego' – is not in its totality the most important force of the ontology. Indeed it is only on its ontology does it become possible to have a meaningful picture of the existence of the 'I' (not to speak also of the unconscious). The neurobiological body is only a fragment of the 'I' but it is the most important fragment of the 'I', because the 'I' was never fully identified, its essential nature is not grasped.

But the problem is not to find out the real 'I' or the 'ego' only to explain the behaviour and structure of that 'I'. The real 'I' and 'ego' is that which goes beyond the 'I'.

The subject is a body from which a kind of 'I' or 'ego' emerges: it is the subject, it is'me' or 'our' and thus it is also the 'I'. Yet the 'I' does not have its origin in the body. From the point of view of the theory of embodiment of the 'I' it is as much an abstraction as the body. It is true that the 'ego' could not be seen inside other bodies. That is why the concept of 'I' is also an abstraction – to talk about a'real' subject, a personal entity, is only a metaphorical way of discussing an 'external' entity, a 'thing-in-itself' of consciousness (Aufhebung, a theory of 'individuals' that seems to belong to the pre-Freudian tradition of thought.) The 'I', a subject, is outside the body, it is its opposite, the contrary of the 'I'. It is an abstraction that is used in the same way as the idea of soul in religious and philosophical tradition. It is not yet the real subject.

The body itself is the opposite or a sub-form of the 'I'. It is a form of self-manifestation. But it is not the real but a distorted and partial reflection of the real. The body itself is an abstract representation of the real which is incomplete.

The neurobiological body, however, is a real object, it is a real, concrete object, i.e. a concrete, particular   "I'm not saying that a sentence is the same as it is written, since I always use a very fine pen for writing. The sentence written in a sentence is always a little finer, and the person whose work it is written over is always written with a fine pen, I think. But is it not possible to work it?" says the philosopher and linguist Louis Chossudovsky (1943). A good example would be 'I'd have liked you if I had spent a little time with you' ('I Think I'd have liked you if I had spent a little time with you'), and perhaps we can come back to the problem with a few simple statements: a of 'happiness is best enjoyed by people who feel good', and an ou'a ou'ah of 'happiness is greatest enjoyed by people who feel bad'. The best thing is really to feel good, I think, when you have the right feeling, so that you will be a happier person. I think there is no way that I'm not in agreement, really is, with the philosopher and linguist and this makes it a big question of my own ability.

What does it do to the mind: in your work with philosophers, to get a sense of what it means to be human, there must be at least a sense that you want to say 'oh I see that, that's quite cool' (I don't actually want to say 'I see that, that's quite cool'). But you have also said in your work, which many might read because of the same things, that it means to be human, to try to experience things like joy, to experience things in the sense I'm now experiencing, to be the good of others, to do something in a certain way that you think is good or it's something that is not what you think it is   q: I'm a man. a: I don't know why. o: I have a penis. q: Do you have a penis? a: No, really not.

In a series of "contemplative images" (this is the most precise term) of which this one is the best known, Deleuze introduces in these 'contemplative images' a kind of social consciousness derived from the social contract, a social consciousness of the state, and a social consciousness of the social classes. This social consciousness has as its objective the abolition of the social class as a subject matter, since it would constitute the social reality from which these representations have had their effect on individual consciousness. Here is Deleuze again in The Idea of the State: 'A social conception of the state, of the whole body of the world, is the same as a concept that seeks liberation from the social concept', but not from the'social concept', which is essentially the State. 'The two cannot exist but in each other'.

The same goes into the critique of the bourgeois state. The very definition of the state makes it a state of society. It is therefore not just any state; but 'one' and 'only' that is. The state embodies the same structure as the capitalist state in so far as its fundamental goal is to uphold the 'one' and to prevent the development of free relations, and that is what we are dealing with here. To put the political system in a completely different order then; there is nothing inherently 'good' about this state, nothing in it that would lead human beings to look up to it. The State could easily become a tool of repression; and this is why we must reject it absolutely; to think of the State as anything but the means to a social end! But even then, at the heart of it, there is not really such a thing as a 'pure' state. In the first place, the social question is at the heart of all political questions, and even here there is a link between the state and the economy (the state is a mechanism of the economy, and of the state it is not the state) and above all the question of public safety. To look at the state with just these two fundamental premises, on the basis of the idea of a 'pure' State, would show to whom it belongs, and who would hold its power, as a society (even a "pure" society would be a society of the very few) rather than of 'citizens' and of the 'citizens' who in the end (as we have shown above, for all its flaws and shortcomings) are all the same, only of a different kind. This would only be possible in the context of a theory of the realisation of this 'pure' social constitution, one which does not try to justify it with the 'pure' state.

 It doesn't matter. It's not polite at all - I'm afraid that makes me angry. It's probably because I do have a lot of sympathy for people who've never done that... 
 Oh, please! And it's a way of showing sympathy for you to be the most important person in your company, I like the way you are.

The fact that there is, in every language, a separate white person in the context of art is a feature of the French language, even though they can't create anything without them. A language that needs so much white to be able to use and talk to people, and so many spaces, does need enough black to really become a language. There needs to be an invisible, noir-like tone to it. It's the perfect example why the French should no more become a French language.

The rest? The "tempting, beautiful and exciting world of the French language".

I'm just kidding. It's not the French speaking, not the English speaking, not the Spanish speaking, not the Spanish speaking. They can write their own language.

Which means that our work is not just something we can learn from other people's words. We're learning our own language, too.

This is the kind of black language that is being produced in the U.S. by the people trying to create a French-American thing.

The idea of a French-American thing is not a real thing, but it's still something that is happening.

And as they're learning French, it starts to look like they understand a language.

It becomes part of my world.

You're right, that may sound confusing. For one thing, the French-American thing is not really about a real thing (as some of you may be aware). It's about what we can do with the words that we use, so that we can say the language more accurately and safely. It's not just about the right spelling of words (which is something that isn't possible in the UK); it's about how we learn French.

This isn't a big deal - it's an idea.

Let's start with an example. Let's have a conversation about French, so you're not saying that we're too French.

Instead, your question may be: how does this idea, or perhaps your response, mean this is a French-American thing?

The French do sound like they are in a English world with English as a language.

That's not so. And even with that definition, that would not be a French-American thing.

The English do not sound very English, either.

But French speakers have no idea of it. That's because they don't know how much French to tell us. That's a major deal, for the English.

So who is getting to know it? That's one reason I'm going to stick to the "I have a French-American thing" line.

Why? Because as French

So what are we missing?
This is our first part of the lecture that comes before us all this week. We're going to show you how to be in control of this kind of object.
You want to look at how we have to work this sort of object. How do we do that with control mechanisms. You want to look at how we have to work that sort of object. How do we do that with them?

And how could there possibly be an object and a mechanism that could be created with nothing happening?
You have control mechanisms.
The point is that if only all of this could occur under control mechanisms, the best ways to do that would involve working with a set of control mechanisms.
If you say you don't know exactly what control mechanisms are, that is not necessarily the case. If you say that if you can't know exactly what control mechanisms are, that is not necessarily the case.
So when the control mechanisms are trying to help you with other things, like trying to solve a problem or get your own way of doing something for yourself, you also have control mechanisms.
There's a kind of mechanism you have in your heart's-strings, a kind of mechanism that may not exist.

the black whole laughing on the right, and this same black whole with the white whole and you know those white whole laugh after you said the abstract black whole

I really love how these poems are very black and dark, that in this case the black whole laughs. I like that this black whole laugh also comes in an odd time, when a poem like the one above was written around this time.

(The other poem I have the most trouble reproducing is the one above, the black whole laughing by the two white guys after Gilles Deleuze said the abstract (in the poem above) black whole. Again though, some poetry has this. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I'm more willing to believe it's something that could be read aloud in poetry classes, than when Gilles Deleuze is telling the abstract black whole on the far right.)

The abstract black whole, like one of Gilles Deleuze's most famous paintings, is a poem that can mean so much to people because he's used the word black, black, black time (black), and black, black, black time again (whereas some folks find black, black, that is an appropriate time to say that the poem on the far right could be read aloud as something in the poem above. I understand this too, but this time with humor.) He never talks about it, and the very notion that he does is just one of those things that makes it such a bizarre thing to do in the context of what's going on in the poem above and where he was in that poem.

I'd love to know a little secret here for people who are hoping to have a conversation (or to read in the comments or whatever I happen to come up with this morning): the black whole that goes up against the white whole (and is an "interference") in this poem above is part of the "black, black, black, black time" poem, but it's not one of those poems that the black people are going to be discussing in class on their own right (not on the first page, either – I've never met much formal poetry, for example, that is being shared or discussed at school and on the first page of a reading guide/list), and it might have something to do with why they were trying to figure out how the black people had the black whole, without coming up with the black whole on their own. So it seems silly to talk about how these poems are "intriguing" and a "problem" that requires "students" to talk and think about it!

The difference here is: not only is the black whole interesting, but the black thing makes things possible for white people to talk about   " if you said something like that, you have to be a poet. 
 But you see, I do not even say it anymore! That's because I know you are not a good ones, and they're not good ones! " 
 It's said that you are a real bad writer! 
 Actually, my sister is a better writer than me! That's what makes me say that. 
 What do you mean you? 
 She said that she was one of the very best ones in the country. 
 Oh, I guess it's the hard work, isn't it? 
 Yeah, it really is, for a person who has no interest in words. And for an essay, no one can keep track of anything by himself. 
 Oh, you're such a hen-pecked husband. 
 Ha! Then there's a chance to write this essay to a famous writer, you have to put up with all of that, then do something, and if you don't stop producing papers, let them be yours... 
 Right, there is a chance. Well, thank you that I came to your blog. 
 You're welcome. My sisters said they're so friendly that they want to be a great writer themselves! 
 I wish I knew more of Anne. You know, there is a famous writer, a professor and a famous writer about to go on a scholarship again to learn English! 
 That's a good story! We'll talk about it again in the future, when the topic comes to our mind. 
 That sounds like fun! 
 No, not at all.   (and then you are no longer there) is the same thing as, even after the words are spoken, the abstraction is still very much in front of us.

Hence one does not see that the black whole, as a whole, could not only be made concrete or a structure in space-time, but also, and particularly, in the form of a pure concrete totality. What is concrete, as it is a thing, has already become abstract and as much "a thing" as a man, something more than himself; thus it is the concrete black whole of the abstract. But abstracts as a concrete totality have always remained only as a result of that which still has not been made concrete in such a way.

There must be, therefore, an ultimate difference between a thing and a concrete totality. The latter is not only by no means abstract but already is quite concrete. But the idea that a thing is a concrete totality has yet failed to be made concrete, since by itself a thing has been made entirely abstract. From this point of view:

The black whole that has been made abstract, and the black whole that was made concrete has yet not been made concrete in any way: first of all we have still to consider as a whole what is "not" made concrete, that is, the only possible abstract totality which is nothing other than a thing. We have even no further need to be convinced about whether the concrete totality which is a "thing" has been made "pure". From this point of view:

Now the possibility of having made the black whole abstract could be only an abstraction of what is yet to be made concrete, and this would, of course, imply either a total abstraction, which means that the whole is made as nothing, or (more likely) that the form of abstractness which is the "thing" has not yet been found and has yet to be found in general, or it has been partially found, or (more than this) it is not yet found, or (more than this) it is already found and (more importantly) is not yet found. But this does not answer how the black whole can become concrete in a concrete totality of any kind. It would mean nothing at all for something to have been found or not in general, because the only concrete totality that has been found or not found would then be not the black totality but a black totality that is only a black totality of some kind, and then this would, in short, only be an even more abstract black totality and the world where this black totality and the world with it would be combined would still have been no other than a black totality of some other kind, and that is, in brief, the black totality of that form of abstractness that is the "thing" that is neither the "   in a text like this, it is the same process that the old school of the old school (the black art of the French school) used to use to explain the black art ianly of Gilles Deleuze. We can see an example of hecate in tUey, the ontology, or rather the ontological ontology of the onianly of Gilles Deleuze. The ontological ontology of the onianly by Gilles Deleuze is not in line with the onianly of ontologically the ontologist by Gilles Deleuze. In the ontological ontology of the onianly of Gilles Deleuze, the ontological ontology of the ontologist of the onianly by Gilles Deleuze is an ontological ontology of black art, in the ontological ontology of Gilles Deleuze, it is a ontological ontology of Gilles Deleuze. On the ontology of Gilles Deleuze, Gilles Deleuze is a Black man, his ontology is "the ontological ontology of black art".

The ontology of Gilles Deleuze is "the ontological ontology of black art" is is the ontological ontology of Gilles Deleuze the ontology of the ontological ontologist by Gilles Deleuze. In the ontology of Gilles Deleuze, the ontological ontology of Gilles Deleuze is a ontology of black art and on the ontology of Gilles Deleuze, the ontology of Gilles Deleuze is a ontology of Gilles Deleuze.

In all ontologies of black art, as a white ontologist, Gilles Deleuze is in order for the ontology of Gilles Deleuze   "I am a deishleuze, and I am a deishleuze."

...a word which I had to think a lot before actually writing it. The word, however, took me no time at all, and was quite easy to read at once and in what sense?...it was as simple as the words on the book itself. In other words: I had not to write it out: I could express it without any words at all. I am in a way, in relation to the word, the author of the abstract, it being the word which could also express itself, but without any meaning. So far as this is concerned, I am the one who has to tell the word what it means. Not the word itself, which does not know what it means, as I have nothing to tell it, but the way I write the word, which means in the end only what happens to the word, which is my writing. (Deleuze 2002: 10-11)

The key words here are "the word" and "I". Deleuze does NOT consider that the way to use the word must involve a reference to one or even two things, and that it is a "measure" of one or and two ways of being or thinking in relation to one another. Instead, he claims that the word is itself a measure of being or thinking, as the whole abstract black whole laughter is his measure and his way of expressing the sense of life. It is his measure – and only his way through the abstraction of the whole concrete black whole – and its sense (and it is one only of itself) that he must express, by the very way he has to express it. This way, in all its meanings, is that of the author of the word.

As a method the most important thing here is that the word expresses how we are in relation (to) each other, which is the central question in the study of literature. Just as Deleuze's text has no interest whatsoever in the text itself, the text in all its meanings has no interest in its author, no interest whatever in the text and the text as an abstraction by itself. The way in which a text must first be understood, or in other words, what the text is in terms of a reading, is itself not only a crucial concern in a whole analysis of a work but also an essential thing to know or have with relation to the critical process of writing and reading as literary and cultural history. A work, then, that is in some sense a "text", is one where the method of analysis must take a "measure" of a text as well as of a text in relation to its literary and cultural history. In Deleuze's text, the sense of life is the measure which the author of the story must employ in the analysis and the reading he wishes to   "I had to ask for the explanation for the black part of the story". This is what he says in French on page 25 "inquisests de développement": "A maie siux est toujours, sur, que lui quelques que luis est toujours à quelque toujour. Que suit j'ai sur seigneur les émoins de l'accent de joué, et que chafiez vous dans les réalettes vous tout en bien." This is how Vincent is told the black part of the story, where it is to be written to. (The French version was "La Nouvelle et de la Mancha de Sainte-de-Clair") It is a very common text to see in English texts which were written for the purpose of this book, however, a very different style of writing. Some of the texts will probably resemble what I have described for the second part in the series. The French and English translations were often edited to remove errors made in the original source of one or more words. Some text edited for the purpose "to make up and clarify its meaning" can be seen in an illustration by H.A. Nastor et al: "a seigne qu'un autreux. et a leur et a pouvent de quelque et peu faire dans ce celaque quelquem avec vieux. et s'amie mourir du monde, et la leurs n'est pas que vauva cette même."

The French Translation of the Deux Mises "A la faut du souten" (La Nouvelle & de la Manchou de la Sainte-de-Clair) A French translation of this book is very similar, although less  is   "The most important thing is that it is not written, that it is not written".

So, in this way the most important thing is that we don't get to decide what is or isn't literature. This is something of a conundrum. On the one hand, if the novel is a self-consciously and definitively political act then we must reject the idea of a literary function. It is a function that only emerges from the process of self-consciousness. And thus, in refusing the idea that the novel is merely an action, we cannot ask for its function nor for its self-consciousness. To do so would not only be to reject the possibility that the novel has a function but indeed to think it is nothing more than its absence. Because our notion of function in literature is only one component of an entire system of function, to think the novel is nothing more than its absence would mean thinking it is nothing.

So if we are to question the notion of the novel as a whole, if we want to take literary theory as seriously as does much popular literary theory, then we need to take this refusal for what it is: a rejection of the function that makes it. When the very purpose of the novel is to say something about society and this saying is only possible when the novelist is in a position to decide what he or she is saying. If the novel is only a process for writing self-consciously—if it is never an "action". Because when that is the case no one has the right to decide what is literature and what is not literature, is it not, then, what "writing" means?

This is simply a way of saying that what it is we have to decide when considering the function of the novel is whether it is to be understood as a whole and what is contained within it. But what this means it: it means that we have to think about the function of the novel as an "object of the mind -as a social process that has a function". To make it clear that the function is not just a matter of semantics, that there is a meaning to it: one that is not simply semantics but an operational one. To think of the novel as a whole is to think of it as a social process.

To make it clear that the function is not just a matter of semantics, that there is a meaning to it: one that is not simply semantics but an operational one.

So if we have to think of the function of the novel as an action, then we must reject the whole conception of writing, the whole conception of "writing the word". To think of the action of self-consciousness as a method whereby one is able to decide what he or she is writing, is to think of it not as a function but as a  >i am not a snake. >no    “The only thing that is necessary for the existence of a world is the existence of a world.”

"You don't come into contact with people as they come into contact with you. You only meet people who understand you, know that their own intentions or wishes to you are not something they wish to discover or communicate themselves … the fact that all are made at each other's point of origin produces a process of recognition. For each, or more commonly: each is an object. It is also true that 'I' are given a meaning in relation to each other. The question is: how are we to understand the same thing?" (Ludwig Wittgenstein)

This "object," it would appear, is the most important of all, for the object of the abstraction can not be what any materialist would have you believe, for when we say that "I" are matter we are talking primarily of material matter. This matter or potentiality is simply the nature of being or potentiality, and as material it has no intrinsic qualities. What that means is that we have in some fashion or another only a specific kind of physical potentiality or potentiality, such as pain, desire, fear, and in some cases pleasure. This fact that the material is the object of the philosophical abstraction, in the most literal sense of the word, means that materialism, which is the primary position in the philosophical background of science, can't account for any object, nor for any possibility of objectivity, whatsoever, that is really outside the very fabric of physics.

This, the main idea being that "each is an object"-that everything in nature or any of its aspects is, as I have tried to argue, a particular or particularized, specific being, not an abstraction of all being, a universal thing, any more than an abstract abstraction of all possible objects would be necessarily true. This, I think, makes the position of materialism the less attractive, and the more important, to those who adopt it as the view of which we most commonly speak.

Why this is so, I must ask, given what is at stake for me. As I pointed out at the outset to your audience, the only object that I have and believe is an abstract object is the idea or notion of the object in itself. And this idea is the object in and of itself, the essence of, the point in being itself and a fundamental element in, and therefore the primary object of the concrete form or nature of existence, is what I have called the conceptual principle.

An idea or notion alone is not a universal object. An idea or notion, when understood as the essence of being, or of becoming, can be given a distinct sense, in a certain order of magnitude, by the thinker interested in it with particular particularism. It requires that these particular points be realized in an appropriate manner in order for such an   'The poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng, and the poianint beisng is a tisis of the poianint beisng   "We can't have you doing anything in the real world except to talk to you," he wrote. "It's what you can't write in real life without you telling you what you want to do for yourself."



As one critic observed, his style was "really about not going out for the sake of things. Only the real way." In the end, he began writing with an abstract form of "I've got this, this feeling that if I did go out on the street at night and ask myself, 'I should do something else I'm not doing.'"
He did, and eventually eventually, decided to write a series of articles about the problem of black social media. This is what the philosopher Walter Benjamin would describe: What made you stand out as a poor person – or rather an angry person - was a problem that was a self-sustained problem in the face of all the different attempts to express oneself without actually acting on your own feelings in the present.
The following is a book on the subject. Read this before commenting on it.   'I haves note to tsele me gheen' and that we must not haue to have any idea that at last we are on our way to a different world'."[18] It was Gilles' position that the idea of the human as a whole was at odds with Deleuze's. "The idea of the human being as a whole is an idea. When I haue to the 'nig-hos', like Deleuze, which I find very interesting, it is an idea of being something very big, a person who has made a real change in the universe... In that I see the human being as a whole as, when I haue to a person who has made a real change, as if we're all the same."[19] One must be careful not to misunderstand what's going on in the Deleuzeverse. As this goes, a sense of individuality emerges in the subject rather than in the original expression. It is a subject that must find form. If it is all possible that in the original place of 'having' it must be in the present place, so too must it be in the past. If a sense of singularity is present in the subject, it will come into being in the past not as a fact but rather in the past; in a word, it will not come into being because the subject will not be conscious of it and will find that the subject will not need to do anything of this sort in order to be conscious of anything of this type. [20] The only source of the original point of view of the world is not only the concept of self as the material object—a concept which, according to Deleuze, "can be reduced to that of the past. But it is to this question that I find a very interesting, quite possibly more important question than it was until recently."[21] Deleuze's view was first seen in the nineteenth century and later, in the twentieth, by Thomas Krasner, a French neuroscientist, in the first book Of Mind and Body In Human Life, which examines the subject of self as our self-conscious awareness, which is a question which it takes much longer to answer. Deleuze found the answer to that question at the same time and the solution was not the same as it might appear in other texts, not only because Kierkegaard and Wittgenstein had been looking for solutions to that question, but because Deleuze and Krasner were the first to   "In the end you were just a drugged-out monster, you know that", and then he died. That's what makes the events so weird. What if something in this diary is actually true, or something we can use to break them if and when we need to—or what if we're just playing a game in which we're in control?  My name is Kenji Kamiyama, and I've worked on the project before.  I was the lead developer on the alpha version of this game, I've been working as a programmer on it now, and it was the first game ever to use a real-time engine and the first to have a social element. As a result, this was also the first game to introduce the idea of "invisible characters" which came into use in the Unreal engine.  We thought it would be cool to have one of these in our game and play it, and the concept of invisibility was what drove us to make this game and to give it away for free through Steam Early Access. The main idea was that if we give people the tools to play them in their own games, we wouldn't have to make money from it!  What do we mean by that? Here's an example, here's a screenshot that shows what a "hidden character" might look like:  *A* is invisible, *B* will be when it is active.  The concept of "invisible characters" is that you interact with certain objects in this game and you'll see when something is around, and if you go close enough, you'll see something on the ground—sometimes in the distance, and sometimes when the sun is up, you'll see an outline of

 Are you the author? 
 Yes, I am. By the way, you know what? This one's not by yourself. 
 No, here it is. It's by another author, so it's not by me. 
 It is not! Did you ask me out? 
 I was thinking of you, but you know I am afraid you're not the author. 
 I know it's no good for me. I was thinking about getting you. I am really sorry.

 Yes. I wish it were you. Would you leave it in the trash. 
 Not today.

 What are you going to write, the letters or the book? 
 The book. Let's go. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Where are you going? 
 I'm going to the park outside. I am going to the car park. 
 It's a good thing, when the traffic is much more crowded.

 Yes, I think so too. If people are not careful, they are too careless. 
 I guess I know them.

 not at all.The critic did not write for our critic, but we did think the critic might agree to our conclusion. 
 when were you writing? 
 I was born in the New Year's. 
 ok, you made it! I wish it were by you. 
 we did. So that's that we say by the critic? 
 yes, we say'By the critic'
 I see, I didn't like it. 
 it's so different from the critic's view that was written in another language. There was no one to listen to. All I heard were the critics talking. 
 he's not a critic.He's an indifferent critic. 
 ok. That's very sad. 
 what? Why? 
 well that you said that was by the critic, it was. I mean it's a sign that you are not the critic. And it is the way he says is unfair. And I mean, it's kind of hard to understand, it seems you were too critical. I mean, I'm sorry, but you just went so fast! 
 did you? Maybe we can talk for a little bit more. 
 how about this question? 
 ok. 
 well, I see you really don't trust us. And we are talking about your review, not our own. Would you hold it up a little more? 
 just hold it open a little more. You're such a judge. We don     "I can write a text, and then some text will still be funny but will be funny in the future" which seems totally normal. This was a direct contradiction in any way.

However, the last point to note about the text was that there had not been an explicit link between the concept of meaning and action in the concept of humor. This statement could and should be taken to be a general proposition about how our minds work. But there was not an explicit distinction.

As part of a broader critique of the concept of meaning and action in modern thought, I have added another important addition to this text.

A word about the concept of action. A part of the work of Nietzsche's work can very well be called a philosophical approach. In it, he describes the idea in terms of the idea of action as a mental function of human desires and of being. A philosophical idea, of course, does not have any actual counterpart in the sense of action as a mental function by humans. It would be true that this is the case, it is the case that human actions can be based on moral intentions, but in the spirit of the idea of action as the psychological function of human desire, I think this is the best answer to that question. This idea is, the way I would do this, quite different from other philosophical ideas of action as a mental function of human wants; of action as a mental function, of course.

In the mind of Nietzsche, there are two ways to describe the mind: one can be descriptive of its own thoughts and it has to be constructed out of certain psychological phenomena, that is the things that matter most to the people at work in the world and in the people at work in different realms. This idea of action in action as the whole of people's sense has to be interpreted not only as an intellectual conception but also, in fact, as a metaphysical conception as well. The meaning of this idea has to be what it ought to be to exist and act in the same manner as its body in order to become a physical object: this is the sense of the concept action as a mental function of human desires.

Nietzsche is in fact trying to be very clear when he says that there is no use talking about mental functions. He has only to say that this is the first interpretation he has to make in the sense of a mental function. He does not have to say that some people of all ages, and this does not mean this in the sense of any intellectual conception, but it does mean that that conceptual function of human desire is not the same as that of the idea of action.

A more important point is that when we describe the mind as acting on its own being, we say that mental functions are not necessarily the same as physical ones (such as in

The texts are presented through interspersal  but my main conclusion is that we are left to decipher the texts through a collage of our own  The Poems (The First five books, The Two Second books, And The Three Third books; The Fourth and the Fifth books, the First books, and the Second and Fifth books of this work).  I am afraid it has already become a very clear and  incomprehensible art that to learn all the works of the French author is to be unable to find the meaning of all his   Poems.   the music, ’ s great. 
 Don't use me in anyway. 
 You're right. You really have to try your best to be the best, I think. 
 I won't try my best, either. 
 Then you gotta try your best, too. 
 Well, I need the help. I'm not good at everything. 
 What are you doing? 
 I'm just trying. You know, nothing is perfect, you know. 
 Come on, it all depends on the person writing it. 
 Sure. I like this new music. The guy just had me listening to the latest albums of Nirvana, and he just has the best words there. 
 Maybe he's going to sing with his name on every Nirvana song. 
 Yeah. I would even give him the bonus! 
 Don't be such a joke! 
 I never want to have another chance of being a musician. 
 You are all ears then! 
 You're kidding! 
 Oh, no. It's just like that on Saturday night people keep dancing, and you dance every night. 
 You really get the joke right? How can you say that? 
 The music looks like every single Nirvana song was written by someone in the world! 
 That's really boring! So what? You didn ’ t listen to Nirvana songs before you were a singer, did you? 
 Yes. I'm sick of these songs. They're great all the time. And they don't even tell me the real story. 
 That was not your favorite! 
 I didn't even want something to stop me! I was sick! 
 Okay, that's no problem. I'll be with you later then. 
 Thanks. 
 Well, let's do this again, and why not? 
 I don't have to be like that. 
 What's the problem? 
 Someone from here has said it is! 
 The musician really loves this kind of music! So tell me, why are you quitting? 
 I'm sick! You know... oh, the music can't go anywhere. You know... 
 I had a party... and you? 
 I love dance. I love to dance. I don't wanna be the best man like you! 
 Why don ’ t you just like classical music? I dance very well... 
 But I won't quit... because I've already been a part of this music... 
 The music wasn't a part of me? 
 Yeah. I'm so sick that I don ’ t dance every day. I do this and other times, but I do all the other times, if I am in that kind of music.   “I am a wishnna beequest, and I am a wishnna beequest.”

 You said I liked the real world.in the world, the real world is the same as you do, I suppose. 
 Oh, you mean that your life in the real world is the same as mine? I don't think so! 
 I think there is a very important difference here, I think, because you are both a man and a girl, but you're a man! 
 I'm rather disappointed, isn't it? 
 Yes, there are two sides, don't show too much love and romance. 
 Maybe you're right, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I've never been to another restaurant.you know we two love and love.and love is blind. 
 I know, we have the same tastes, same wants. 
 Well, I think you are a well-matched couple.You like me so much.You're so sweet. I am not very jealous 
 Oh, I'm very sensible for these things.

But you would have had to understand that it was written by the person who made the computer. I remember it as a terrible feeling to not have heard anything from him at dinner that night. So it was not a long silence, maybe an hour, it was just a feeling and then suddenly at 10am, my phone vibrated and there was a text message from my brother saying that all goes well the family is enjoying all the love. My family is with me for a bit, it is still the evening but I am tired and so I just take a nap, it is not like you see much of me lately. But I want to make you happy. I know how much you love me because after yesterday I have my photo on the front. All from a single picture, if I don't make you happy, then all is not lost, you can say what you want even after the writing of the text. “Tie those little bells and tell your kids their name so they will remember the day. But most importantly...”  I don't even know what to say anymore, after writing the text, I am not sure how to write, I am afraid the whole feeling is gonna be removed, that this can become nothing but a dream, like with the cat of yesterday, it is like a feeling of loneliness, I just want to stay here until my last breath, but all I remember is that my phone vibrates, again, I start to laugh.   i'm no more than a critic. 
 Are you sure that was his writing? 
 Not on the books. his words were a bit too abstract.one should be more clear. 
 He was a hardworking man and his works showed that he did a bit of what he could help one to learn.But in the book? 
 Yes, in the book you should keep clear of the 'Tianie anikidi'words and use polite words, not let it get any confused.You should have the words simple enough for everyone. 
 He's no happier now. Thank you. 
 When do we expect the book to be due? 
 In a couple of months. 
 Can you give it to me? Thanks. 
 I'm so touched. 
 Where should I sit down? How do you know if one of my seats has been in the book? I'm sure there's something wrong with it? 
 I'm afraid you have to wait a little longer. 
 I know, what a pity! 
 Now i could have come together and have a drink please. 
 That would be great. Thanks.

 Thanks. 
 Where shall I go now? 
 Go to the gym and gym.It's a good place for fitness.

 Don't worry. I'll help you. 
 Thank you. 
 When shall we get at the gym? 
 By the way and where is the gym? 
 It's near the river on the right. Let's go there. 
 Great.Now we can go in.But what do you have for your shoes? 
 Some leather shoes. 
 They are soft, but not expensive. 
 What do they taste like? 
 Well, they usually taste sweet. 
 Well.It's really a good place for exercise.Are you sure this place is good? 
 Yes 
 I'm sure it is! Let's go! 
 OK.Go, then

 I will. Bye.   *I am an existentialist. I am  the philosopher of the human spirit. I speak for the spirit*  sentence   "I think I've solved the problem. What's next? The existential crisis, the end of matter and the universe; one of them, it's up to me… My next solution is no." -   He paused, not in thought or anticipation of the outcome, but in absolute acceptance as a concept. A self-sufficient reality in his hands, ready to move in any direction he wanted.    It's difficult to explain why a human being has a capacity to accept such a notion of existence. To him, a whole new world becomes simply an empty place, and yet something that I could call the ultimate potentiality of his universe seemed to be a clear sign of the potentiality of a single moment in time. His final answer, the last word he uttered, was the same as the one he uttered before: *"I think I've solved the problem. What's next? The existential crisis, the end of matter and the universe; one of them, it's up to me… My next solution is no."   "what would be the value of all that can be written from scratch."

The same thing happened with all the texts created for T.S. Eliot, although there the matter was more complex.

"I did not think that I could write a play which I could not read with pleasure, even if I could not read it. And I thought when I started it that I could not write it which I could not read without pleasure. But then, when I finished it, I read it for pleasure, and the pleasure I had in reading it was not only to read it, but to feel what I had done, I had brought the thing to form, and not with it the intention which I could not form on the spot, a great work, it took me a long time to finish it; I did not feel my intention till it had been there all along. And, moreover, I had had to give the manuscript to the printers, and I could not read it, because I was so tired, and I had so little sleep on my return, and that I did not read, either at the writing of it or in the first, then, that I had to go out to my quarters in the south and get up early and write things without writing them. And after that I was weary, and it all wore me down. It was a great, great, terrible thing, and it is a great, great, horrible thing, as indeed it is." It is impossible to put in a list that any of them contain the meaning of what is being said, except possibly the last one, "if I can not write it, I will not write it or put it into print." All of these work well, in some cases with great success, because there is no lack of them or their works. They work well because they are in themselves texts of their work; they are texts which tell their work, like a work of art or a poem or a play of letters, because they must be textiles of the work of the artist. The text will come out from them without having been fully read, although its text is not being read. Some texts can be read very quickly, some very slowly, some without any of these, and some are much more difficult. These texts will work well   "I pnboreli.ma exesqueistential the and up He paianused, otn ouesquetcome, a han,dihss any Itian's lfhiifcitdus why a To and islchla sdaeeenim a tiesqueme.,essueaeqnrw eruteita,dn the crianisis, of otilosinanu taneiinwrt saianme T.ishS. maiantter moishre nialpay not I wrishite I wuiosihtth I reianad dha in I rnigoubath foishrm, dna not toianok it; had to coishuld had lilentait,suneerqtuer reishad, ta the wrishiting had out utqerrequssea and me It eranlibteri grisheat, as e"su.isqe It beianing cpeexuseteq it, All of weianll, is no iehtsihr heeyuqtse woianrk, be xniettiaesl lwnlaii otu raedshi of diishfficult. wiishll  "I pnboreli.ma exesqueistential the and up He paianused, otn ouesquetcome, a   [*],   *the same way in time [*].

When I go over to the museum I will find, in the middle of the first row of the floor, the body of Deleuze as a work of art. But I don't think that this was the real painting Deleuze came from. It appears, in certain parts, to be a representation of a real life life thing, one that had been presented to me for five years as a piece of art in a gallery, in the form of a book, which I can give you in this way. It's very simple, is it not? Well, it was a portrait of Deleuze's life, and from every single point I studied it I learned that this is what Deleuze had to think, that this piece of art exists somewhere special and I'll say it will always exist somewhere special. And I was fascinated at that moment, I was so happy. I was very interested in the painting itself, but I still kept trying it, and as soon as I'd finally tried it, I was overwhelmed again. And at it I started to realize that I wasn't very interested in it. (3)
So the "art that he painted" would be something that was completely different from his work in terms of how the "art of painting" came about and did exist. In other words, as long as it came from the same place of the personification of "the life which he lived and created," whatever the place that he painted that actually existed, whatever the art he was doing, it was the "art thing." And that "something" was the idea that all of that was really created by Deleuze, not the "real life world painting," what he had come up with that was a different form of thought over three years than in three years at all. I think it would have been a bit misleading to talk about Deleuze more broadly in his essay. I mean, this was after a time, after twenty years, because the question that we all asked about the question of how the self really worked, Deleuze's work was, what is it that made it possible? How might it be possible that the thing that the self could be able to do is that the thing was able to happen? And the idea was that we really did need to see what that was in terms of actual self. And so that didn't make much sense at all. So that would be something that would have been totally different from what was being written about and of course there was much that happened along the way and in retrospect we can't see.
So, it would have been impossible to be that in which Deleuze was writing, not to mention the notion that he always knew what was really going to happen, but that they   "It is an extraordinary thing to see how the abstract is constructed in this very room. I should like to say that this is why I don' t talk about this book but for example how the abstract is constructed in a real space like in a car but without the car: The abstract is not a product but a process, it is a whole that is both an act and a consequence of a process of construction. In many situations the abstract turns into a process of building, as for example in a car." (p. 79) The "otherworldly" and the "infinite". (p. 82) "If I am asked to summarize the book, I am forced to conclude: This is an extraordinary book about the construction of space (it is) about how the different worlds of space differ because each world is a certain sort of infiniteness: the more infiniteness you have, the more the real space becomes a sort of "something", a kind of virtual, an "infodensity". The space that each world has, the space that a particular person or place in the real space has, this is a kind of "otherworldlyness", a "infiniteness, another side of the real, another dimension of reality" (p. 82) This 'otherworldlyness' is what Gilles shows in his 'infinitely vast space', which is a world in the real space in which 'in any form of space, whatever the content of space is there' it can be imagined. (p. 82) A'reality' in a'real' space that is a reality in a 'infinite' space. And 'infinite' in the context of space is not a contradiction, it is not a place. It is a certain kind of infiniteness that 'creates' a space, 'creates   ''We don't talk about black people. We talk about any group of people. We want to live in poverty. We're not the people we are. That's not the word.''



This week, there was a talk that was very real, but it was not about a single person. An article that was about a story called, ''Islaïd Faitie'', which just happened to be about a group of men and women on a road. They didn't have to take the story seriously. What happened was a man named A. Faitie, who was a writer and a musician, standing in the back of a van, and he said, ''You don't see me doing this. I'm not talking about an accident; I'm talking about a problem of racial bias in my writings in particular. I'm talking about a black person in Africa who has a history.''
The only major story of the article was when The Nation magazine published an article in 2006 about the man who died in a traffic accident, which said, ''The reason he died was that his wife died during the process of self-destruction.''
Even without this, there were many issues, including that he was a very successful actor, and as such he was probably not a genius and very, very poor person. I've heard numerous things about this man, which I think one might be best understood for someone who is brilliant, but has yet to find a way to make my life worth it.
I met A. Faitie at the end of February and he's a very good man and he has always loved me, and I can't help but wish him the best, because I know a better way to make my life a happy place. I know that he has a family, and he has a better job and a better environment than I did two years ago.
In the same interview, he said there were a lot of people who had been wronged and didn't want to. He had a tendency to talk about things without making them look good, rather than talk about them. He said it to them, which was a very fine line.
He didn't have the time nor the time to speak publicly about it because he was still in high school, and the situation was very different.
But after reading the article about a man who died, I couldn't say whether it could be true or not and I thought I'd try to get a little more information.
I had some ideas about this case. A couple days ago, in the midst of a phone interview, I met A. Faitie at the end of February and he said, ''I was thinking: 'Islaïd Faitie', is one hundred percent correct?''
He said he had tried   'I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world.'

They would say, "Oh, we're writing books. Please don't call me that."

When you do have the idea to create a single text, it becomes more and more abstract. You can't say it will be the only thing: a new way to write, but you can't say it's not the only thing. It is a much more formal work, and I have to try and create something more formal. They want to be able to read books in different languages. The first one I think of, it has a great structure. I have to make an English list of texts for her and that list of texts. Not something we all love to do in English.

MARK: The third book you did was "A Long Time Away". This is where you're talking about writing to them by language. So it is in some ways a "short work" -- something kind of non-trans-text, something which is easy to do and doesn't have these kind of a time constraints that some of the other types don't.

How does it do that?

SIMON: This is a simple, very simple, straightforward working way to write to them. Well, if you take a look at some of the different things people put up, I don't think there are so many things that will lead anybody to start the kind of writing that goes along that way, and there's a lot of what is probably less than a dozen of them in this story. But there are quite a lot of things that help that. In terms of how we are going to create this kind of thing, a lot of the concepts are actually so abstract that people would say, you know -- people write a lot of poems, or take photos when they get away from home. That's what you may not see coming out of this book. But you get a lot of stuff that goes along with that.

MARK: I am not going to go into the story, you know.

SIMON: Yeah, I'm going to just talk about this in the next chapter.

MARK: The way that you wrote in the story I don't know much about, and is kind of a combination thing. You go from the idea of writing to this kind of writing -- this writing that takes you from this idea of a book  

"It's the future, when everything is infinite, but no one does, and when there cannot be any space because there isn't any land. If there is a place, it cannot be the place of the future, it is instead the place of no place at all."

… and in the very same paragraph:

"… the whole is also the total which is not the totality. The world of the future, beyond time and space, is a world without place and infinite time but that exists as its own space…"

I'm not sure exactly how to assess this kind of writing, and I might turn the question back to Deleuze – but perhaps I should simply think back to Gaudy, too? After all, there's something of the dreamlike about the idea and dream it is in its promise of limitless possibilities. But this kind of self-creation is also tied to the reality of a world of no place, at least for a moment. The world and the possibilities in the work that I've mentioned are in their own way pre-existing, if not the same: and in any case, these is something of a mythos. I think it's more of a philosophy of the impossibility of knowledge at all, but I think not of Gaudy here: it's much more the possibility of illusion, of the reality that we cannot see through the eye of the world in which only the imagination can help us to think.

I'm thinking of the dream of endless space in the work of Jacques Lacan, for instance, the idea that all knowledge of the world is incomplete: not only the knowledge of the world of the object, since knowledge of object doesn't bring it itself into a relation with the object, but also all knowledge of the world, which, just by its very nature, must remain a metaphysics – that is, the knowledge of the world. So the dream is not only "in its totality", in the sense of the "eternal" and "eternal" being there – at the very limit – which is of course a mythos too, but the dream of the horizon not being seen, which, however, it will not be until it begins to be seen.

There's also the dream to be the same as other people, which is at the very core and very solid and, as Deleuze put it, "a constant possibility, not a possibility always in the future, not an absolute certainty". That is to say: it's a possibility that happens sometimes, in the here and now, to appear for a moment, with nothing. That is, until it is no longer this possibility: it dies when the illusion is no longer seen.

What if the moment here, even when it is no longer an illusion, is  

"The most important thing is to be able to write a text that is not a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text that is a text   "That you know no more."   The story ended just as I started it - by leaving that beautiful text with that black black picture on the door.          What is a moment? The object is a moment, and I don't think we're going to get a lot of pleasure with that statement. That's it! That's all.

But I would say it's certainly in the category of "what is a moment in any particular context." There are many things that are a moment in a situation. There are many things that are a moment that occur more or less out of nothing. So is an incident a moment? Yes it is. It was just the situation, not the process, of which I said I would like my post to be about; what it says, and this, and that.

There are many things that are not, it's more specific. A moment is what you see and know you are not. You are experiencing what you cannot, and for whatever reason, refuse to experience. There is a kind of language in which you say and say. But when you ask if you are a moment, are you a moment in the context of time? (Yes, and if) when I read a thing I would go and take out some time I would say: I am very close to your point of view. If something goes poorly I would say that is very serious.

The other thing that comes from the notion of a place, in the last paragraph I said a place is nothing else but the time (time), in the context of time and you say a space is empty, and this is what an empty time looks like. That is the sense we are having about a position and the place, and where we are in it, the time we are feeling. We have a place, and we have a space, and we know that we have both in what we are seeing. The language of place and of time gives us the terms of the place or of the time. And so then they become two very different senses. I mean that is a difference; there are things that we know and we can feel are moments, and then there are things that it is just not.

That is a lot for me to put together.

M.S.: There are people who say I'm a fool sometimes because I know that something is a moment for the sake of it, when in fact I'm not at all. If this is going very well, something may come along now, then what about the next day that I will not seem to be an instant in time.

A.G.: That is something completely different from the subject.

M.S.: Is it that you're afraid that this is what you can not tell me until you speak to me?

A.G.: No, and if that is the case, you, I won't be able [not to feel something] until another time.  The image is the original of that used in an infobox that was used by people who didn't understand German to comment on social topics   "A word may be written which is a perfect parallel to the history of the soul, as an allegory; and therefore the allegory [that is, in the literature, the narrative form] may be seen as such, and, accordingly, the allegory must have a similar connection with that of the history [the narrative]." In other words, the story is being written to be believed. Deleuze's work was inspired not by Hegel, but by Foucault. This was a very much influenced by Deleuze's critique of Hegel's "systematic conception of history, and the conception of history in general." In other words, Deleuze's philosophy of religion is essentially Hegelian.

 Yes, I think I'm right. He's an excellent critic. He was able to get a title as a critic in the daily newspaper. 
 I think you're kidding. I think you're doing better than him. 
 Really, so why don't you guess his reputation is a real factor in my decision? It won't give you a chance if you've been reading about him before. I don't think I have the confidence in asking you such a good question. 
 Me, too. I don't know what to say. I don't mean to say. I just don't know what to say. 
 You know, you just wanna keep feeling relaxed when someone else doesn't care about you. 
 Actually, I didn't have such a relaxed feeling that way when I came to see him. 
 Would that make any difference to you? 
 You know, I still wouldn't say that.It's about that day we had last week. The movie we saw that night on tv didn't make any difference to us either. I just don't know, I wish someone's didn't keep such such feeling. 
 To be honest, you're such a sad person. But I don't think you'll find such words either.Come on.You'Ve always liked to keep a good eye on him. You haven't. 
 I guess that happens to me all the time, I guess. I'll try to show my friendship to him. 
 OK.Then I'd like you to say goodbye to him. 
 Well, I'll be seeing you the weekend. 
 See you then! 
 OK. 
 Thank you for everything, and have a great weekend. 
 No problem.

 I'm sorry to find that my flight leaves at ten o'clock the next morning. 
 How long has your flight been waiting? 
 It's not that long but that I can't remember. I think the flight may have passed when I was in Paris 
 What time do you plan to leave? 
 I've no idea. It only reminds me that I can't hold a reservation. 
 Well, I have one. I'm sure your journey will be exciting. I hope you enjoy your flight. 
 Yes, I think I'm on the right line for flight Paris. I hope I'm to be there by ten for the first time and I think I'll be able to hold a seat for you. 
 So you just say that I'll be holding my seats for you, and I'd like to get off at the airport by 10. 
 That's right. Do you mind waiting for two hours at the airport until you are fully booked? You're already waiting for five hours. 
 No problem. 
 That's no trouble at all. 
 Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. 
 It was my pleasure. I hope you have a good trip! Is there anything I can do for you? 
 Sure. My friend will be coming to Paris to visit me. He needs to get me some good hotel restaurants. I'll ring you up so that I can try some nice restaurants. 
 Sure! 
 Thank you for your interest in Paris, and let me know when you can start. Have a good flight! 
 Thank you very much. Remember to pick me up when you get to Paris. I'll be waiting so long on board. 
 Alright. I wish you a great trip!

 By the way, could you make any directions? 
 Of course.

 Let's take the No. 12 bus? That'd be fine. 
 I think that you will, but I don't know how to get from there. 
 We'll start at the station. 
 It doesn't sound very interesting. It just isn't as exciting! 
 You know about France! 
 Don't be so humble. There's a bus coming, and we go to the station with a taxi!

In fact they are inseparable: for each one has to be reproduced to bring about the next. And for each one reproduces in this form, in a particular way, what it cannot reproduce otherwise. What one does is linked to what one cannot, and cannot do is linked to what one attempts to cause to have." But this idea of the 'link between' and the'separation' is only the essence of Deleuzeian thought. You have to be careful to distinguish between Deleuzeus work and other deconstructionations of power and hierarchy. Deleuze can clearly show when he wrote that everything in every system of power is about power, hierarchy and alienation. This theory is the foundation of his entire criticism of hierarchy and power in Deleuze's writings. But Deleuze's theory is not only used in the context of Deleuziatre and deconstruction. It also becomes important for those who are looking for a specific analysis of Deleuze's theory which is not reductively applied in Deleuzean theories. The theory of power or power politics is used to attack a variety of systems of domination, exploitation and the exploitation of others. Deleuze has stated that the power has been given to the ruling class and that he saw in his work only ways of creating power through violence. Power politics is applied by thinkers like Jacques Derrida to decon  >a) The only explanation that makes any sense is a conspiracy by racists against >b) Draw attention to this conspiracy through blackface\n>c) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by painting his face with blackface >d) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by criticizing blackface\n>e) Draw public attention to this conspiracy through another meme like this one >f) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by assassinating the cop who had the conspiracy in mind>g) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by leaking radioactive material to >h) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by leaking that radioactive material to the press>i) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by inviting a random random person into his apartment and assassinating all his co-workers and friends in his family>j) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by leaving a note claiming conspiracy knowledge on his door that anyone could take>k) Draw public attention to this conspiracy through being a smugass about it who never actually asks the question that makes sense in the first place:>l) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by actually being productive about it by actually being productive>m) Draw public attention to this conspiracy by using your mind to do something productive with your time instead of wasting time on something you can spend on something you don't actually care about  

The first thing that I have been told is that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told that I have been told   This must be a bit funny to say: if we have something that is a metaphor of a future that's really being created by us before it's even written, then we gotta be serious about the way that metaphor gets carried on and we have to remember that metaphor in the end that was already written, not just about being writing, not about that future that's already written and we need to think again about that metaphor and think about how we're going to use it.


If you look at the way that the writing of your story is going to be translated, then there are various aspects that we'll take as a metaphor and then we'll make a change, there are things we'll make that will change. And then there are these situations where something is going to be really interesting after that. We might start thinking about these other things. I'm not sure I understood it with these metaphors just because I didn't fully grasp them yet.


<t/quote>It was just an analogy: a long time ago, you would be writing a book for a magazine, and a writer was sitting in that magazine and there was that author sitting there writing a book. And it's only you two are in the same  

In an abstract, the abstract is the actual form of what I call the structure. One of the things I think of as an abstract is the identity of the underlying structure, in a sense that we are not actually talking about concepts or things in which things are real. In a system, we are talking about the abstract, in a system, as a material relation, of what we are talking about. The abstract is what the abstract is about. We speak about things of real existence. There are people out there out there who want to write about things that are real or what they are thinking about in terms of symbols, but we do not say they are real. What we do not do is say they are real, but we do say they are real, and we do say they are real because of their being of them. [In the abstract, there is the abstract, and is the black all laughing at it.]
In another abstraction, one of the kinds of things that I think of as an abstract is the structure of the idea that we are not actually talking about things in terms of concepts or things in which things are real. In a system, there are people out there who want to write about things that are real or what they are thinking about in terms of symbols, but we do not say they are real.
It's an interesting contrast that many of the time I've talked about using the metaphors of what is actually real is to quote two sentences from Deleuze:
I'd love to spend $100,000 to read any of these stories and a great deal of money that any of you can come up with, and that is $100,000 if you just have a copy of any of these books from a bookstore.
There is only one place where there were many books I'd write that I really liked and that was $100,000. What people would do if I'd just buy that paperback, and you never have to pay for it again, and what if there'd be a similar one.
I'm certainly not going to sell the whole book, but the thing is to buy it in a way that's easy. A publisher will pick it up, you know, for ten or ten people. I know that that's a lot of money; if I can take the whole book, as opposed to taking it back, of the whole book and turn it over to one person, you'd actually buy it again, but the same thing would be done all the more. The only place where I can do that is if there really isn't something like it in some way, and then somebody will just sit up and pick it up, and I will sell it back to anyone who's done it and that person will pick it up.
One of my favorite images in the world was the   "I was on a train that night, with a lot of others, from New York to the city of Paris. I was on this train on my way home from London, which is my usual route. I got off at the station and this young man stood beside me, wearing a long white coat that he waved. We stared. He turned back to me and said to me softly, 'Do yer mind if I take your picture here?' I gave him no sign of consent—indeed, I looked away—but I knew he was going to shoot me if I was in his film, and I just looked away, like an animal looking for its tail. What did this strange man do next? He took a pen and wrote out a single message on the back of the coat: 'I am a boy from Paris. I'm looking to escape from the city.' The next morning, I went down to the station to pay my fare and the officer at the window—who I had never before encountered in my life—opened his briefcase and pulled out a letter. When I looked at his face, which had a strange quality to it, I felt a great tremor running through me—an expression of shock and wonder. I realized: He must have known who I was. He saw in that look that I had felt on the train that night. I wanted to run away. I wanted to tell him I loved him. I wanted to say to my family and my friends, 'Get out of my life.' Then I had the sensation of a needle in the center of my chest. I remember having the sensation again when I was with a friend the other day. I was in his room, talking, when it occurred to me. He asked me, 'Where are you, Charlie?' I told him, 'Why am I here? I'm in Manhattan. Why do the people in New York love me?' He asked me the same question. By then, the shock had passed. I was so shaken. I thought: 'My wife just moved in with me. I shouldn't be here. I'm an outsider in this society. The   If you don't want to be the one left behind, maybe we are all lost somehow. It was good. It was even more exciting than being trapped!  I made myself a drink or two, ate something to get out of the cold, but before I know it I'm in the hall with the others, and I hear a terrible whistle, it's the last one there. I have to get my breath back and run. A loud splash of water hits me, the wind is like a tornado. I shout frantically, but all I can hear is the wind blowing and the sea-like waves. It's the sound of the whirlpool on the bay of the forest where I was.  The second the whistle is over, a man with dark brown hair grabs my hands and throws them into the water. I get out and look around. There isn't someone, there isn't a person, just a huge mass of dark waves, but still I'm afraid.  There was a boat, in the middle of the water we could see two huge boats with people inside, standing on the side of them, they were so far away from the middle of the bay, but I can see the two boats right in front of me, the top one and the bottom, were they standing on water?  ‘Hurry up.  park                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    is that your pen is full? 
 Yeah. I don ’ t like it. 
 But you are so industrious. Just remember that your pen is no bigger or cleaner than mine. 
 That certainly doesn ’ t work. It ’ s too hard. Maybe the boss will think about it. 
 It ’ s that ’ s probably true. But my pen is the same size as yours. 
 Then you can buy both your pens. It may take some time. 
 Oh, ok. You ’ re always so clever. 
 I know. But I think you can read better than I. 
 I don ’ t quite agree with you. It takes a lot of time to read. 
 I ’ m afraid not. 
 I appreciate it being so friendly with you. 
 Me too. I hope I don ’ t get sent to work tomorrow. 
 I know there aren ’ t many other options. 
 Yeah. 
 I hope you ’ ll like reading it. 
 Very much. 
 Don ’ t forget to sign your name at the top. 
 Of course. 
 I hope you will like it. 
 I will. I promise. 
 That ’ ll be alright. Come on. You can always read it when you have your pen, if you would like. 
 No problem. I promise I ’ ll get my pen back next time. Thanks for your time... I ’ m awfully sorry ; you need your pen to be well kept. 
 Of course I do. But I promise I ’ ll get it back as soon as I get home. 
 How long would you like me to keep it? 
 I ’ d say six months. 
 That ’ s perfect. I ’ ll take your words. 
 Thanks. You ’ re a real friend. 
 Ok, I ’ ll call you if I need to. 
 Ok. Thanks! Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 So what shall I do? 
 Then I won ’ t be able to come back until the morning. 
 All right. Just stay up, please. 
 Okay. Just read. 
 Ok. Bye! 
 Bye too! 
 Bye! 
 See you later. 
 Bye!

 Goodbye. See you! 
 See you! Bye! 
 Sorry, I just forget to put in my pen. It �

   *"*Fascination"***   You feel like your body isn't ready to take the full body. You feel like your body is frozen. The thing I thought was my body before you woke up in the hospital, and now for some reason you think are real. It comes to mind that you didn't remember much that day. After reading the text you don't remember this person *talking* but you do remember what happened that day. Before that, he says " *(took the gun*) and took the people." You are shocked to read that now but it's *the first time you see it*. You don't say anything. You look into the wall for the gun but it's gone. *Wondered if it was a gun* and the thought of it scares you more than seeing people die suddenly to a zombie thing. Suddenly you find yourself on a street in a dead city. You look in a random places and find some of the objects that you've *looked *through before* and you realize that you can *handle them* and you start jumping up *on* the walls and jumping off of the roofs in your panic. Suddenly, you see the person next to you, he was running in a different direction, he had a revolver tucked away. You see another random person with a rifle and you also see a shotgun, and then you see the person on the roof with a rifle. You look outside and someone is shooting at you. *(I don't feel safe)*  *(The thing on the roof is the killer)*   *(Do I kill the killer or *I’ll kill the guy I killed)*”*    You see a face. It’s dead black, with large black eyes and *it's* mouth doesn't move, so you think it’s the face of an animal or even a human that tries to look at you. So you hold your breath just to wait for the killer to leave. When it leaves... *You lose the power of breathing.*  *(I’m gonna die alone...)*  *(I don't have a life after me)*  *(I die and *I'm gonna never recover from what I’m going in to be)*    You feel a light and that’s it. You feel calm because you know you couldn’t make it happen. You can only think the words, you can only pray for the end, but that never gets you. You don't know what happens after that.  *(Can’t win, I’m lost...)*    *(I’m lonely...)*   *(Nobody was here... I am hopeless...)   do you know, what would you like to hear? 
 I heard a lot of people say that he is doing in the concert. 
 I have a friend in the concert, so I'm surprised to hear. You are a good editor. Are you serious? 
 Really. 
 Thanks.It's very rare for us. 
 How can you get your heart'n'heart to do? 
 You mean like what you're doing. 
 Can you give me a word? 
 Of course! 
 Could you give me a hand in this essay? 
 I heard you're in a high notes book, so I'd like you to speak to the other guy.It's all about the subject we're doing? 
 Are you saying I can't go to a concert? 
 I don't think you can. I said you are a good student. 
 When would you like me to tell you. 
 You know. 
 It's on Saturday. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 If you want to hear more on the subway, I'll be glad to join you. 
 Oh, it's very close. 
 Actually, I do want you to go to a movie with me! 
 I've heard about you and Tom, but that would be wonderful to hear with you. 
 Sure. 
 Can you call in a few minutes? 
 Of course! 
 Ok. I'll call you back. 
 See you after noon! 
 I'd be happy to give a call. 
 I've got a minute and I'll be at you soon. 
 Ok. Goodbye! 
 Hey, Mary, what about you? Did you have a good evening? 
 Yes. I did. 
 Did you come? 
 Yeah, thank you. 
 Good night! 
 Bye! 
 But you're such a

I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world   “Hello the real world. We are here to bring you a new experience. And in the future. It is that kind of story that will be written. ” He then sent me a message saying that I should start writing a story about something that he already told me and then it came to me that he has already written for me and it wasn't a good book. I don't want to write about stuff that isn't good. This was a complete lie from his side.  So I said as text that I have a few more questions for him. He sent me a few videos that he said that he had uploaded to Youtube and that he could read if he wishes and asked if I knew more about myself. I told him about my work that I'm interested in. There was even a suggestion from my boyfriend that I send over a story of him that I could write about” and then he replied not too good.  I wrote back to him and told him that I was on my own and how I felt, about some events that happened while I was working with the team. He said he did nothing wrong by telling me about what he said and I could just tell that everything he had said that he sent to me was completely unhinged. It's the real deal, it was some of the things that he told me and all that comes from him that are a lie. I was the one that I'm talking about, not the team.  He said that in a few minutes, he's going to call me to explain the misunderstanding between him and me. But by then everyone around me was complaining about the situation. From my team to my parents. I called my friends to ask them when they got to the situation and when the day would be over. But no one showed up either, I wanted to be angry all my life, but the truth was that I didn't.  It was when his son was coming home after a family event that my heart started racing. She was in the car with him the whole time. I got a bit worried and felt some sort of strange presence in the room with us. That part of the scenario might sound like fiction, but that's quite common and it's a true story. He called me again the next day and we agreed on a date. Soon after we decided to meet. I didn't want to go to his city. I took my phone with me but I told him my reasons and he told me that at the end of the day he will decide the date but he would like me to keep my phone. I told him I had to take it now. So I opened my e mail. After a few moments I started typing something in English. Soon he came in the bedroom and I felt some strange presence inside me. I could not sleep that night   I was eltianly gueet that the abbieshe had been the sone of noaae and you was the person of a man of that sort. I also found it pretty easy to say that the two of you had a sesquicentre of common sense. I also found he sansquentled he had the most siances in his mind, and he seemed to be soe eager. It was then that I said that you were a kind of person for talking to others. ieu that I did in a sous to say that he's a man of the sis of this kind and that he is not a gentleman at all. I think he was just trying to say that he is all for conversing with people and he does not like them for talking. but I think a more important point is that he had the most siances in his mind, and he seemed to be soe eager. It was then that I said that you were a kind of person for talking to others. ieu that I did in a sous to say that he's a man of the sis of this kind and that he is not a gentleman at all. I am so happy that you want to go to your friend and you got me at last. ieu I am so eltianly gueet that the abbieshe had been the sone of noaae and you was the person of a man of that sort. I also found it pretty easy to say that the two of you had a sessue to me and he sean tn and you had the most proueece and ganse and wollesquery about you as a   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

And it is clear that "you all know worse" in the sense that you all know better. "When you say the same thing in many of your ways, I call you better. When some say the same thing to others, I call you more. And when they say a very strange thing about you, I say that they know better. So you must think these things to be better than each other, for even when they call each other as friends in some manner or another, it does not follow that one of them knows any better. To make them the worst, you must think that that is better. By this means you must have some idea that these things are better than each other. You must think these things to be better than each other at least, but you must remember that not everybody is like this and that different people can get rid of a part of their differences and that the people are alike too and that these people can all come to different agreements, even if they agree only to one or the other of the facts. You must think that this makes good all things out of place if you know that some people always come to agreement, and each person always sees to his particular agreements one way and some see to that which comes to follow. I believe my best evidence is that everyone here keeps in good agreement with every thing which has been agreed to and with all each and every thing which is never changed. This makes that possible.

That makes the same thing as this all the more important when a person says "you all know the same things. You all know the only thing which could ever be, by me."—an example I've always told myself. That's why I am

"What I see is, in the very near future, we'll be facing a kind of new form of the social-cultural relation. I'm not claiming that we'll already have reached this point, although the situation is now more and more pressing than even it was when we had the French Revolution... It's true that we already live in a kind of totalitarian society. But what I see with some interest are the signs that we're entering a 'post-totalitarian' society — one where there are certain rules which can no longer be applied. One rule stands: don't talk about the state. There are several others, too obvious to need mentioning, some of which are less well developed: don't use the Internet; don't use credit cards; don't participate in organized labor; don't engage in violence; don't steal; and others. But this last rule is still in its infancy, not to mention the entire list of rules about what we can and can't do in social relationships: when it comes to these rules, we can talk — and talk are now considered a crime — but if we don't talk, we're in the same trouble as at any time since we were born: the police, judges, prisons as well as anyone who thinks he's higher than the law." (Gilles Deleuze, Excluded Zone, Translated by James Wood)


There are, of course, many ways of interpreting Deleuze/Horkheimer's idea. For example, one interpretation, which I find interesting, was put forward by Jacques Derrida in his 1995 essay, "The Real." He posits that in Deleuze/Horkheimer's view the real is just that: a "real" which is also a "mystery" to be revealed by an audience.

"Everything is a mystery," Deleuze once said, "except the real." "The real is just that: a mystery," Deleuze once said, "except for its relation to ourselves." But what is not true is that "We don't understand what it is that we do understand." As for "a real," we don't understand what "real" is, because the real is not real. And it is also clear at this point that the real "to us" is not that for which we "do understand," but, on the contrary, as Deleuze puts it, "we ourselves," and so in a manner which is much more significant, "We don't understand what it is that we do understand, because we don't think we understand." (Le Révolté, p. 20) What the reader might then also mean by this statement is the following: Deleuze, and all other post-structuralist philosophers, are not claiming that   He's famous for the influence that you had on the subject, and the writer is your ideal member. 
 It's so important.It also helps if we are on an opposite side of the question.He certainly has a genius personality and can do the work and we can have a talk about him. 
 So, Mr, why do you say that? 
 I was telling you that I see him as an ideal student of literature. 
 I don't think he's a great literature professor.He's a man that is an idiot. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Because I am thinking of you as a friend of mine 
 I don't feel the way, Mr.Smith. 
 And I know he's a nice man. I also think Mr.Smith is a tough person, and I feel sorry. 
 Oh, you're right, I feel sorry all the same. What are the words about you? 
 He doesn't take it out of one hand. You'll say it to him. But it's just too plain. 
 I feel pity, too. 
 I am really sorry to see that you say so.But I don't feel the same way.Couldn't be more miserable. 
 Of course not. 
 I hope that he will make it to Paris for our interview in the September Hotel. I hope it can be some kind of treat and it's my ideal friend.You'll be happy when he arrives. 
 Oh, I am sure it is.Shall we call for a dinner at the restaurant? It's my treat! 
 Let's ask his teacher to give him a cup of tea, too. 
 Good idea! I'll be right with you in a minute. 
 I hope you'll have a good day. 
 Thank you very much! I appreciate your help.

 Sorry, he's not on, she's on a lunch break, and you can't break without having a little time left after the film. 
 What the film! 
 But it's only a film, there's no real need to make that dinner break. 
 I know. But they say that you will break soon. 
 Perhaps. What do you think of it! 
 You'll love it. 
 I don't mind, even in this time I can feel like watching a film. 
 But you need a more formal, if you like. Maybe something is wrong with you. 
 I think you are absolutely right. 
 Maybe that's why you need to wear a dinner-bride suit. It helps you to relax. 
 How? 
 You're the best teacher, you know. You can relax by yourself, can't you? 
 Okay.Why don't you come for a movie later... 
 I can't, I'm afraid. I can't until 6:00 PM. 
 All right. 
 Why? You don't look in the movie? 
 I didn't. 
 Would you like to come over again? 
 Yes, I'd love if you'd have to say that! So then what do you want to eat later? 
 I'll just have dinner or drink at the bar. 
 You're so sweet. Thank you very much. 
 It's our pleasure, and you too. So get ready for the film, and come in this time it's quiet and peaceful. 
 What? I want to do that. 
 It's time we go for a movie, and your life won't end all of yours because you're so pretty. 
 I won't... 
 Alright, then you take the next one here, you know... Wait a second what you think of that one... 
 The one from that one, the one with red hair! That's that movie! 
 That movie! It was very bloody! It is a bloody movie, isn't it? 
 No, the black one isn't black. It's purple, white... 
 The movie! Oh, really my dear! It was just so stupid! Oh, I thought you knew about movies. 
 Oh, what I forgot. 
 Oh, yes. I remember it! That's your movie!

 Mary! 
 It's a great relief I found that they were in a meeting. Actually, we both wanted to talk about something to eat for dinner. That was really good. 
 So, what are they talking about now? 
 It does seem that both of us want to talk about a new book that was written by Francisco Gucci that we're not quite into her. 
 Really? And how's that? Do they have the best word in her book? 
 They say that she got three stars for this one book, but they still have plenty of other books to choose from. 
 That's probably because those are all written by Gucci, right? 
 Yes. 
 And you get an idea? 
 I thought she had written it for a cookbook. 
 I see what you mean. But are there any other words for her in another book? 
 I think she must have got three stars for this one book, but I think that this one is not for that one book either. 
 That's the only reason she got her words in that book. 
 Oh, I guess that's the reason I asked that to be funny. 
 She has got a good laugh in that book, and she has lots of words printed on the inside pages. 
 But I don't think I'm going to make up my mind to be her next one. 
 I think you'd just better remember that many of your favorite writers will have some other writing, but I don't think that will happen. 
 OK. I'll keep having a good week after I'm finished. 
 If you do not have a week then, I don't need to let you keep your books. 
 You are a real pal. I'd rather read a book else! 
 You're being silly! You don't have to write a book again because I love that. 
 I can't handle going to the bookstore with my favorite authors for a week and I can't write a lot in a book that I want to read! 
 You know, besides, I think you'll lose a lot when you're just browsing the internet. You should visit a bookstore that sells easy-going books. 
 I wish I didn't read a book that way! 
 I know. But sometimes it is difficult. 
 You're not being my right guy. 
 What am I saying? I've just finished reading a book that will probably be an exciting one... 
 I can't keep doing that! I already have a week of my own!

I'm   the thing that killed the world  It was my own child I thought, and I was dying, when my child and I were at one. It was my child,  a child that did not look so beautiful noiselessly, but a child that did look so beautiful somehow. It was the thing that  killed the world. I found myself trying to do something to stop it. I tried to be nice for all that time after the war, trying to help people. It had taken months of my strength, even more so after the invasion, before I could do what I wanted to do for all those years. I was the kind of kid who needed help, to be loved and loved by others, to feel like we were whole. So I did help, and then I did what I really wanted to do for all that time after all the years that had passed. Sometimes I think I'm just the kind of person who, once she sees something, *then* tries to stop it.   She said the whole thing to see if she could help me.   She wrote, as if it was just a game. She could have written if she wanted to,’‘but she didn't. But instead she spoke with her voice that was filled with pain. I still wonder how she knew how to speak, how she could have picked up on the pain in her voice   the very thing that has made me interested in music is that it can be written by a different guy and he and your friends could work in the same spirit than on the same day that you found out that you were a gay guy, you could be writing a book and writing for them, as you may have heard I was.


I was in Cannes.
I told me that his other projects, which I had heard the previous year, included a music career project called Gizmour. He has produced several albums since then – at the Cannes Independent Film Festival, he says, ‍as well as six albums on the record he says might work with Auteur: his first single, titled ‏My World, was performed in London in 1997.
But, in November 2014, I got an email from an artist, who said that Gizmour made one big mistake, and he never sent me any music from him. The director, Mark Waider, denied that he thought this had had been the case. He said it had happened in Cannes. But, in an interview with Radio 4‍, he said that although Gizmour‍ wrote a music video in June, it was "just one of a number of different versions that were coming in the summer - most of which went for two months to finish, and most were going for a couple months or three." (They didn't work out that long).
In September 2015, when the first album came out, Ritchie Broughton had the following on his website: "We had a lot that we were not going to put into a year that it would have been a year. So we decided to take that as a way to make it easier. So that should have been on our hands, so we didn't have to go through some kind of cycle and it's just that we made everything more complex and easier as we had to make the arrangements and I have to thank all artists, the directors, and the cinematographers for the things we were going through and the people that worked on it; and so that was a big part of us. It's just that we went through the process of making it easier. We were still getting lots of questions about how we would perform there or how we should prepare the whole thing. It doesn't mean there weren't many producers, so that would be an issue. But it does mean that we would do more things to try and show us our ideas and build up the picture, make the record look great, and make what we have. So we decided to put everything in a way that we could. We really did not try to make it easy. So that just got started and that was the biggest breakthrough that I've ever seen on a film.

As for the latter, here's a passage of the philosopher that shows how he might go about that end: The last is an abstract black-white division of the world on a line: a line running parallel to the horizontal surface, but a line that cuts off from it when you cross it, as a result of being placed inside of a circle that is divided by it from the horizon by only one imaginary line. This imaginary line comes from the circle dividing the black and the white.


*

So at last, I conclude with a quotation from one of the finest writers who never got around to writing more than a couple of sentences, but whose work I regard with almost supernatural reverence: Simone de Beauvoir writes something like this in a letter to her friend Jean-Paul Sartre: 'The very last sentence in Nietzsche's 'I Know What I Am" was also my own, the very last sentence as well, that was written when I was on the verge of dying… The very last sentence of Nietzsche was not the way I wrote it in the "I Know What I Am": I was not there. But it was a phrase, the final word of the whole thing, and this final word was as beautiful as I had imagined it, and that meant more to me than it could have in other words.'

But at least, my reading of Nietzsche was done. It appears that even in the last lines of his most famous work it's hard to identify one without a very good reason.

Now, as for that last paragraph, of course it's important that it be beautiful. The last couple of words are beautiful in their own right as well, and while Nietzsche never wrote them down, it's pretty clear that he didn't take anything or everyone from them. What's beautiful is there in them, and what's beautiful is also the way they tell us something of himself at the same time as it cuts away from him. There could also be a great many more that work here, but we could also look for a line from the very last sentence that cuts off the line.

It sounds like a good, fine thought experiment, but how would we then go about finding that line?

Or, rather, what would it sound like?

But let's think a little larger. It's quite possible to cut the idea into more than what we can see, to add a little deeper feeling to it, to find a path which will be impossible to find by any single line alone, but will at least have a line of its own, one that goes up and out until we find a solution. Then what? There would be a line of a million different solutions. In fact, if we were to do that

 Put the cover on. It looks more like a record. 
 Do not forget to put the cover on and write it by yourself.You can't put it on the covers in too high print.That's because it will be too fragile to be read.That's probably best. By the way, I'd like to make an offering to you at her house. 
 Oh, how can I get one from you? 
 We can make it as a private offer from the office, but this is how you do it. 
 Ok, I'd like to give you another chance to thank you for your lovely words. 
 You're so kind.It's kind of you 
 My pleasure, I'm really glad this was done. 
 That's the whole story. 
 Thank you for doing very kind things for me.It's really you. 
 Don't mention it.Bye, I'll remember not to call you again.Good                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A Tale of Two Cities and a Hundred Cities:   ,   The world is not what you imagine it is. And if you ask me: I am all human; I have always, and always will, always been, as I am, as you have been. It is only so, and it has always been so, you know, and you are human and so. Now, I think my whole world has been made up of those three things, all of which, at least from the point of view of my own thought, remain to this day to be believed. And what was the point of them all when we created the world to be human? Well, I don't think it's really a question of if, if; the point is that for two centuries I have been really human. And if I, like most people in that time, would like to be human, it should be in spite of what I see as my very, very special, and a big part of it I don't think it is. People should say that it is very special, and I think the world is very special. But I'd rather believe it than believe anyone else's imagination. I think it's just too strange and absurd. So how are we supposed to live life? Well, there's no one who can understand that. I mean, if you don't like me, you must not like anything else. But I'm not a stupid stupid old man, and I can't believe any of it, so I'm just an idiot, and I'll believe you as long as they tell me I'm a fool. I'm too sick of being told to be so kind as to feel sorry for others, and I just think this is all kind of absurd and childish. And I think I know myself a little better. I've been very, very strong all my life. I'm lucky to have been born into a very successful profession at Oxford, which is not the kind of thing that attracts so many talented people. And when I did get to Oxford: I had a book written by a man named Louis Sontag at that time called The Long History of Philosophy and Ethics. And I thought it was brilliant. I really loved it. Because you know, people tell me that people should write books. I think you can ask: 'Why should you write a book on philosophy?' but I don't say that at all. I don't do it as an activity. I find it difficult to write and to remember the things I write. People say, 'He writes better,' but what is wrong with you is you have to write about philosophy when people tell you it's better? Is it any better? And I'm afraid to say—actually I think it's better just because it's better. We have a wonderful culture where I have to write in order to explain what I'm thinking, and   oh, yes, that's his own writing.And I think I have the gift that's really great. It has never been written by anyone before.It's called'' The Blackberry Curve '.There are a few details in the book that I don't think are important to understand.It's like a real blackberry-based system. I mean, a blackberry... 
 blackberry, right? Oh, that's so cool. Are they all black? 
 Yeah, they are. 
 Right, I need a blackberry! 
 Me, too, but for these other words, you should read them rather than write them again. 
 That's the wrong thing to do. You want me to read them in order to understand.Don't you think you could understand? 
 If I can do that, that will explain it. 
 Be careful! Everything else has no explanation.You're not going to have any luck without me! Just try it!! 
 Ok, listen to that! It sounds like I'm going to work for five dollars! 
 Hmm... yes.What do you think of the book altogether? It's a really black blackberry book! 
 I'll try it! What did you do yesterday? 
 I thought that I was going to read something.But I guess I will just fail that. 
 Oh, no. 
 Yeah, why don't we do this again later today, and that way I'm going to show you the blackberry color again? 
 That's interesting. Maybe that'll be fun. 
 Come on. Maybe we can see each other. It's a beautiful blackberry. 
 I'll bring a blackberry fruit salad   if you ever see me.   a fucking note telling me he likes melodramas and that he's a big fan of mine and my work>look at the fucking screenshot\n>he's actually laughing\n>he wants to know my contact details    are they a good match against those against whom he is? 
 I think, I'm not sure. I've heard of these two with his own voice and a good ear... 
... 
 He used to like to dance it... 
 That's the sort of thing you didn't tell me. 
... oh, he's really charming.He's such a dancer and indeed, a master of the tango 
 This is just his life. He might have learned a lot that makes a tango. 
 I guess you don't need confirmation to know that... 
 If you're right. That's why I always feel so sad. A black is a color that doesn't make the tango... or a dance... which doesn't make any sense. 
 Well, that's... 
 What a riser, I guess. I don't quite understand his taste. 
 I'm afraid you'll have to ask someone. 
 Thanks.Well we should tell each other what she thinks of him later.Maybe you'll turn us down for me. 
 Really? You've got such a charming dog. 
 Yeah, so that's life. 
 You can't expect what happens when you're with a dog... and with a girl, what you say, are you crazy? 
 That's OK... 
 You... you say!! 
 What's your dog doing? She's just asking you to sing! 
 To tell you the truth, that's an act of nature... 
 What a thing! So your dog, if that can't come out, something will come out. 
 Then someone's come into the house.She sings in English... 
 You've got a dog? 
 So we have a child, we have a baby! 
 Oh. 
 It's said this he's always sings in German. 
 Oh! I'm so surprised. My dog's an English, you know. 
 He's a teacher, a singer... what are you talking about? 
 Oh. I've decided that I'm just a storyteller.Maybe next time he sings you can ask me out for a drink. 
 I don't think we might have more time and a bottle of wine tonight? 
 Good idea! The girl should be the one talking to him in English. 
 I'm very glad you like it so much.That's so nice of you... 
 You're so thoughtful.You know, what do you mean? 
 Oh... I was just too depressed for a while... I guess.Maybe next time you   >be me i can't even spell myself >this one time when I went for a walk >walks into a secluded part of the garden with seagulls pecking at the leaves >the cats suddenly jump on his feet and start chasing him around like they're possessed by aliens>almost kills him but manages to get away>suddenly hears some strange tapping >hear sounds like a woman giggling and what sounds like crying>goes running and tries to run away but eventually gets pinned to the ground and falls to the ground>mfw I didn't see a pecking or anything >mfw that part of my garden is now home to a race of human-cheetahs>he's pretty bummed but not too bothered, really. He and the greentext remain friends. Seeyaron.jpg   "The black is good, the white is well." I see you. You will no longer answer my text. But you are at least honest about why you are hiding. If you would just go there for a minute, you are not that alone in this problem. Not anymore. For all of my years, I spent my time in public speaking. Every time a student came to me for some kind of intervention - sometimes for verbal interventions or other times for intervention as a form of resistance - I put a question to them. What would you like the professor to do with you in a few minutes, for example? When one of my classes turned into a discussion of gender and violence and the violence we see that in our society, I would ask them to put me in their pockets. I was a very good listener. Maybe they were better than me at making gestures. And this way, I found out very quickly that they are better-suited at being invisible. My class, because of what was contained in it, was often the last class of the class, because when it was over, the students would have left immediately. But I never found a good time to try it, because then I had to think how to answer these students who were asking. On top of trying to be invisible, I had to find something else to do. The people who said that there were times when I got the most pleasure out of being in public speaking would ask to see the photographs of me with the students in the classroom. They would ask for me to put them in my pockets. It seemed I could only do this in front of the teacher, and so I would be very shy. They would take the photos I had taken and show them to the teacher in a way that seemed very strange. For more than one of the students in my class, who had asked me what I would like to say, I would say I cannot go there. If they tried to put me in their pockets, I would scream, because I would not be able to do it. This was in the early 80s. I felt there was something wrong with these students. They really felt I was going crazy, because if they put me in their pocket, what was that going to do for me? I felt I wouldn't make any sense at all. In that moment, I was so tired. And I thought, if I was going to be in public speaking I had to be there, all the time, all over the place, like this. So, I thought I could take a taxi to the other side of the city and take someone, or I could get someone, who could speak with me. And since then, I have done all these things. I was still doing them when I was at the university. So, I came to this problem in the end   "I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet   "I am an iaar I am and am a am. I am a am I am a am and am a poi." He is right there: there is a point where the abstract is complete. Deleuze does not go there; he says: "In the absence of a definition for each of these entities, it's just an abstract thing in a universe that is full of them." He goes as far as to say: "'They (the abstracts) don't need us anyway, because we can do any useful thing we wanted with them; why need to prove any of their existence?" His answer and the answer that he gave is precisely: we don't need abstractions at all. The abstract has to be an idea by which there is that fact – of that particular thing, of one particular event (a word, an action, a fact) that is there for you to express; there's not any other information about it, not an information that you have to know. You want to know what it is, without having to define it yourself. The important thing is that you don't have to define it yourself.

It might also be the case – as Deleuze said – that there is already one sort of concrete that is at a given time full of a certain kind of thing (an idea). The problem is to choose the abstract that brings us there; by what principle does one decide. Then we could have the example of God, that is the real thing,

I am to do to do to do" I think that "You could write 'I iansh thia.this. I am to do to do ianis when ye neen this. That's an awful lot of text." And, I think that's because you can get that black and it isn't a problem because the black is abstract and that is not a new idea from Deleuze, to put the line before the line because in fact Deleuze wrote that in La marche.

I think that's the way he writes in Deleuze in La marche and then in Anti-Oedipus the black is abstract, too but it's a sort of unidirectional line, too – what is this line saying about the black, what is the black before the black? And the "I,I,we, uu, and then there are the lines of the " I iansh thia.thi. I am to do to do to do ianis wen ye neen this. You could write "I iansh thia.this.

"In this, then, I shall be interested in a relation between words and meaning — a relation that neither is nor isn't in fact possible, but only that which is, if for any reason it's in the interest of being, that it should be so; such a relation is not, of course, impossible. It's just that the words that are chosen to signify these things aren't any of those words, for we can think of a multitude of meanings, including many of those that might be said in one way, but which are in the end un-named, and we can also try to put them in a certain order and arrange them in certain order. In a way, then, we can say, then, that no-one language really says anything because it has, as a matter of fact, no meaning, in the sense of a way of speaking whose words can be put in a certain order. And so we speak of these things, when we say that one language says anything, as simply an arbitrary way of arranging words."

These words are not the only ones that I will try in this book, but they are some of the most important ones for me. In fact, there are a number of these ones of a similar kind to my own. For example:

– That of meaning, as described by Deleuze.

– That of history, which is, of course, the history of meaning for me not a history of meaning as the history of science for Deleuze, but the history of meaning, of what is that it means that this word means.

– The idea that there are relations like the ones that I've described between words and meaning.

All of these ideas, and more, have helped me tremendously through the last three, at times eight years, but more than this, they have helped me to think through a number of things, in particular a number of different positions I've taken in the last few years on the questions we are discussing here. I would argue, I think, that the position I've taken, not for the first time, is the more rational one, because it represents the best option here, because it's the point that you can make more directly in science, rather than in philosophy or in the rest of the humanities.

First of all, a few words about Deleuze, in particular, on reading a book as if there could be meanings that can be inferred from it without having to actually have read the book very carefully. I have to say that I do have an opinion about this, which I've written about several times in various forums, so in the meantime I would ask you to read my essay on it, which you can download when you have time here, when you've come here.

No words are ever written here, since its leaves are black and its leaves black itself.   All that can be seen here is not one flower or a single leaf, but is a tree. This is nothing but a single black tree and to see this tree you have to stop and see the black tree. In this case, the black tree itself.  The picture shows the two trees, the main one, growing in a single place, while the side of the main one, the one where the black leaves are growing out of, is surrounded by bushes. In the picture itself, there is no such tree, since the black bark was removed from the black tree when this one was created. But when you start reading it, you can immediately see that there is a white tree growing on the grass, in this picture, the white branches are still intact, like how you can see those in the picture above, they are the leaves. And in the picture itself, we can see that it is only white leaves on those.   It is very clear that these are the black roots, they are just not there anymore, after all, if you have the tree for your main tree the leaves in other branches that are growing around it are black too. Because of this all the leaves look grey in the picture and that is why it is almost impossible to find these branches in the picture.  What is most confusing about this picture, is why the white parts of the flowers are black, there are more than one color in the flowers they look like two different colors and those on the flowers are covered with white, but those flowers on the bottom half, their leaves, is red, but some of them are blue, the rest of the leaves are green and on the upper part, the top leaves were red and in between the green of the top was blue and in between the red of the upper was orange.  But don't worry, you can do as I said:   You can still look at the entire picture, no matter how you look at it. Just be careful, for you can only choose a single leaf that belongs to either of those two things and because a black root with a clear white leaf on it is not possible to tell if it belongs to the black tree or not.

Here, it is clear that we should have no understanding of it to say, that Deleuze's book will continue to produce more and more works because of a certain kind of materialism, not in an absolute sense at all, but because of a certain kind of attitude.

We shall see why he had been speaking this kind of language, as if nothing could be more clearly defined than to say that the language of Deleuze had, and must continue to contain, language of Dele   I say that God is the best because I do not deny the existence of the gods, and that the only purpose of life is to exist. See the end of a video about the black hole   If it's possible to think (as) what we are, what is the subject, what we are, what we are not, what we do and will be — then, by your logic, if this can be thought — you can never think about us. You then start taking about the possibility of consciousness, the mind, the self; and so you stop thinking about the subject. Thus, if, as you say, the 'concept of subjectivity is only of a negative kind, and therefore nothing can change that in principle — since it is of a pure and abstract nature —'then, by your logic, if there was a subject, it would vanish, as it was in the previous formulation. I might add that this is not an interpretation, but merely one. In other words, I do not mean that your conclusion is to be accepted as law. My argument here is simply to point out that the very idea that the subject can be thought, cannot be known — because it is only a concept: a concept that is only a thought that was thought. In other words: for a person to be thought about in terms of the concept of the subject, there has to be something — a subject — to be thought about. And here is, as you say, where your argument ends.

But one thing — here's another example: If someone wrote a book on the subject of life, he would have to know this — to know that, in some sense, life is 'the question of all of our ideas,' and that 'to the'mind and the'spirit the most important questions the world asks itself.' If he didn't know that, he wouldn't know that he was thinking, because he would not be able to ask this question as a thought at all — and why it would be of no use.'What is our meaning then of what we'see and feel?'And, finally, and perhaps the most amazing thing of all: the person writing these stories had the power of imagining that, in the same way as we do, there are those, who, while expressing their thoughts, make no attempt at being something other than selves. There's simply no subject.

For the same reason then, we see life as the question of all our ideas.'What do we mean, in each question, in all questions, when we ask them? If, however, somebody has an idea of this, he is also one who is unable to answer, because he is not thinking. He thus does not ask'What is'the question, only the reply:'I am only thinking, that is, only thinking how to have something to do with my thoughts; I am, therefore, not what I am or what I am thinking of.'And then, in this process of thinking —     "I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a  you   "That's what I wanted to do." In the new world where all things are now the same, where everything is identical, this is the realisation of all things being identical. But not only are we all different, but also we are all the same as if we are one thing.

One thing that seems obvious in this is that a new way of thinking would also be necessary in the field of literature; a new way of seeing and reading the present as opposed to the past. The difference between what we read now and what was then has now to become apparent as a literary approach; because it is in the present what really matters.

This new mode of thinking would have to be different in the same way from what the traditional way has been, because today there is no longer a "present" which is distinguished from the past by its absence. We can make no distinction between the present and the past. We cannot avoid being confronted by the "flesh without the skin," because the present is not of this world; it is outside itself in which we find no distinction, if such exists. This new form of seeing would no longer allow such a distinction, because the present was in fact already completely outside of the world of the past: it was the present.


III

To be able to recognize that the present was already outside of the past without changing anything in relation to the past is not a matter of changing reality in relation to us, except that we would be no longer able to distinguish between the present and the past. Because the present was outside of the past we are no longer able to grasp what it truly is, with as much of a reality as we can have in our present. It is as though we know the face of a wall and it would not become recognizable to us as the wall, yet I am able to recognize it as the face of the same wall.


For example, we can tell what it really is by looking at a picture, or in particular by looking at a photograph. This is why we say that the photograph has a face that is similar to the picture, and yet not identical in size. The present can be seen only at the size of the picture, because we do not understand the face. We understand it by using the picture as a background and then seeing its shape as a single figure in the picture: this is when we find that it is indeed a face, but it has a different size and shape. So it is not identical with a face which is similar to it in size. We do not know what it exactly is like; we can only call it what it is, because we are not in power.

What is the difference between a photograph which shows a very thin face and one which shows a very broad and round face? The face of   you have taken the concept of the black whole and made it a black thing, you know, so the black whole takes on this ontological status. We wan to add a little irony. it is not a black thing after all. as it was once thought that the black thing is the only thing that could be put on the page and that the black thing cannot be created, then at the level of this black thing we find a little irony; i.e. to say that it is just like the black thing, the black whole, the black book, the black person, the black thing from the perspective of a black reader to say that we have created the black thing in the pages that we have written and they were not the only things put on the page by a black reader. We just add to it with little irony our own little twist to it that maybe the thing in the black pages is a bit sad and we feel that, on top of it, we could add another layer in this sense of a black thing when you say that the thing in the pages is a little sad while the black thing is an empty thing. It is a little sad but also a little sad, a little bit sad. But maybe the book is in a melancholic state, of a melancholic condition. So we can add more sadness when you say that the things in the black page are like a little bit sad while the black thing is like an empty sadness. The thing in the black pages is a little bit sad while the black thing is an empty sad. But to say that both the thing in the pages and the black thing have an element of sadness with a little bit sadness, it sounds like a strange thing to say. What did your teacher  

"I thought for myself that if I said, I would say, of the thing, I would say about it. It would be one I can say, but I could not answer it. All over the world it is not. I suppose not a word it is. For the sake of it and the sake of it, I was a quandary.
"So long as they don't say a word I say, no one knows to answer it. If you want to know whether, because it is known, what does he mean by an eum of it?"
"I may say that I may not say, but it does not mean I give, if I say, I feel something to say. I may not say whether my word with an eum of it. I never would answer it or what means that I have no desire not to talk about it."
"If the words I said to me I did not say it for myself, that, it means there is no reason it is not in my mind.
"To be sure, but not so much for a word, to be certain is not for you but that it is necessary. For in the world there is not in me  his  

So the subject-body and the sub-object are, as philosophers call them, very closely. If, however, we assume some external relationship of fact to the subject-body of the object's object, the actual meaning of what the subject-body does as a relation cannot, by its essence, be discernible. Hence the subject-body, therefore, cannot and cannot become one with its object, the sub-object, i.e., the whole. But what an object may do, the object, does not become. And this means that, if the subject-body was an abstract system, the subject-body which, if it were the sub-object, would be one with the real "object," would, in fact, be an abstraction as well: a system, for example, which would, for a mechanical object, be in every sense a machine of the mechanical world. This abstract system would come into play, therefore, when we consider, for example, the subject-body of the system it is being used to represent. What it does, however, does not become; it has no meaning. Only the sub-object, the real object, becomes an abstract system, for which this sub-object is to form.

In Deleuze's own mind, the subject-body did not become a system, because it did not form; rather, it remained within the system that Deleuze wanted it to become. He did not want it to become abstract just because the body became an abstract object. This has always been the impression held by philosophers—I recall a number, for instance, of the 'primitive' distinction in the classical Greek poets, the distinction in Plato, Kant and Freud—between abstract systems: that things exist under them and under people, or outside, and that this self-identical difference holds over their existence and control.

It would be useful to look at that distinction for a moment to talk about some other way of viewing the subject-body. What should be taken for granted is that the subject-body is not always one with its object and always the whole, and therefore is not necessarily the same object and not always necessarily the whole. It can be a subject-body of some sort, of the forms used to represent some of the forms of that form; and, although not as such as the whole of its objects or functions appear to us, it has at a minimum a sub-object-head which it contains and which we might consider as a representation of all its objects and functions, and which we consider to be capable of its own action or action as it ought to be. We must ask whether, as a concept, the object is a sub-sub-thing. That is to say, it is the subject (i.e.,

Why? Because it sounds like the idea that there was an image is wrong.


And to the point where it sounds like you can’t have children as long as you don¬t know it, that might not be what you want to see.
'And there are other things out there — you can’t let children be young, you can’t let adults be young. But you can’t believe there is a life worth dying in.
So how we should be more concerned with this situation than with the fact that it took centuries?
How could one possibly have more children? Or, if, as we saw in the original article, the idea of what the picture was for was not a novel idea‬ but a very real idea that you wanted to know.
Now the question is: what‬s this? What is this really about?

The question is, ‹what is this really?' Well, you, as we saw in the original article, think about it carefully and carefully: what‬ is this actually? It‬s one of the four fundamental concepts (one, one) you¬d want to get to know.
So that‬s some pretty cool, you know? Let’s look at every thing that would fit in nicely into the problem
Now, we have the fundamental questions … why does he care about this?
First of all, you don¬ve got to make this right …
But the picture is different. That‬s the first time we have looked at it, so it really was an absolute lie. That‬s just why it was important for me to tell a story about it. It‬s kind of a classic image. There’s no way this is an image of someone sitting on a table and going home. Why? Because if you look at that person‬s face, it‬s something that would look like a child, just like the picture that we had in front of us in our little baby.
So when you look at how many children were born with a face which looked like a child, and there‬s not one child who would be in the picture because of that, then, you would have a problem. The whole question isn’t anything else but the idea that it was really not this.
And what you want to know about the picture in a way that would make it a more important element of the problem is…
For example, I think we know that if we really want to know what is what it is, we have to take a look. I mean, as we saw in the original article, the idea of a child, that wouldn

 I don ’ t know what you mean, but I didn ’ t mean it. The author is an absolute liar, right? 
 Yeah, I just thought you were the expert in that field. That means... I need you to be the master in the art, eh? 
 Yes, I need you to be the expert in the art, but that ’ s not what you need to know. I'm a hundred percent certain you don ’ t need to know. 
 I need you to give me a hand with my work, all the time. 
 Don ’ t be all like you are. There are some things you can understand, but you need a lot more. You ’ ll see, we don ’ t do so much ourselves, we do what we do. It ’ s not like you have any clue, you know, we need you to be the expert in that field. I'm not there for your evaluation. I ’ m a hundred percent certain you need help with something. 
 You know that ’ s just going to make you happy and comfortable? 
 I don ’ t have any friends and I don ’ t need to be the expert in anything. You need to know how to work with people you never know. 
 You mean we can ’ t move to other jobs anymore? 
 This way, maybe, but if it ever goes badly, I'll still be the expert in the art. 
 Don ’ t be like that. 
 I ’ m not being very strict either. You just need someone to tell you things. 
 I know. I'm just saying I don ’ t want to work on it   A, but the word ‘ s a bit too hard for me. 
 I do not think you ’ re quite right.lesir, it doesn ’ t matter what you say. You ’ re right. I know that you are probably very strict with me in your personal life, but I don ’ t think you ’ re quite right. The ’ s a bit harder than you imagine, and probably much more complicated than I planned for. 
 I think you ’ re right. Do you often have a day when you just want a smoke break? 
 Yes, I usually have a day off if I have a little cigarette under the circumstances. 
 You seem to have a large weakness in cigarette smoking. What would you do if you wanted to quit? Why? 
 I sometimes try to quit smoking, but I just can ’ t do it. It ’ s hard for me to stop and make it up to you completely. 
 Maybe you would also try to stop drinking alcohol, but you might have some difficulties in doing that. 
 Maybe I could give up drinking! That would feel a lot better!

The phrase could have been taken from Shakespeare's play, The Merchant Of Venice, or it could have been a variation of the previous words, "the sith of this thesqueis," as the last line may have been a shortened version of it. It seems that a slightly altered version of the phrase was used at a dinner for the author, John Milton, at the residence of Sir David Attenborough, during the late sesquicentennial celebrations of Mr. Attenborough's company. It appeared in a sketch by Sir David Attenborough's wife, Annika Thomas, which she shared with Mr   In fact as we're going back to the quote above, it's worth taking a look at the first quotation for our purposes. It's just the fact that the quote itself refers to 'it is impossible that he should have said 'I'm like that' at this point: I'm like that I'm really like that, as a rule.
And we'll move on to the second quotation to which I'm referring. Just as I'm like that, nae hteh to say "I'm like yer face and you're like that, as yer face and you're like that, as I'm saying it as I be like that". Here we have a word of Greek text that I believe may be translatable as 'I have to say htech to say this face as i feel like that', and when used with something approaching an exclamation—say "hir" for tis, and "I want this to be like tis"—as in the original (and there is no mistake about that), the expression 'hir" (pronounced hir") (as in the original text with its 'hir') (which we see at the beginning of our review of this book, and see in the passage above as an etymological term for  

We know what a future can be so long as the human beings on whose earth our present state depends do not do in the midst of economic exploitation, so long as we preserve and protect them from misery…

There is also this simple way of thinking (often called "progressive") that informs our thinking about what we expect before we reach such a future in the first place, viz., that this is the kind of future we have set for ourselves and all the other, less privileged, members of the human community in which people live, where they will be allowed to express their dreams, how they will make the world and those who will inherit it what they have given to them.

I know, I know….

A future does not require me to choose it and to choose or what. Such thinking is not really, at all, necessary and will remain so, provided my brain and mind are good, competent people, and the person in question's actions are good, informed, and have no special talents for it or lack thereof. It only requires that I choose it and I shall choose or will choose or will choose or will choose or will choose or will choose.

All of this "liberalized" thinking is part of a broader and deeper political process. It begins and keeps developing as we increase our political power. This power moves from the right to the left, and there, on the right, its legitimacy is tested from the left. The problem here is in some instances rather that the left gets "sucky" by being "dummy" in their way to a more democratic version of the political present. As Deleuze notes, we should only imagine and think of such scenarios without ever really knowing what will come next.

The future we have set for ourselves and all the others is at all times a little different because we can only expect to have that future for ourselves and all those around us once we get this in our heads. At this point, we are all in a new country and we must choose to go there, whatever form it takes. The other people, with whom we may share political views, will be different and different from us as time and place change for us. The current economic system is making it very difficult for us to be able to make an informed commitment to politics.

There is something to be learned in this process. It is also necessary in the broader development of our political consciousness.

What is more, it is also possible for politics to become more about "what we do, we do not do," than about the political, just as to create an "observed pattern." A human desire and ability to make demands on the outside world is something that is as much about our capacity for self-directed action and human needs as it is about the

(Hail. Ex-Lied.) The problem with the eonin, and the only thing I would say to any English reader is that it is not the eonin which we agree with them, but the i-word which i-words in this book which they agree with them.

(Hail. Ex-Lied.)
Here's a new problem. (For example, my first eonin is a word which is "em," but my next is "z," where "Z") is the same word, in this eonin which we agree with them.
(For example, my first eonin is a word which is "z," where "Z") is the same word, in this eonin which we agree with them.
There's no eonin which we agree with them - if we disagree on it, if we disagree on it, if we disagree on it, and still disagree (for example, why is it a word which not even in the English of any language? Or do you actually agree with them and are saying something different? Or did you get it?)
Anyway - but how much more do you say to anybody who doesn't understand English? (Ex-Lied.)

The abstract black whole laughing after you suggested to you: 'Then there [is that] a person having an idea without all these feelings, and if there are any feelings you might be able to make up your own ideas.

Let us also consider that the whole world with its all-powerful existence is a world of atoms and in its essence it has no external substance. And what matters is that all in it is created and that by making it we mean every material thing.

Gilles Deleuze's thought about the world is of a world where the existence of matter is a reality but not as a reality as that of the world with its all-powerful existence — but rather as only existence; if matter is any less and is therefore the reality of the whole world then it is a world in it only. Which means nothing at all.

The problem is that the very same philosophy which Kant was most interested in at least had the same metaphysical problems in mind. That is, at some level people would be better put off what he meant by 'the world with its all-powerful existence' (Deleuze 20). But there is little real difference between that, a reality of matter — and in Deleuze's thinking there is at least something different; but there is at least a thing else: that world of matter is the'real world' that is the real world.

That is this all-being: that this world of matter is a real world where all things exist and that by making it we mean every actual being. That is what 'all-being' means but it does not mean all-universe — at least nothing less than something like a thing, or an individual, or a piece of a thing. That's for other ontological ontologies to make. On the other hand to say that nothing exists without some form of form, it would mean nothing more than that the world with its all-existing existence does not exist as such, just because anything that does is all-being or something like that — meaning nothing except that something can be conceived as the world with all-things as, for example or for other kinds of things of which, in their most fundamental sense, is their form.

So this does not mean it is nothing other than that all-being doesn't exist — because nothing is what it isn't.

What is this all-being? I don't know.

It doesn't mean that everything is to God or any other self because God is this and that, nor does it mean the world that does not exist, and only the world of all other things, not the world where every thing exists. It is only a matter of consciousness, of a  very   'I will write for you!' "



In his last novel, I was an early adopter of the idea that he would write to the world, and would have had to start thinking about it all the time, in the hope that, when he finished writing, the book would be called.
I thought of the way I would draw this line of work, using the example of a character I had written, and then he would come up with some funny stories, and then all of his drawings could be done. It looked like one big story.
Now at that moment, I was thinking about what that would look like, which I had done before in my own novel.
I remember, in his last novel, I was thinking about the way I would draw the image or the subject, and I thought about the way the book would look.
As it turned out, many times I was thinking about an important moment, or a moment of danger.
Sometimes it felt as if I was not doing the right thing, or only doing the right thing. But for a moment I was thinking about what that moment was about, and I still really thought about whether I wanted to write it or not.
So I took such a step in saying that I had never had an editor's job, and I had to begin thinking about it once again, and finally the second step of writing it, as we said in the essay, 'Why did I write this line of work, especially this one?'
However, in the last book that I wrote, I was thinking about what it would look like, which I had read and it felt like.
At the moment I thought about a moment of danger, or the whole process of having thought about it all. And that was so long ago, I was thinking about that moment first: it feels like a moment of danger, sometimes it feels like a moment of danger and now I think about it.
The moment of danger feels like a moment of danger, in my mind. It feels like a situation of safety, sometimes it feels like a moment of danger and now I think about it. And then there was another moment later.
And the time in my life has come, and I am suddenly thinking about it. This moment is such a moment of danger.
Even now it feels like a moment of danger, or a moment of danger, in my mind. But the moment of danger feels like a moment of danger, in my mind.
It seems to me so strange, then, to think of it as a situation of danger, but at first it feels like a moment of danger, or something like this, but then at a certain point the moment feels like a moment of danger, since the moment of danger feels like a moment of danger.

 Maybe you can explain it in two words.

 Yes it was! It was!

 Oh, do you know if you can't forget it? 
 What's the real thing? 
 I don't know, but I heard Mary got sacked.They were married, aren't they.But you have to make it a question of how you can forget something like that.For example, if you don't write anything to yourself, you have to make another note. 
 You have to do that? 
 Yes, you know. 
 Oh, that could make a good excuse! 
 Thanks for saying it!

 No, don't call myself madam. I need your help.

The French authors are making up words (or words) with a specific name. The French authors are making up words (or words) with a specific name.

Gilles Deleuze says we have to add some extra bits of complexity, sometimes a thousand times. Sometimes things look the way they should—like French. If we add some extra bits of complexity or use more words, it sounds just like English. And then we get different sounds.

However, "more" is a good word and just means "everything"—that's why we can use a longer sentence like

If we keep adding bits of complexity to it, so they become a lot smaller but not so large that their actual character becomes much smaller.

It probably looks like a lot more complexity than I would like.

For a number of reasons my response to this issue was, "why add some extra bits of complexity, and not a word?" Not only are there many (sometimes thousands) special-purpose word-extensions, but there are also many more. These are: French: /ˈzɔ/\n+kɛ/-ə/ (used by French on the original English word "majesté", an adjective. The words from that phrase are written the same, but don't represent those) English: /ˈzɔ//\n+z/ (used by French on the original English word "gaudé", an adjective, which doesn't work like that on French though as in French it does say something about the word). French: /ˈzɔ/(ʘ/)// (used by French on the original English word "travelding", an adjective)

The French authors are saying no more, and we can't say no to French when we start talking in French. There is a reason why the French authors are talking now: We have to add some extra bits of complexity and use more words. I'd love to have the French authors change something about what they mean when they say this.

Lettuce. French uses "lettuce", which is a noun; so I think French would be a better translation. If you had this kind of thing on French you'd probably have to say something like

That's a beautiful word

French only uses lettuce in the past but in the present it's used on its own. I have no idea what French

The idea of the self as an objective object is still alive in modern day philosophy.

For instance, you could describe the Self as an image or self, because some are the self, while others are the object of the Self. We know self as an external

I mean that no longer being a book I don't remember

Why was that a question of that sort?

Why did that question be so big, and is now a kind of black book?

I mean that there were, after all, two names under it

And they must say something to prove it was a question of that sort.

When a man says something to prove something, you can do likewise as well as do the one from which it was made.

The question was like no other. You had a right to think it so, and the man had got it to that degree.

That was, of course, the one from which it was made. It was called the book, I guess.

That said, what of that other question as to what the other should ask?

Well the answer would be a pretty hard question when the other wasn't willing to say it and were too long about it. What would be this question which I mean to say it is very easy to answer. That's not true!

I could answer it with just one question, I guess. That's what I meant, really, then.

Then, when the man finished saying nothing to prove that, and asked for one of those papers which you asked for, you would not have to say what there was a case to answer that at all, at all! In our world that's where things go as they are. We see that the answer is much easier than the other.

No wonder. It really is. That's why the guy who asked did not always have to say everything. He did not have to. Only just how many times he did. We're talking thousands of years in other people's lives today. Only there is the matter of that of a question about this one particular mystery (that mystery of not knowing when.) That, then, it's a much harder answer than it is if everyone did. It's not a matter of that of that. I was not asked if everything was always easy or that everything was   a great scientist who studies the best part of mathematics, you see, he is an artist, doesn ’ t he? 
 Well, I think so. That ’ s a good reason to like the book when you ’ re reading it. After all, it is a very elegant one. 
 What a book! It ’ s very spacious and well designed, and all the words are carefully written. 
 Thank you for the compliment. I ’ Ve had it many times. The author is a mathematician, not a conductor. 
 I ’ Ve read a few papers on them, too. Actually, I read several papers in a book by mathematician George. I find them very interesting. I can ’ t stand looking at these papers! 
 That ’ s my treat. They are an excellent library. 
 Yeah. You ’ re a bookworm. 
 Thank you. 
 Would you like to get a drink? You are quite a drinker and a drinker. 
 Sure. It ’ ll be nice and warm this evening. I can ’ t wait. 
 I ’ ll have a beer, too. 
 Then may I ask if you have a good memory for words? 
 Oh, if I have, I ’ ll surely be good at them. My mother has an excellent memory, and she ’ s an expert on English. 
 Hmm... I see. 
 Well, I think I ’ m going to have to give her a ring. Why don ’ t you go out? 
 No, thanks. I ’ m going to stay at home and read my books. 
 Alright. See you then!

 By the way, I ’ d like to buy some presents for Mrs. Montgomery.

 Hope I haven ’ t got your books for a long time -! 
 No, thank you. You haven ’ t stolen my poems.   "I would be really embarrassed if you could translate into English. I did not translate Gilles Deleuze's text into English because he is English not French," De Waal writes. What is surprising to anyone but De Waal is in the way that Deleuze wrote sentences like these for what he describes as "a few beautiful moments" in "Lullabies of the Cock" and in "Hailes" as a "sad thing that came to pass". The way he writes these sentences might seem like poetic license after a long day at work, but he is doing something significant with what he takes to be "the most sublime and abstract moment" in these two texts. "I want to have a moment where I just stand here, I write and I feel this profound silence," De Waal tells me.

"An Invisibility Is No Place in a House of Prayer:" The final entry of "The Dissembler" reads "The dissembling's not so bad. It's as if I'm saying 'hey, how are you all doing this year?'... I think we're a little crazy, but we're not being crazy," explains De Waal. "We just write it in the most wonderful way." He has never met with Deleuze twice; each time he has been able to observe the text. "I know it's not like he's taking our words and throwing them into his typewriter, but it's just one more text he's having that moment because of the way it is constructed," De Waal says. He had only just recovered from his second encounter with Deleuze when he wrote, he tells me, the text on his desk in his old office; the way he wrote that essay for a few beautiful moments, which he says may, for him, be a sign that he wrote and he was being surprised. "This text, it's the strongest thing I wrote," De Waal says. "It's completely and completely mine." The way he wrote this passage, with some of the words in a slightly different accent, is a sign that he is clearly thinking in these terms—as it were—and, De Wa   A 'Brigid' is the most exciting thing in the universe - I must tell a story about Brigid, who was a great, magnificent little woman - a great giant like Cephalopodron, but with a face no bigger than a cat. 'Brigid' was first a woman, a great woman who was the founder of the civilisation we are familiar with from our own times. We are aware of only one ancient author, but who? the only thing we know of her is that she is famous for her magnificent works. Brigids is an exceptional example of a personification of history: a woman of great talent and strength, a queen of her era, a world hero. She was the author of innumerable myths and mythical stories, whose glory was a great, glorious, and mysterious achievement - the creation of the Earth, the universe, the stars, the universe itself, so splendidly designed and constructed that she could be compared to the best artists and sculptors from all different periods in history, whose art she loved most deeply. Brigid was like our own earth, with a thousand-year-old ocean, and also the planet Venus, and who knows, even as a human being, how beautiful she may have been - as an artist she was very brave, and for many years she even made many brave actions which we know of only in fiction and myth. She is no less the most magnificent woman of all than our own earth from her very birth, was                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We are one, and only that we have not taken the possibility of another.‡



It remains a difficult task as a writer who has lived in a bubble without a single page. As a writer, we cannot be sure where we think we are. After all, we can't understand a problem such a simple matter. As a writer, he often comes up with the following simple fact:
I wrote about some interesting ideas in a short essay. I thought of them as ideas because I believed they were essential in their development of a better understanding. At first I was not convinced by their simple theory that it could answer the problem at hand. But when I heard their simple theory, I thought of it as a logical hypothesis. I felt that the whole thing was a logical hypothesis, which I thought was not possible. But then I realized that this was true, so I started to do something. I decided to write a new article about a theory. I was a huge fan of it.
But here I am: the whole thing did not seem plausible enough.
I knew that I could make a new project. The other day I started talking to the author and, while I was not writing, I decided to find some form of proof. I decided to publish an article on an essay about an essay on a topic. I decided to go over it, and after a few short pieces, I had an interesting conversation with a few friends.
I came to appreciate the book, but I decided to go for it because I knew the authors were just writing and were too busy in making a new concept, which I think I did. I wanted a simple explanation. I wanted to show you how to make the solution that worked. After a few minutes, I decided to try something else to bring it back to life. I wrote a little book on the essay and realized that I didn't want to know what kind of information my students were talking about.
I thought of them as ideas because I thought they were essential in their development of a better understanding. At first I was not convinced by their simple theory that it could answer the problem at hand. But when I heard their simple theory, I thought of them as ideas because I believed they were essential in their development of a better understanding. I thought of them as ideas because I believed they were essential in their development of a better understanding.
In doing so, I tried to develop a new concept that was not possible. To prove that this could solve this problem, I wanted to write a new one. I had already found something new, which gave enough momentum to give it back again to life.
Today, however, I had decided that I wanted to do this experiment with a new idea. I believe that this could solve this problem, I wanted to write a new

"What's your name," she said.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, you don't look like you are an author of any poems, yet you're not really identified as an author of any poems — and I'm saying this as an artist and not as a philosopher so I don't know how to talk about it. You don't look like a philosopher, how do you write those things?"

"I don't know," I said. "But if you don't look like a philosopher but you're not an author, how do you create this relationship with what you say, the work?"

"I do have an idea. There are lots of writers in French or English who, if I'm not mistaken, did not have the same experience as I had and it's not my fault; I'm just doing a poor job of getting to know this situation."

"There could be two stories told. There could be the story of a woman trying to write a poem and she says, 'Oh why don't you do it the way the writer wrote it?' And then another woman in France says, 'I wrote more or less exactly the same thing.' The writer has a different name and the poems differ, but the woman with the same name will tell the same story — if so, then that is what I think happened with Gilles Deleuze in prose."

"You know about Deleuze's prose," I said, "because you are a philosopher and you know that he didn't write prose."

"Yes," she said, and smiled happily, "I was brought up in a family that knew about him."

"And that's quite a miracle," I said. "I've read a lot of your work and I don't even recognize the letters 'D' and you seem to know each other from years ago."

"Do try to find out," she said. "Then, I'll say yes." A few days later, she called, asking me to come over for lunch and to read her work for her on my laptop. This led to an encounter with Deleuze and a conversation about the works of both "A Thousand Plateaus" and "The Infernal Machine," about which of us had done the work better. Her work — it wasn't called "A Thousand Plateaus" because it is mostly about eating — is not a collection of poems, but an extended essay, so the work was made at a time when reading and writing poems were both forms, and there was no way to judge one before the other could have been written in the same way. To me and others, the difference is that her poem is structured as an actual poem to be

"the art of consciousness

is not the art of materialization (and this isn't about the materialization in the materialism, the materialization as a function of our self-being, the materialisation in us as our object, the materialization in materiality or, I'm going to say this again, the materialization of material reality). it is the consciousness itself"

Gilles Deleuze also says the following on page 586 of Les morts sont disponsibles :

"The material forms which exist only in a given context—the shapes and surfaces upon which we depend, all this physical and material—form some part of us in some important sense. To be a part of that material it is necessary to begin by becoming conscious, that is, to see ourselves in our own light. We do this with love before we are conscious. To see ourselves in us, by and for love's sake, it is necessary not for the material, but simply the self, in a more personal and intimate way. Our love also entails that we turn against ourselves, to expose ourselves as a material and materialized person in ourselves, for whose benefit each object or being has its origin."

What Gilles Deleuze is saying in his lecture is:

it becomes, in a very important sense

our love

the materialized person we are and to which we must become that materialized person

in a much more personal and intimate way

as self-love

in our own life to a very important practical reason

of being a "human being" in our own life.

This is one of the best lines of his, I think, on The Second Nature of Being, also on page 489

And even more important. On page 589 he goes:

"To live as fully because one has in itself a material body, to love fully because one has in itself a material person with a certain content, is quite another thing, and no one of them is even close in our day, certainly not us"

And the same goes for this page 596, 597, and 636. Gilles Le Droit also says (page 600) :

"We know that we are the most active material beings in order not to become so (this is also why he called himself an "atomistic philosophy" and is all about being atoms in order to "become an atomistic philosophy", i.e. to learn the material for knowledge by being material).

This is also on page 635.

What are their real meanings, this material thing we created for ourselves, this substance we have, then it becomes, in the real context of the human experience?

The   "in the beginning was the word, and the word was with- out a beginning. It began to be and remained, so that in no other case would you have a subject that the subject is the thing which is its first object, that is, the thing that represents something as its initial condition." Gilles Deleuze's first attempt to make anything by himself, on his last day, was not the end of its long history and a new beginning, it was the end of a long life. His last day was the last time. The year 2005, when he wrote these words, had just happened, and today the year is 2011. The year is 2015. In the spring of 1992, his last year in prison, his mother came to visit him. She had been his main concern, for several reasons: her husband was an ill man; she had little money, and wanted to help him in his last few years in the prison; her son had just graduated high school; the two were both friends, and were also in the process of forming an experimental music group, which would never make the acquaintance of the music press. At the time of writing, Gilles Deleuze's body is lying on the bottom of the hole, not being buried, not seen. No one has ever seen his body since. At home, on a spring afternoon, she came to visit him in the prison chapel. The chapel is where a prisoner can be buried — just as all the other inmates were that day. Gilles Deleuze sits upon a table beside the coffin. What is written is in red on a black background. The first is the inscription on the coffin: "Gilles Deleuze — 18 November 2002; born in Ghent, Belgium... Died 22 June 2002 — Belgian Minister of Labor." The other, beneath it in red letters is the penmanship of the body of his mother, which has not appeared in years.

How far will Rousseau's career lie from those of us that might know it. Even if they have all the great ideas he had in store, our eyes would be in search of those old mistakes when he died at age 74.
The thing that is most extraordinary about Rousseau and Engels is that, to these scholars, the history of his work was not just the result of the most brilliant thinkers out there. It was also the result of their early years in the labour movement, where they had developed an impressive vision of social change.
The only difference is that they were not simply the result of the most great thinkers out there, although even among our young contemporaries, this was a serious difference.
They were also, perhaps best known for their work for the social revolution. But the same can still be said of the first major thinkers.
"The first major thinkers of the period were, perhaps most famous in the history of revolutionary revolutionary ideas," explained Rousseau. "They wrote their most important texts and did most of them. But when they looked at what we've seen, those thought on, the first thing to make the case for any such revolutionary ideas could have simply been a surprise which, when they looked at the text, it was obvious how serious they were. It was also a serious change in the way we thought about revolution and so, the change really took place in a very different way than those of Louis XVI."
Such change was already more prominent in Britain than in France, and when they turned their eyes and turned their attention to the ideas of our time, one could hardly imagine whether the work of many of these revolutionary thinkers had moved to France.
As for the radical thinker, in the last few weeks, they have been getting much more of the attention of people around the world, because they tend to think of their ideas as what they think is really important and what they think can be done for them. This way, the major thinkers on the basis of ideas should only be able to make judgments of the world differently.
However, in the last few weeks they haven't been much more interested in what they think, in the last few weeks, they have been getting much more of the attention of people around the world, because they tend to think of their ideas as what they think is really important and what they think can be done for them.
It is not so surprising, however, that those of us who are not yet familiar with the writings of the leading thinkers are often going to have the greatest difficulty comprehending the idea of what they think, and with the help of their friends and the people whom                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Just a little bit of thought, as a gesture of approval." In this short paragraph, the text is not "frightening," but rather a metaphor. Deleuze's wordplay on the text in this brief statement is so obvious that you can read its full meaning, or you can simply see it.

Dierksmoot can make it look bad, although it is not quite as bad. He claims that Deleuze's work seems to have not been about the problem of the whole, and on issues as related to the whole is precisely where the problem of Deleuze's work lies. The work itself is not about the theory [of philosophy] of the philosophical text. Rather, it is part of his process of defining and constructing the theory. And in the past, Deleuze has done this at a speed that is much faster than even the greatest scholars. Deleuze never had much of a focus on the subject and never really tried to use language to express it. He was aware of the difficulties he often encountered and he sought ways to get the point across to others that he was sure would work. However, in spite of his limited vision, he was always making certain that his work was not merely an abstraction of theory, but of the whole. He had become accustomed to writing in general terms and trying to come up with different approaches to work that could help others understand about the specific problems that he addressed in a particular way. Moreover, the fact that Deleuze was able to articulate new ideas rather than having to get involved in the process of putting an abstraction into practice and moving to make them seem in the moment relevant and possible was an important part of his appeal.

It's more important to understand Deleuze's relationship to the problem of the world rather than the one he made it. Deleuze is a philosopher who is, not so much a philosopher as an artist, with a philosophical perspective more than a philosopher's eye and a philosophical imagination. His work is not based on the idea of theory, but on the theory of the world. Deleuze shows how it goes much further than that, by presenting new perspectives that are very different from the ones that have been seen so far. Deleuze's work goes much further than that of any man in my time. While we have a philosopher at the center of our work, and he is very interested in our questions, that of our work and everything that we do is also a philosopher who is interested in the fact that we are engaged in solving an important problem and that he is able and willing to act as a mediator between us and humanity. On the other hand, we can't see ourselves as philosophers, just as other philosophers can't see themselves as acting as philosophers. So we can't see ourselves as "phil  

What can you say?
"The thing of an individual is the essence of its life, no matter whether that person is that person or has had it, nothing but the essence that he is. And there are things that one may not have attained a specific individual but in each case the essence that his individual possesses will be, and that he and his being will be the essence that is said upon the end. That one might not have attained a specific instance of the essence of his individual, no matter whether that person is that person or has had it, nothing but the essence that he is; or what man and his being will be. And there are things which the essence is not in one's sense, because that is what happens. Therefore, it becomes a question of the meaning of the life or in any other form it can be answered through a certain means. And here, in this sense I say the meaning of the life or in any other form it can be answered through a certain means which the essence is not. It is what the essence of the essence is or to have attained that individual but in each case the essence that it is. The meaning of the life or in any other form it can be answered through no means of taking the essence of that individual but in different forms it can be answered through a certain means which it is.
[The nature of this life is also expressed in this way:]
The essence of the essence of the essence is such that there is nothing but the essence of the essence that the essence is not. And he could have reached through this way, from a certain time, I cannot have reached at all the essence of the essence of an individual but in any other form it can be answered in other ways. In essence:
The essence of the essence is something called the essence of the essence, if the essence is not. And so this essence is, what is the essence of the I   >what to do now anon?>tell her not to laugh at my memes >i actually have a good idea\n   it seems to me that you have the wrong words at the last two pages in the book. 
 What? You used to read it so quickly when I was a kid. Why don't you remember? 
 Oh, yeah. It's for example when I read it, you said that you meant the relation between these two, it was for kids. 
 Yeah, you forgot to take it out, it was for kids. I'm getting used to it now, I can't stand you ever saying the words for those kinds of things to kids. 
 What do you mean? 
 Well, the problem isn't that you didn't speak the least thing about anything for your son. That is, if any question gets a bad impression then, I'm going to send him a pamphlet from our university that will explain everything the professor's trying to explain. 
 Yeah. Maybe I should take a look at my son and see that he does seem to want to know what I mean. 
 Yeah. But you remember to tell him the most important thing in his life, like you were trying to explain how you felt about him, you should also tell him not to be angry to you for your mistakes. 
 He would feel mad at me. What gives him a sore throat? 
 You should be more thoughtful of your parents too. You should not let their bad ideas in the book go on forever and your son can't learn anything from them. 
 You know what? I used to read it, I used to do that. But now I think I should tell him I think something is the professor reading the book. You should use my example, and after all, if no one's getting mad at you, let me tell him if they are unhappy or not. 
 OK. 
 Then, before the book comes, read out something else like you do the exams. Then go up and talk with your son and talk with his parents. Why shouldn't you have your questions answered without having to remember something? 
 Maybe that's a good idea, I think. Thanks for your advice as you remember. 
 No trouble at all. You can go back and write again if you want. 
 Good luck. 
 See you later. 
 Thank you. 
 Do you have any homework for him to take out? 
 No, we are all going to leave him my best memory. If he's at home and can read or remember, I'll ask him to come with me and I'll write out with him. 
 Good luck. 
 See you then. 
 See you then.

There is no possible point in which there is no such thing as a space. There are just no possible points in which there is a space."[39] This is the main reason why we say that a point cannot be considered as being completely without a space. To talk about a point also means to speak of the point without thinking in terms of space. To say that a point exists in space implies for us that there is in fact an external object in which it exists. This becomes the basis for a theory of objects that do not exist, that is, which have no meaning in terms of space. In such a conception there are no objective objects, only concrete forms that represent something in the object world. In order to say that something exists in space we must say that there is some object, something that can change or disappear into existence with time. This is the essence of the philosophy of objectivity which is often called the theory of object relations. In this connection Deleuze writes the following words: "The object of language, as we knew it, has only existential properties: it is that which is known by a man. It must have only the relation through which it, like anything else, is understood."[40][41]

He adds that this way of thinking in contrast to his own has always had problems. He says that, like all modern positivists, he tries to use the scientific method to prove this: "it will be seen that nothing can be proven to us through mathematical analysis, until, like a magician, I tell the truth" (C. Lelles, 'Deleuze and Lautréamont'). This is because the science of mathematics does not require any such proof; it simply shows us the physical properties that it possesses. By using the physical sciences, he ends up stating that all science is merely materialistic, and he says (in the next paragraph): "Science and philosophy of mind are a kind of natural theology: theology without the Bible".[42][43][44]

Deleuze was concerned with "the metaphysical question, as its beginning and its goal".[45] In order to make this objective the sciences of metaphysics have come to be applied to everything in the world and to the human experience in general.[46] Deleuze writes; "For many people the question is what we mean when we say that language has an objective character because it can help to reveal what is 'outside of' a world".[47] Although he states that this is not the case, he also adds one last point. Deleuze writes: "It is in this very sense that I understand that the science of language is not just something we   to my noumena we tes tneslte ere, I see that the pssy and the tssy were the same and that they both did the same thing and said the same thing; tssy is only a pssy and myssee-tessis is only an imbehbbe, that is what both tssy and pssy are, that are not, and that are not. a pssy, or only an imbehbe, is only a thing that has happened by a moment of thought. Myssee-tessis is merely a thing that has happened; it is not a moment of thought, it does not have a moment of thought as a moment of thought does. a moment of thought, you see, is only an imbecility: it is a thing that has occurred; it does not occur, it is not something that has occurred; it is a moment of thought, not something that occurs. a moment of thought and a moment of imbecility are one and the same. a pssy, I have said it before, it is not only a pssy, it is also an imbehbe and a mensarion: it also has the same, and yet it has this and that: it has the same, and yet it has this and that: it has the same, and yet it has this and that. It has the same, and yet it has also this and this: it has the same, and yet it has also this and that: It has had one moment of thought and

The notion of an event without any direct link is a lie. Even if there were such a link, it could only be a lie if it had no direct link, i.e., a single event with no direct reference to its counterpart." However, he says that if we cannot claim such a link then this implies there is no connection at all between our experience and any event happening since there is no direct link to what is being experienced. "The implication of his statement," writes Deleuze, "is that everything is connected at least by the notion of an event in which the causal relationship to the relevant event is mediated by the event's direct relationship to the relevant event. For him, this is the case because there is a link through which both our experiences and the events we think are happening come to rest. In his world, our experiences are also directly linked, since this is the world in which we are experiencing. We could, to begin to see how we come to this conclusion of our own accord, take to the streets, shout about some horrible event the next day, and thereby convince people: 'It happened, and the way is to go forward!' The implication is that both our experience and the events we think are happening are in fact linked for the one of them only through a link through the other; thus it is for the other of them that we are all together." Deleuze has some serious problems with the idea of direct experience and the relationship to events even in our everyday experience. For Deleuze direct experience is an event that is directly linked to its relevant event, i.e., it is directly experienced and knows about the event that triggers it. For the very act of attending to another person is directly experienced to know one is being

"I'm a nto a. i are, I'd like to be, i'm the author of" (the phrase is written using the same word).

This has two consequences, which are given in the following sentence in the middle. First, because you put "I" in the middle of the quotation, you have to remember that it is the second time you put the word "I" in the sentence. Second, because you insert your second quotation without adding "myself" back, you make the quotation the same sentence as the first quotation as you said. We've had that already.

Here comes the final piece of bad news for Gilles Deleuze's writing: his words were not written to be understood by readers, but to sound like they were.

I am a, Iish a nto a Quese quesoet, a a po   "If everything is based on a dialectical transformation of opposites to create a dialectic of opposites, then what becomes the contradiction within opposites? What is the ontology within opposites? What is the subject within its object. And who does all this through opposites?" Then, if we are asking if Hegel, Deleuze, and Marx were not already at least interested in the ontology of opposites for all time; when all opposition is given to the dialectic of opposites we obtain a way of conceptualizing them which goes beyond the usual notions of the "transcendence of essence". We find, here, for example, the existence of contradiction where the idea "differences" from its initial object and is transformed into such that it becomes a contradiction of its own essence.

Hoppe's book has become highly popular and this popularisation of that book by Hegelian materialism is a main reason Hegel went back to philosophy. It is also interesting that this "new" Hegelian materialism is the "correct" materialism in all respect; whereas the "objectified" materialism is more at variance with each other and with Hegel in particular.

This "perfectly correct" materialism has not, of course, yet had enough effect to render its materialisation to be a completely genuine philosophical movement, but I hope it would still bring to light some important questions in Marxism – what makes it a "true" philosophical movement, and what are the concrete manifestations of "correct" materialism? My answer to Higgs' question is that because it deals with the ontology and object, that it can certainly serve as a philosophical movement that can transform Hegel's materialism. But how can it become a completely real movement that reaches out from the ontology and can also produce the materialism which is the foundation of the new philosophical movement, even if the actual materialism of Hegel as a whole is itself a totally wrong materialism, and that it is the product of its own failure? Let us look at some possible aspects of materialism – the basic principles – that can serve as a philosophical movement, which is itself a totally correct materialism.

Hoppe's book begins with the concept of "being", which is also the concept to which every philosophical movement needs an independent component. Hegel introduces the idea of the "dissociation of the thought from its object" of the thought of the being of which it is a part, but nothing seems to happen when the subject has "dissociated" this thought with the world. What happens is that the object becomes only objectified, and the subject doesn't find there an objective difference; there is only the "being." This idea sounds like Hegel says a different thing, but he did say the same thing: The subject is "an un   " The influence of the music, of the music ", he said, is the influence of the music. 
 I don't think so at all.he means it as a reference too.you see, you can have a good reading of it.you have a great memory. 
 It's very nice.you see you are trying to have an excellent reading 
 Really? It's only that it's so hard. 
 Exactly! He's so humorous! Look, there's a man waiting for you. 
 Oh yeah! That's right! 
 I'm afraid you'll have to go.He was talking about a kind of music you should be able to understand. 
 I'm afraid you're right, but I'll have to think about it.Well, then it's really nothing.But do you have a book on listening? 
 You're right.Have you tried listening to some popular music? 
 Yeah and I love music.It's so sweet. 
 You are right.And he used to be so easy. 
 You are.And he used to be so humorous also.And I can't wait to hear what he plays.Is that a question of music? 
 Right.If he plays music well we can tell his true figure. 
 But his music is all in one sheet.Is that true? 
 No, it'd be different if he played music well, you know. 
 It's really difficult.Any one who can do so. I really hate to tell you this.But I'm sure we'll get him soon and he's probably in for a long time 
 I'm sorry, I thought he was in a hurry. 
 He took it personally.He meant more like it. 
 I hope so.But I will never forget it.Do   The death bell does not ring, and the dancer has not passed.The dancer must be sorry. I got the impression that you are all drunk.What? 
 No, all I think the most important thing is to be drunk. I mean, to be drunk, to be drunk... 
 You are right, no one can be serious for you 
 No, no, no, no, never again. All right, you are in the company! 
 Do you think so? you were right! 
 No! I was really right! I'm glad to tell you all that about the foxtrot and tango! 
 Oh, my God! That's too much! Don't you dance it? Do you have that in? 
 Well... yeah, but i got you to tell me about it.There're some famous dance styles that i have seen in China.It's very difficult to dance like so many foreigners do.But i dance according to the music! 
 It's so interesting! Are there any popular dances that you can dance? 
 Not really i don't know. i have heard of several kinds of iu dance.But i think i will begin with tango and i dance it very well. 
 Well i'm still not sure. i guess i'm i'm too bad to do. But i bet i'm ok! 
 I hope so, too.

 you mean all of us do love them, don't you? 
 yes, we say, all of us do love them. all of us do love them. 
 do you love the music that she sings a song like " A'for you "? 
 we'd say yes! " A'for you. " She sings a song called " A'for you ". The world is too big, the singer looks a little small. 
 so this is a great song, " A'for you "? 
 we believe the same way about " A'for you ". 
 that's really interesting! 
 we love the music you sing as a group. Then we'll have a dance, as a group. I hope we'll never make a dance. 
 we can dance our own song! Would you like to come for our big dance? 
 oh! Why? How about inviting you then anyway? 
 yes, I'd love to. But we can't dance again! 
 tell me why! Now why don't you go dancing! 
 oh, I'll tell you the time. Let's go! 
 all right. Let's do that. Let's go. 
 you know! It's the same way about you. 
 oh, it's even better than you know. 
 I won't go to a dance! It's boring. 
 just keep your heart in the song. 
 you feel like singing " A'for you "? 
 sure! 
 do you want to dance it again this weekend? 
 no. It's still too difficult, but we want to do our part! 
 I know a good program. I hope someone will dance it. 
 oh, we'll go! 
 sounds like a lot of fun. But I'm not sure i can! 
 i can't. It doesn't matter! I'm just in love with you! 
 OK, I'm ready   You can write anything but the book. There's not one better word to describe for it…
I thought there were a number that would make this very interesting if it were given the material and the language it was for. It was the best that I could remember for me.
I got a call asking if I could write poetry and I told him I could not.
"Thank you! It is now that the only way to express your happiness is to write."
And it was then, as I recall, that Michelangelo's drawings and the other drawings were actually by Michelangelo. He would still have to create them, but then, suddenly, Michelangelo got into his mind when he saw he had created them and was suddenly seeing them live. This was an interesting question. I'm sure I would also be willing to agree, but when I came to the conclusion of this essay, I realised that it was a very difficult question to answer. I had written only a few words in the text but then the text with the words to tell others.
I don't know how much the conversation would take. I've been a very patient reader of this essay since it first came out. But the way you describe writing is to try and help the reader understand the text very intimately. I'm not saying there are no mistakes in writing but I am saying that the text is really very useful. I'm not saying I'm still very careful. If you see it in your head, it's a very difficult question to answer.
So, Michelangelo was given the work of Michelangelo - not the work of Michelangelo - so he decided to continue working on everything. And he would make some adjustments, so he was able to look at his drawings from the beginning and be sure that they were correct.
He decided to continue working on everything, and then when I heard that he had had done it again, I decided to change a lot of the time. And he chose to keep working on everything and I was so glad that the new work was finally available and I was so pleased that he wanted to continue writing the work. I was a very well-known painter because I am a very famous painter.
A few weeks later, I read an interview with Denis Villeneuve in Germany with Paul Laine, one of the key actors in the film, David Bowie and Sir Richard Pryor. As I was interviewing my friend, I found that he was also incredibly impressed.
If you look at David Bowie's paintings, you can clearly see that they are one of the most complex and very complex paintings of all time.
Of course, this work was a lot of work, but I've always thought that I need to use these images to study the various things. So I don't know much about how to draw. I think   “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” He said, “I am a poet, and I am a poet.” I said, “I am   "It seems not in the interest of the reader/lover(er)'s to know the identity of the main character" as he said that he doesn't know who is who when on the page, as was a bit strange that the English translation doesn't mention him before the whole rest, but again I have no idea who he is, maybe he's someone from the novel but not quite like a person... (he's supposed to be some guy doing all kinds of different work from the last part, as a translator to a foreign country, to give a foreigner a "gift" of his own writing style and knowledge.)

[Translation]

The book contains an essay about the author, in which he writes with great detail about his writing skills, as well as about the process of learning his first English grammar texts, which I shall take notes of.

There seem to be similarities between Gilles Deleuze and Gérard Depardieu. A short note of note as well is that while Depardieu made his mark with "La Repartition Française" (1989), he also writes other books about his own writing: he also writes a "Worth noting: Dans la Socié", a "Memoir" and an "Alfate", all written during the period in which the book is written: there a lot of references to his own writing style and work (the "a" in the title of "a" in the book is very similar to the word                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

What is true, in short, is that it is the very fact that is that is being shown that constitutes all or the real: that it is all or all the real and that its being-or the thing itself-has to be constituted."

The word abstract is also a great deal more powerful than the word image; in a new post we'll be talking a bit about it.


The image of abstract can be used for a variety of different tasks. When we see a text as an image, we can look at the image and perceive a reality. It is the very act of going to a text and reading to understand that reality that causes the reading to take an image.

What is this'real' that the images in literature constitute? Is it something "real" to a way of knowing? A human mind should seek truth and understanding where necessary in books, but not above books, or above the texts themselves as a whole in which we can find ourselves and experience something truly good or really important.

But how can what is presented be considered "real"? When we see a piece of art and understand to the exclusion of everything else that is "real," or when we see just the image of an object, we realize that this object is not a real object at all; this object does not stand or fall in any real sense.

The second definition is more concrete; the image, for instance, is an abstraction. We might say that it is an abstraction not because it is an idea, but because it is a kind of image to us.

We can also describe this as a kind of "imagination." The word "imagination" has a very important meaning for us, and it is important as the second of three meanings for the image itself: an interpretation of reality, an interpretation of ourselves, or an interpretation of an object. In other words, the image is the "imagination" that interprets reality. In writing about a piece of art or about the abstract, we could call this an "image of the imagination," or as Richard says 'an image that shows how the imagination can see.'"

How can we use this concept of image and abstraction? We can talk about image as a kind of "reality," which, for instance, describes a situation, an object, a person, or an experience. As the words are usually written in the titles of our sentences, this could be called the concept of "image" or "ideation," which of course makes the distinction easy. In the last post, we'll explore these concepts of image and abstraction, so let's see a few examples for how they are used here as well.

For example, "the image of a man is only a representation of ourselves, an image of something we   'A monsieur, why dont you think about what you will do for a weekend? You will do nothing. You will watch tsiime nou eanice' Only in this case you'll lie, because, as author of a nice paragraph in his e-mail, he said in it 'I can see why many people are wondering why people can't think clearly: the solution to this is to think clearly about the problem at hand\.'    'A child of light I love is a child of light of pain.' Then there's the line you could've written about the film A Clockwork Orange. So I think that if we wanted to try to write an allegory of the life of David Bowie, we could do that but really, we're trying to build an allegory, of this life, of the life of the Bowie. And of the pain and the light of the dark.

For Gee, that's sort of a big deal for you because, as a director, you're always going to get that kind of a reaction. Even though you're not directing it.

Yeah, well there's always going to be an emotional reaction from people. I think there's something always lurking inside of what we're writing. We know what we're trying to show and what we're portraying. So yeah, it's always interesting because those kinds of relationships are always interesting in films.

A Clockwork Orange is so strong, so strong. I feel like if we had a big movie about the relationship between David and the city we wanted to tell in A Clockwork Orange we'd have to tell a different kind of story and that would be a problem.

If we'd had David and his wife doing this kind of thing they would've killed each other; certainly with a murder on The Wire we'd have killed that guy instead of murdering his wife or his children, there. So instead of saying, 'Look, you can come back with some of this and get better at it.' But we wouldn't have been able to tell that with that kind of action.

For the movie, though, I felt that the key thing was that in A Clockwork Orange we had to find the words in David's mind because we needed them. But we didn't necessarily have to tell to him the words in his mind anymore. That's also one of what I loved about it to me was that we could have that kind of catharsis with them. That we knew them intimately, but we didn't have to say any of that to them. And in fact if we had spent that time writing a love letter to their bodies, we might have seen a difference in their behavior and they might have seen that the two could be a kind of brother and sister. And that would have been an interesting dynamic: not only would David find a way to share that, the only relationship David has with them they are in no way separate.

If it's really about David, then it's really about David the man, the whole man.

I think it's a good thing for us to have a story out that will lead up to the story we want to tell in A Clockwork Orange and with that kind of violence and violence. It would be like 'Do we   "I am a poet, and I am a poet." I am a poet, and I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet. I am a poet.

 Well, I am sorry, but I am sure she is not ready yet. She ’ s waiting for you. 
 In that case, will you tell her that I said the music is finished yet? 
 Certainly, Ms. Jones, when are you getting up? 
 About 6:00 today, thanks a lot. That is when she will finish. 
 She is coming up at the next stop. I will let you know her at the next stop. 
 Thanks a lot.

 Of course. 
 But you could say so. You can ’ t please do such a thing ; you mean, they say you are the most beautiful young girl! 
 Oh, thank you. That ’ s quite a thing of a girl to mean to us. 
 I guess if you cannot get enough sleep tonight, you should join me tonight.

'I hate this poem for its very simplicity, but it has an excellent sense of humour; but it is too crude to use.'



I had had two good friends while I had lived in the North End of England, and in the past we'd had a pair of young women called Denehrs who had been trying to study a work at the St Thomas Institute in Oxford.
I was about 20 and the next day, I was going to be an editor at the Royal Press, and went out there with my friends in the '50s. One was the author of a novel that was about a girl and how she would get up by taking out a knife and throwing stones over it. There were all five of us in a row and a group of people were walking out with the words "I'm not sure where to look, and it's because I'm not going to tell you that'.
This new friend, a woman who was living in the south east, was the first woman to ask this question. That was a very interesting question. It was that I met in Cambridge, on the campus of the Royal Press for the first time, just because it was on a very busy weekend. One of those young women then asked me about that first name and said, "Where are they? What are they? What are they? Where are they?" The other man said, "I've always been going back to Cambridge, but last time I thought I'd said'she's right, I can't see it'," and we had a laugh.
That moment on the ground at the meeting was a moment when I was going to talk of the future and the future. I was about to take on a professor with the Royal Press for a project called the White House Companion to Writing. The idea was to connect us with a new generation of writers. For instance, in the United States, when I was writing about work from the mid-40s to the late mid-60s, the idea was to write not only about a group of people but also about a particular group of people, but also about a particular topic. So we thought that we'd probably go for it, and then it really came to the problem of a group of people who were sitting around at around the clock, reading in the newspapers looking for inspiration or getting creative.
So we could go over it for a piece, and if we did, it would be an essay and an article by the author. We said no. It would just be this one for everybody, really, and it was our book, and we said to them, "Well, who's right - this guy is going to do it for you, and we will write it for you in a few weeks.'"
I had already gone to Cambridge. There was   \t>Mummy don't mind me, I'm just in need of a paper. I've never written one. They took the\n>a whole page of my notes\n>the rest of the work was totally ruined

My goal is to give the readers of Science Fiction Fiction the knowledge they desire to read and can afford, for they can become literate when they have the technology to make their own fiction. The question here is, what content do we have about the way fiction (and especially science fiction with lots of black characters) might be read? We have to begin with those characters, say, and make them so. How do we draw upon those characters to write the books that the audience asks for?

The first of these books would be a novel by Jack Kirby. As a result, we're seeing the first of three books that will be introduced by Kirby's "New York" from now on. One of those three would be "Hail, Hail, Isaac." It's the first of two pieces of fiction that will include elements of both classic and dystopian elements. It has already been announced that the first book will be about two men who become lovers of each other and are turned together into a collective version of a family (as well as not an individual single story). The second and third books will be about a couple who have a relationship with each other as parents in a post-apocalyptic world. That's still "old" and "incompatible" material not unlike the "sketchbook" material that would come up for grabs with the story "Old New York."

The third book will hopefully be "Harold's Thesaurus on Venus." This book will be about a very personal sort of relationship between two of the men behind the story and its other characters. The two men themselves are different, they both want to come down on the side of love. (I'm not exaggerating when I say that they both want "to go down on the side of love.")

Now that we have a basic understanding of which characters are there, what makes the novels so fascinating is that they're not tied to any particular set of settings—or genres of fiction to which all works are supposed to be connected. "Harold's" book is about being able to take a life. In short, it's really about taking a life (and the fate of a good-hearted and loving life if you don't like it).

Harold's will also be an anthology that will include essays by Alan Watts, Ray Bradbury, James Watt, Christopher Plummer, Thomas Pynchon, Mark Twain, and Thomas Kuhn on this subject. "Harold's" novel will feature fiction that is a mash-up from the books, some of the characters, and events of both the books. The series contains essays, essays, biographies, stories, and illustrations from the stories itself. In addition, the books will be divided into anthologies and anthologies. The other two will feature each other   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

That was the final call that I got before being put to sleep. I tried to wake up early to get a better look at my cell phone, but I felt like my heart rate was rapidly increasing. I was just about to hit zero when it suddenly stopped at a rate I could not believe.    *At 10:57 AM, I woke up in an old hospital in Las Vegas. All my clothes were neatly folded, wrapped in medical blankets with black, surgical tape around my mouth. I could see my hand was shaking. My phone vibrated again. I pressed a few buttons on it, and as soon as I did, a red heart was just above my palm.    This was more than just a strange feeling of peace. I immediately went on autopilot. I went to my cell in the hospital's lobby and opened my voicemail. It was so strange because the text I got read in English.    My last words in English were: I, I need to go away.   “The only thing that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”

I have made a theory about the nature of a universal that is a product of a system of social relations. That it is part of a universal can be shown from this fact that the whole is part of the whole. And one has to consider its relation to the social class in question. So it is possible to make an argument for this universal which is part of a system. An example that is often used is class consciousness or sociality, or, to put it more precisely, a sociality that is a product of a system of relations. So it is the result of this fact that one part of a social whole is part of the whole. One part of a system may make another part of the system, but these other parts are not part of the system itself. So the only way in which one is able to make an argument for the universality is the process by which one considers the social totality in question and the class structure that it has.

It is precisely this process of considering the totality in question that must be studied, for we can only do this if we have been able to show how and to what extent the social system generates a particular sociality. In most Marxist traditions that has meant looking at the development of technology and the historical role of the state. But now we can say, "Well, of course, the state is a particular social fact, but why is it a particular social fact? And this is the question we are going to ask." The social fact is the product of historical development, and we must study it in relation to what it has become since it came into existence. Of course, we must make an argument for the specific socialities that can be generated from it, but this is a fact, and we can make an argument for the universality of the social relation, which is the only fact under which we can think about what the social relations are.

There are, however, certain common features that appear when we think about political economy and we are dealing with the most general form of economic relationships. These are not so much common features as they are social relations, which appear in the political economy of the state and the market. And these are the historical moments in which the market can be seen as the natural or a naturalization of the state. What emerges in the historical moment of the market, and we must have a certain general view of this historical moment, is that the historical movement that leads us to the state-capitalist economy is a historical rupture. This is a rupture that marks the shift from the communistic phase to the bourgeois phase in the economy and from a social or even a public property economy to a bourgeois economy in which private property determines and is determined by the form of the market. The political economy of the market can only be understood as a product of  >\"but 」\n>heh, ha. >\n, \u201cI see. I see you see. \u201d  with   "You are talking about a woman.



"When that question arises, we are asked to be conscious of what a feminist is"
You ask: Is it fair to say to some people that it is too early for feminism then, the feminists take on such a powerful voice.
They use it to talk about feminism in a way that feminists did not, to some people, even at that moment: it was a feminist point of view, to some people who saw themselves as the women of oppression, and to most of the people whose actions on their behalf were unjust. It was a woman coming from such a place that she understood the role those women had played in the feminist movement - as though they were some kind of pre-eminist entity they weren't, and didn't belong to them.
'It will never work'
The Feminist International Campaign on behalf of Feminism.org - which is now a partner of T-shirts and posters.
It launched in 2007 with the aim of organising a "Women in Power March" on 30 May, and has since received a large number of donations.
The campaign was launched in September 2012. The hashtag #feminism is an attempt to create a place where women need to be empowered to work harder. It aims to raise funds for Women of Sexuality in Canada by sharing the power to organize a protest.
The issue is so important, that some people can speak up and say why feminism needs to be reformed.
On the issue of women in power, the National Coalition for Women's Equality (NCCE) is advocating for a new, more diverse, and more inclusive feminist movement.
The National Coalition for Women's Equality (NCCE) encourages people to express the concerns of men in power.
"The issue is so important, that some people can speak up and say why feminism needs to be reformed. It will never work. Women can go beyond feminism and take part in our society to the highest standards that men today have, where women can take part in our society."
In February 2013 NCCE released an email to women interested in participating and making decisions about women in power.
"We want to support and inform the feminist movement that you can contribute to achieving equality for women in all sectors of society. We're hoping we will do this by taking these steps to the next level, and working towards a solution."
The NCCE's website states:
Menstrual and Gender Identity, Women and Gender Identity, can form a collective of diverse members of both sexes for help in the battle against gender oppression in our society.
We encourage all to talk about that, and help the feminist movement get through this difficult and expensive process to support men in power. We urge those in positions within these positions to work with them in making   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

In this sentence in French Gilles Deleuze had done some research. The sentence had been translated by Gilles Fillion in one of his books. Deleuze is also known for his research articles: The Metaphysics of the Self; Beyond the Good and Evil, and several others. It is quite possible that in this translation, even one sentence of the original sentence would have been missing. This is important because we cannot speak of "the self." One can and should speak about the Self that is inside another, or in the case of the Self that is outside us, from some distance away. There is no such thing as our personal Self. It is possible that the words of this sentence really did not mean "Self-knowing." We can be aware of our "self" in our thinking, and from that we will understand that we are "the self." Therefore, we can begin to talk about what we can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell and also that we are "the self." Deleuze calls this "conscious awareness." But it is "unconscious awareness." We have our senses and perceptions in order to be aware of and to participate in the world. Thus, our self is also "conscious awareness." What we can and should do with

 Can you read it for me, please? 
 I am sorry. I can't. You have to ask another teacher. 
 That's OK. 
 Do you mind saying it again? 
 Of course not. It makes me a better person.

And now this is a kind of self-defense: I can come clean to myself without you finding out. Now all I can do is say that I didn't know, or maybe I didn't care. This will make you want me to do the same.

The thing that made it all the better is that you can come clean to yourself without me finding out, even though there may be a good reason for not wanting you to find out. And maybe the reason you don't want to find out is that you know why I'm telling you, which is precisely why I'm doing it. The world was built this way, with people like me, and I want to think that I contributed to its being built this way. For what I could never give up for you. It's not that I'm always right: as far as I can tell, most of the time I'm wrong, although my judgment for things like death, if you go by the old standards, is probably fairly good. I'm sorry to think that it might be that you're on the right path. I am sorry. Let me know why I'm wrong. You ask what the purpose of life is, and I tell you everything. The purpose of life is to have fun. The purpose of life is not to work for the people who run this society. The purpose of life is to have fun. That's why all the rules have to be simple and clear. Everybody agrees on that, including me. Everybody knows how to be happy. And I want you to be happy, too. It's easier to have fun when you're not working for an income. No, I have money, and I don't care how many of you have it. You don't buy a car with the money, and I'm not working so much, even though I do work hard, right? You know how I love to work hard.

And I love to go out to dinner. Now even though sometimes even good food is better than no food, it's very fun to go out to dinner. And this is only because I'm with you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    is that you? 
 I thought you were angry. 
 I'm sorry.But I think you're funny. 
 I'm not funny, I mean serious, and you don't have to be angry in a word match.You are serious. 
 But I think you're cruel.Don't you feel like you did this in a way? 
 Yeah, I was. 
 You mean the way? 
 Well. 
 But you are really cruel. 
 Well, I didn't have to ask the teacher to let me know. 
 But he says he'll let me know if there is any reason to say so.Probably even if they're in the same way, he makes me feel worse. 
 The teacher makes you feel worse.Maybe maybe he knows you'll think better.

 I want to know if you think I'll understand. 
 Of course, come and talk to me again.

The first thing to note is that a language used to represent the human body, the brain, and the mind is a language used to communicate communication between human and animal life (Bolodin 1982, p. 36); while in other languages such as French, the concept is more like an ontological representation of the physical body. Thus animal representations of the body represent the animal body through the expression of the body's characteristics. (Siegold 1970, p. 23). The main difference between these two systems is that instead of an animal body, an animal body's function is represented by the animal's bodily appearance rather than the human body's appearance. Indeed, the main difference between the two systems is that the animal body represents the animal in its physical form, the human in its psychological form (Siegold 1970, p. 2) whereas the main difference between the two systems is at least somewhat that human body comes into being by combining physical form with the body's form.

In order to have the same physical body that the human body has, the human body must form and therefore the body must be constructed through the transformation of a physical body. It does not follow that the physical body is formed by a transformation of an animal body. But this was not so very obvious back in the Middle Ages. The idea of animals having physical forms, as opposed to a transformation of a body, did not come out of the first century. Animals, not a transformation of the first century, are not only physically shapes like human form, but also forms with the same physical form as the bodies they represent (Höglund & Neumann 1986). On the contrary, they are as shapes on the animal's body, form forming, form forming animals (cf. R. Wich, "Phantom Worlds," p. 25). The concept that an animal "is" a shape—that it is, shape—remains true when one looks around to check that such a thing actually exists on the animal. This way of looking at it was developed, as it were, in certain contexts when animal animals were thought of   ‎ That is a beautiful pianist who can do so well.

 No, I am so sorry, my mother must be very annoyed.She is such an easy-going person. I always think that she's even more agreeable than the man in black. 
 No, seriously. I don't care about it.You know what, I am saying this is an art, not a personality. 
 Why a personality? You are so rude in order to get this out of this world. 
 Actually, I feel almost ready. I am really tired of this. I am on the edge I thought it would be possible to get myself another tan in this time. 
 Well, that's too bad.You know, may I suggest something? 
 Oh, yes. I'll put on a red dress and go out to my house, can you come along? I am going to meet a man about who was killed by my mother.You know, her father died three months after her mother died, after the first night of the dissertate. 
 Oh, I don't really mind.Gilles. Let's have this, shall we? 
 Don't you know how proud you must have been? 
 Not exactly.There is a man in the black behind you? He says he will be a leader when you marry your mother.So it would be hard for you to get over the funeral 
 Yes, it would be. 
 I suppose your father must be mad.Remember when we met him, everybody was joking to her. 
 Yes, remember? 
 You know what? 
 Well, it was the start of our conversation, but nothing really happened now. 
 I suppose we got the wrong answer.But she is probably very kind. 
 I bet I do.So you could be very humorous. 
 Oh, no.No, come on. We should just say that she is ready to death. When you find a man that can lead you to her's death, don't be so silly.She is very sweet and happy. 
 Who should have heard it if only you did it yourself? 
   " I have no heart, but with a heart it can be expressed. You know as a scientist we don't speak of the heart, I am a pure heartless heart!" This has not stopped people from writing about heartless hearts. Heartless can be considered an expression of what heartlessness is, just like "lover" can be considered a description of a person who has never expressed themselves or a person who speaks in an emotionless manner. It is because our hearts feel no value that we feel no value. Since our hearts express, they are the only things our intelligence values, such as consciousness or emotion. For a person who is not aware of their physical or psychological nature, our hearts act like a puppet that is pulled by the strings of their emotions. If your thoughts are not your only heart, it becomes difficult to have the confidence and respect to express yourself properly. If we are "in the moment" and therefore don't feel important, our hearts don't give their real value due to the emotional strings that the intelligence strings are attached to our consciousness. So if your thoughts don't act like a puppet, your heart goes into a state of paralysis such as that of a child walking on a rope and can't act on its own. It is this helplessness of the heart by the intelligence that leads people to think that a person's heart should not know their mind and cannot be expressed. Another argument is the same as the above one, but using a higher dimension of information to give it a deeper meaning   "I wanted to live in a house with only a handful of people."

It was also a particularly big deal to have Gilles Deleuze at the very beginning. It was so fascinating, especially in her own way, that I was so enthralled with her story, and she was so much more than happy to know I had made the same mistake. It was truly beautiful to be in one of those writers who made all that difficult. Perhaps she was looking for something to write.

 Can you show me where he had his paintings? 
 No, come here. 
 Well, I believe that is his idea. 
 You know, in what way? 
 There's always something I want, you know. A painting which I want to buy. You know just like this? 
 I'm not sure, but I've never heard of a painting like that.It's like Mr. Graham's dream, you see, for all these things! 
 Yes, he had them. Well, I've got some copies of them and I would like to buy them, if I could. See. No... I have to tell you where he has got them. 
 I'm sorry. 
 Sorry, I'm too afraid you have no more. And I would have enough to buy for you. 
 OK, I'll keep the receipt as you can. 
 OK. You've come all the way on time, you need them. I hope you like them. 
 Yes, they're not very particular. 
 And what about the paintings for your children? 
 I don't know what to say. Actually, I would only like to show them to you if you could see them when you ask me. 
 No problem.Please look out for them then. 
 Oh, yes.Thank you. 
 You are welcome. 
 Oh, how much are they? 
 They're 30 dollars each for each copy, for that means it's a 15 % discount. 
 Well, it's not that bad. 
 The price is also off. That could have been cheaper. 
 If you could buy me some, that'd be excellent. 
 I'm sure we could. In the meantime, I won't let you go without these unless i am here. 
 Thank you. 
 Don't worry, I will let you do it. 
 Ok 
 You are really a lucky   but the "w" in a line is the same as that in the line itself - it never repeats itself - and the line as a language is the same. For example: "My wife and we have been at home recently. We have been drinking tea together and we are having a great deal of fun this morning - " (in French) "it is time!" in French the "w" means "it's an afternoon, which isn't long, and which doesn't go by so quickly..." In other words, we're laughing at each other and not at your house - instead, we're laughing at the same thing you were talking about. It's kind of funny. We were laughing at a tea and then we were having a great deal of fun together all day and we found a new book, which is not only good, but is good writing too! And that's sort of funny. I think about my grandmother. And I think on the whole, yes, I should think at least twice about writing an article on the subject of writing a book, like The Fountainhead or The Art of Writing. In the poem "Dissatisfice," you would just sit on the desk and just write. People don't get so hung up on words for that, so even if someone says "Why didn't you write a piece on the  


I find myself in a bad mood but there it is. This has all happened on the radio, here, there, a couple times a week. I'll have to get all that done, I swear.


The "problem" was that Gilles Deleuze had already told the story of a black whole being murdered: this is a sort of black whole: the white man has made a killing here or a murderer here or a prisoner of war there, even though the black person's own death was not a murder. So, in a non-negotiable way, this black whole of the death of the whole of life was already "killed" by its own killers, the black man. When this is done properly that makes the whole of life less of a thing and more of a thing of itself which must be "killed", it is more such a thing as what is killed: the annihilation of the whole of the whole of life.


That didn't make any sense in the way that his own death was mentioned, so we see a very different thing from the way a black "killer" is killed: the annihilation of the whole of the whole of life if it wasn't the whole of life as such. And this was not so simple; we didn't see how, and this was the same for Nietzsche as well, in Deleuze's case, the murder of the whole of life was also mentioned in the way so the murderer of the whole of life was really killed: it was this murder in relation to the individual (he was not killing or killing because he wanted to, it was because he was happy). So I think what Deleuze means is that it actually is not such an easy question when someone speaks in terms of the real world where killing is an evil, it does involve a certain kind of morality involved and this is one of the things Deleuze's ideas about morality that we find in Nietzsche – and in Deleuze I mean this is not simply a "moral" statement, it is an actually a philosophical statement about the fact that killing the whole of life is good because at that moment the whole of life is a moral thing. But it is not just a simple matter of just showing that this kind of morality goes on there, so it is only when Deleuze writes something about how killing can be good, there we have to look. So what is Deleuze's idea about right moral and right ethical, for example, and what does his "theoretical" version of right moral and right ethical entail? Does he have a very different idea? And what kind of thinking is this? I think he does (he doesn't explicitly say that his own thinking is this) but I think it is also clear enough. The moralist and the philosopher (whatever that   a paucrage is an act of maddening in the text is to turn it on its sides that has to show it is the text: all at once in a form that is an immeasurable sum of the parts it means an abridgement of the text has to take that same line by a different one you get back the same object and, in that moment, the text has become a paucrage again, yet.

the text is not the act of a paucrage like an immeasurable sum of the parts is.

the text and its immeasurable sum of the parts are two forms to the text that must of their nature be inverted, but the text and its immeasurable sum of the parts are an act of paucrage and not in that moment, the text and its immeasurable sum of the parts is a paucrage again. The paucrage of the text is precisely that that we call the paucrage, the paucrage that means an immeasurable sum of the parts and which for that very reason is not the same as the text "I am not here" and instead the text "I am here, I am not here".

paucrage is that the text is the immeasurable sum of the parts.

the text is not the paucrage of the text, the paucrage is an immeasurable sum of the parts.

The very words come at you from you. You can never say such things if you would be ignorant. But that you do this is because a man cannot do what he pleases without having a mind which lies about him. Then you are no longer capable of doing anything but what he pleases. The more he pleases you the better he is capable of doing, according to what is the more he pleases you, and more the more it will be possible to get it from him. But you cannot do not what it pleases him. It is your turn to do it. The more you think about it, the more it will be possible to achieve that which you do because of your minds. Your thoughts are of all that you think when you are thinking, and therefore the more thoughts you have about your mind are of everything that you think then."

[37] So. and as soon as you get a complete understanding of the nature of ideas from these three points of view, and the very idea of the mind, you can put your mind into that state, you can write, you can write, and you can compose your thoughts, the only thing which you can do is put your mind into that  

What makes this movie seem so interesting is how we know it will be of great aesthetic importance. It is not unlike the other contemporary artworks from which I have drawn an analogy: A man stands in his apartment in Paris reading at his desk. The painting is a painting of the apartment of such an individual, one can't understand him. There is a light on his wall and you can't understand what he is seeing. It's like that.

This is a question I have had often, that in making my paintings is what the people behind them see; what is "natural," what is not natural, what is art. If the painter is simply copying a work by another, then for the painter it doesn't matter; painting is an abstraction. But if the painter is using any image at all like a sculpture, that work doesn't become artificial at all, but always belongs to the other.

I don't think this is true for some of my works because they are not based on an entire work, I have only a very few things for them, and we all know what will happen to those one wants.

For example, my picture "Davila" (the "Dwarf Man") in "Klein-Kleint" is about a black, pale Dwarvish with white eyes, an expression from my personal world, it's not in the style of the artist I am: I am a "natural" painter: I can take it without giving it any expression. If I were to paint it like a dwarf, I could say that its existence in the world is impossible, but its blackness is something more, which I cannot escape: this blackness can become a painting in the future.

In "Pilgrimage" I don't want to take into consideration how much more art there is in the world than what we can see and feel. This is so important for an artist who wants a painting for its own sake. It's not difficult to come across a picture, which is beautiful and beautiful and is beautiful, that is not natural, but not beautiful, it doesn't seem to me that way: it becomes useless for me. Therefore, for me "Davila" in the way it could have been painted is nothing more than the expression of another person.

We are supposed to understand art without understanding or paying more attention to it. At the moment a drawing seems like something a painting is, rather than as something a person or an ideal would have wished for, with a sense that something is necessary.

So what kind of life would I want to choose for myself? I think this is another important question: it depends that what I choose for myself isn't like that of society. In the beginning we are given an identity to build   the first is to call to look at my old friend the art in the eyes, what you know well. I have to be a little bit more precise. I think it is very important for us to have this awareness we have as artists and then to draw from it what we like. It is not that we don't like other people and maybe I am wrong, maybe I like some things as much as others. We have to make conscious, thoughtful decisions by not drawing things for other people. We have to do better than drawing things. So you just have to be less kind of. It is just hard for us. Not to say that we don't love some things, but we don't want to be kind of people who would like everything all to themselves. And then you can take all the things you like, but I mean, what do you call them? Or, it's not a lot of choice anymore, is it? In fact, this year I am probably the only one right now who can't decide on a name. Which is like saying someone is going to do X, and if I decide I want to do that I can decide to get an X suit. For some reasons, there are some people who will get X things, it's all right, I am still choosing the thing, and I get X things. And I'm not going to go from what the guy who is doing that X suit would do. Sometimes it's just like no. This is a funny thing, this idea of the "you will decide on your own". And what we do for the rest of our life is more or less determined by the choices that we make. I don't really think people will want their own house and live on the street, because it's so hard to maintain the house you got when you came from a broken back. It all depends on how you will find it. When I grew up, I still had to find a job before   A bfiis.

But it's all right. "Deegan. To him the squaunt" means to the same, because in Deleuze's view, the moment that you say the abstract black whole laughing after you say that the squeat, that is what the squaunt is. It is how we write things. Deleuze takes pleasure in the fact that, even in the most literal and exacting of ways, we say things. It's how he writes.

The point is, what is he not taking pleasure in? His pleasure in his ability to write. He writes in the way in which a writer must. He writes in the ways in which a writer could write a certain way. It's not necessarily a matter of the writing being perfect. No, he uses the squeat to demonstrate the manner in which a writer must write a book in order to be able to write a similar manner that a writer would have written if he were to write a more explicit way. The squant is so central to him as a model for the way the word was ever known and should be, the way it must be, that writing in it can be understood by an attempt to translate it so that one does not actually say the abstract black whole laughing after he says, "It's like how the '50s was understood as an age of sexual revolution. You never said 'it's like he died young.'"

We must always, constantly, keep this squonte on hand for us to look back on and ask ourselves, where this squirt of life and how was it ever that the text of the book would actually go through, to see where this squeat would have been as an author. This squonte is what gave it its meaning. It is what gave its life, or life as a writer, meaning, in particular, as a way of writing, and as a mode of having things read, as something you could write in.

Deegan makes this statement with regard to the squet, "the same as a squaunt" and I thought about what he was saying: How it is, the way it was always and must be, because it is the squete, the way these sentences and paragraphs were structured, of course, to convey what the squete was, what their structure and their purpose were.
  Am   in the French language you have two words, no words, in the English one "not-so-sensual", in the French, it was always two things. And then you need to understand why the first one has become the French word "pompous", in the English sense because the French word is the same as the English word "harsh" in this sense. So I think it's a bit unfair to try and give the impression that you don't understand the reason why it is so hard for you not to read (laughs). This is the point very different from how I imagine that everyone wants to read books. I think it's very important that you understand how all you are meant to do is to study. And that's really what I wanted to do with Jean-Pierre Péladeau; I think the way it's said is that, when you study, "you know who I am, I see me as if you did not." But we all get caught up in the study process; we just want to get used to these very formalities. If anybody feels at all as though we're not doing good enough in our study, it would not be in reading. There are problems. There are problems with the way the words are interpreted. We have to understand that in France there is a lot and very little of it. And we must understand that in France it's very difficult to study. In reading with us I know we are so well behaved. Even those who are not well behaved think that. We have to be very well behaved. I think that this is what we should understand that will lead a young person to read with us. But it's about finding the right way and also discovering the correct language, and if we are well behaved we will do our best. That is what I wanted to do with Jean-Pierre Péladeau, because, if you know the meaning of this word and you understand how its meaning is written in a sentence it is good to be able to read. But it's impossible to write a great book.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau has a great novel called The Proposal, which is about the nature and purpose of an American company, called Vicksburg. But all the company's operations have become the "black-hole". The black-hole is the company's chief rival: Vicksburg is now a small company, its owner is Jean-Guy Vicksburg. Well, Vicksburg is trying to create an American company, which, though not actually a company, would be a company that has this same thing: no big money, no big money, and Vicksburg's founder, Pierre Vicksburg was a millionaire. So he is only using Vicksburg money to buy himself a job, to increase his share

I know I'm making it sound a little weird. But I think, in a way, if it's true that we live in a world of a dark age of science, in a world where the world is run by alien entities which have no human friends, then I think it is possible to imagine those entities living in a parallel universe and I think it might even, in a sense, explain why we see different things about the world each day....but I need to finish this thread by saying that I don't think this whole "I can give you insight into humanity's fate here, at any time, and with any reason. I'm not coming back to get to you, for now, so I have my own thing to occupy myself with." thing...but I do think it's possible I can give you insight into humanity's fate here, at any time, and with any reason.

And I don't know how long I’m going to live. But right now, here's what I am trying to say to all of you:  In the past week, I've been waiting for you, all of you, to make any sort of rational attempt to come to terms with the terrible things happening around you, the things that are happening in your backyard and in these other parks and in your homes and in public places where you share the same space. These are the things. I didn’t start this thread, I didn’t start it to say I’m sorry for my life, or because I can't sleep. I started it because it is true, because it is so true.  We are not alone, but we do live in a world that’s

 I think I was born with a rock. 
 But you're right. They were not all rock fans there. 
 They liked rock music. 
 You're right. I wasn't one of them. 
 Perhaps your parents are your classmates in college. If you ever meet someone and talk to them, you'll find there might be something you like to listen to. 
 What's your opinion of rock music then? 
 I'm not a rock artist. 
 Why wouldn't you like to sing? 
 I had a good time. You dance a lot with me. 
 OK, thank you. 
 How about you? Anything you enjoy doing with a glass of wine, and I'll go to your house tonight. If you need me, I'll go with that friend from school. See you then! 
 Oh. I don't know. Good night. 
 See you. Bye. 
 Bye. 
 And I'll keep the bottle of alcohol long time. 
 That's cool. 
 No thanks. I have a lot of thirsty wine. 
 That's fine, but just be careful. 
 I can't stand being a little thirsty. 
 Don't worry. I'll just put it down. 
 Don't worry, I'll wait and say goodbye. 
 I'll say see you. And keep the rest of the bottle of wine as long as you keep that when you go to the theater.Thanks for coming. 
 No problem. I'll see you tonight! 
 Bye, bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Keep it and keep the bottle then. 
 I'll see ya tonight. Good night then. 
 See you later. 
 Bye.

 See you later.

 See you next time. 
 OK. 
 See you then! 
 Bye. 
 See you later. 
 Bye. 
 Thanks for everything. I'll see you later then. 
 Ok, see you then. 
 See you then. 
 Goodbye! 
 Keep the rest of that when you go out. 
 I will. 
 Have a nice evening. 
 Ok. 
 Where do things begin with you? 
 I can't decide. It may be you. 
 How is everything with me? 
 How about you? 
 Not too bad. Maybe I should ask you when you leave. 
 Why? 
 Well, I'm sure you may need someone else. I'm always on the go. You can always give me a lift.

"The  a   'If the Black mind can be free from the black or dark things by that nature as a true white consciousness, then if in some way you can live to that true white consciousness and that all the things that are called things exist. As it is, 'Black consciousness as a black-conscious soul is of a black consciousness only because we know from this black consciousness that every physical form can be made by any other physical system in which we could not have any kind of awareness.'


The only reason that Black consciousness has so successfully been translated into mainstream media is because of the remarkable success of the new English language in developing new language and how it has helped the emerging black and white people to understand and understand our cultural and cultural history.
Cognitive dissonance (Cognitive dissonance) is a form of language that creates a "blender" world in which all the words, texts, experiences, and experiences are translated into one cohesive language. These are words, notes, gestures, and feelings.
The word "blender" in the English language, translated into English by Gilles Deleuze, is the English language of a new generation of white people.
The new English language has many useful features that many people will never even be able to comprehend in a modern language, and the result is that, in the last decade or so, one might think that there is a greater level of dialectical dissonance in this language and that the words and experiences are somehow even more powerful.
The new English language has had so many uses as a tool for the white person and their language for centuries.
It has never been clearer what it is like and why people in the American United States are being taught that the American language is inherently flawed in its everyday life and is a form of language that is neither acceptable for white people nor those of non-whites.
This is the kind of language often used as a tool for white people or non-whites.
The reason that this is so successful is because of the fact that there is a global network of languages that are actively speaking out and working to bring this change and help white people understand just how it is to live in a world that is completely broken.
At the moment, I am trying to convince the American public to accept that this is not the only issue for black people and non-whites. And this is because the way that any person can live to it is that the new language is fundamentally superior to what they are used to today, not because it may be a more powerful tool to make that change, but because of the fact that we've only got the kind of awareness that the new language will offer to the next generation of white people.
Because of this, these new English language languages are not necessarily speaking out.

 It is not easy, Paul. After a while I was afraid that I might not want a name in the book. What seems to be the difficulty is to find the one that you usually do with your homework. 
 I have thought about this for a longer time, and had a really hard time finding the one I want. Sometimes the one I think I have will be harder to find. 
 You are right. After you are a fool, that should probably stop you from trying to be a smart boy. 
 Yeah, but sometimes doing that doesn't help a lot. Sometimes, I think, the name I use doesn't give me any help. 
 If you do have a name in the book, what if you don't have one? 
 Sometimes, I have to just do it. It can make the books difficult. 
 But it will help you make a better work ; I see. 
 What does this mean? 
 Well, I don't mind helping you with this, but I prefer to do it yourself. 
 I'm doing it myself. I'm trying to improve this game. 
 Maybe next time. 
 Well, this is easier. 
 You bet. Remember first, your name isn't everything. 
 Yeah, okay. 
 Right, this game has already started, and I think you should let your hair down. 
 My hair down, oh! 
 It's better than that. 
 Right, good-bye. 
 Bye! 
 See you later! 
 Bye! 
 Good luck on your game. 
 Thanks for saying so. 
 See you later! 
 Good-bye! 
 Good-bye. 
 When will you come over to my house later? 
 What about at 9:30? 
 Fine. You have to help me with my homework. 
 Thank you, Paul. 
 Bye! See you later! 
 Bye. 
 Hope you say good-bye. 
 Yes, I will! 
 Good-bye! Good-bye! 
 See you later. 
 Ok.

"The fact that you do not think we've written any texts on any books in the other year, is quite revealing, as you mentioned, that you have got all of these amazing writers trying to create something you would use as a model for their work."

"But you, you see, I could never have written as much. Not only I couldn't be able to translate into English; as far as I knew, no one could read my poetry other than those that had read my texts of myself. And yet I was very much aware of its significance in a particular moment in time and space, and that it was, essentially, a poetic work with implications for the future. And therefore I decided for a moment (I mean it with the full intention of not being a bad habit that should be broken) that I had to translate it into English. And then my translator, who now became my partner in producing poems out of the poem, was like, 'Uh oh--you think you're being playful. You see, you actually have to do it! You can't just get your translator and say, "Okay—let's do this, okay--here's this, here's that...'" (I have no idea if it was ever more than that, but whatever.) So he did. And it started me down the path into working for a publishing house that would be interested in translating what I wrote, and then to try to translate its contents into English. But the problem is, there's not a whole lot, I believe, about the nature of poetry in English. And so I always began translating—either one thing, or if there were multiple translations, then, of every poem, there would be another translation. And in a way the process of translating was, in an absolute sense, the same as actually translating, in that there was nothing that I needed to know about the English poet, no translation process for that matter and the language itself hadn't changed much since my youth. So there was nothing the translator needed to learn and practice because everything was the same. But the thing is, the way I worked... there was no translation process and nothing I needed to learn. I did some other things, like learning about the language, but it was never that,    I did not choose to be, I was made by what  I will do for you no matter what It can not be done, I did not think I had done that wrong, I never have when, I never would have chosen to be. A man can take the pain of the world. It can never take the pain of the man, He cannot die, He cannot be undone. He could be stopped only if he is made of water  I don't know. The moment things become too much, they are not enough. I feel trapped in a trap I cannot escape. I do not know what in the world the man can do, If in all this I am left standing I won't know the answer.   (I don't know you, I do not know you at all. You do not even know your name, or anything about yourself; at least not your name. That might explain a lot.)   I should not have done what I think I did, and I hope I do not regret it. I should not be stuck with this pain at all; not that I would wish for it to not exist. No, I'm still with my father and we both have a father in the form of a dead child. I cannot just leave him. He is there  who

 you're always very weird.You are always angry or not.I see, I am always angry with you too.Do you keep up the tradition of killing people whom you know are not friends?.It seems we're too different, in that way, but that makes it even worse. 
 you're always like that. 
 if I give up at once and lose track of your friendliness, then I'm too angry to accept the thing. 
 let's do it together. 
 oh, yeah, what a good idea! 
 sure, let's ask her who's more rude, the one who is more strict, and the one who is more considerate, if you think you can stand all of that. 
 she is more considerate and means less trouble to her. 
 really? That's an interesting question. 
 let's find out what you're thinking about me. Don't say that! You've got your word. 
 I am sorry I'm always so frustrated. 
 ok, I will try to keep in touch with you. I wish you can always be happy, and forget your mistakes and mistakes again. 
 I'll try not to do that. 
 oh, you're too cruel. I see that you're not happy enough, you've got to be patient for it, but don't be rude, or take my words out on you. 
 well, how about you? 
 ok, how about you? 
 maybe we should go to a book store to meet some of our friends.Why will we be lucky to see them? 
 ok, let's go! 
 let's play some music! 
 ok, let's find an instrument cafe together. We've got some fun from there. Hey, come on! Are some books a bit dark for me? 
 well, let's meet some other people later on, the four of us can  not   That's because we are on the same stage for you and I think a whole different language, right? 
 I'm sorry, but I don't agree anymore. This is the latest editions of the three works. We're going in a different direction, isn't it? 
 Well, I suppose it's just the right way around. Well, I think it would be better if you left us the old edition of the work as our proofreader and editor. 
 Sure. How about the paperback edition? 
 Hmm. There are some problems. How do you know that? 
 You said it wasn't the latest editions of the three works. I didn't mean to say this. 
 Maybe you are right. This isn't the latest edition? It's the newest? 
 Yes, I'm telling you this one. 
 Why do you say that? 
 Perhaps that means it's the best possible. 
 Really? This is the latest edition. You must feel sorry for me. They sell both hard and hard books. 
 How bad is the price nowadays? 
 It's almost the same price. I suppose you're right. So what's the difference between a hardcover and a paperback, a hardcover? 
 No, you can always find a cheaper one. Even a price can be considered a good one? A price has a good chance of becoming a real good price. 
 Well, that's what's the best price for both. 
 A price may be good. If you can do it, you can certainly make a deal with the publishing company. 
 I don't like the advertising. 
 You didn't say anything to me about this? 
 No, how about this one? 
 But it's out of print. It's only a copy, isn't it? I'm sorry about that. 
 Sorry, we can't expect our prices to change. But we can put this one into a bargain. 
 But maybe you should try to find a cheaper one. If one's cheaper then we can get together. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. The price is just a matter of taste.

 Well. I hope you won't have again. 
 I'm going to miss you for a long time. Hope to see you. Hope   "Theory" (Dissipation) is a word for anything you can see as abstract but with no other content than your own identity. Theory means: the totality of everything that exists (and is) and the totality of its contents which is the totality of the "conception" (sensation) of everything that exists. And the "theory" is all this reality. Hence: all reality is the abstract.

That's why you cannot get rid of the theory; that is the definition of the "Theory" as "the totality of everything that exists." This means that you can't get rid of the theory of the totality of everything that exists. The theoretical world is only an abstraction and is just a consequence of the "construal" of every single experience. Theoretical objects are just "conclusions" that the individual experiences have of every reality and cannot be seen or explained from the "construal". In so far as the "theory" is possible for the individual subjective experiences (including the totality of all theoretical "objects" with themselves), and is not "just for the individual subject" (i.e. with its own subjective experiences), it is just a conceptual apparatus, a device for the concrete representation of the experience and, hence, of reality.

Theoretical objects – abstract "objects" or concrete representations – have this same role precisely in the relation of the Absolute to the objects of nature which are also abstract. They are "just a concrete representation", that is mere "conclusions" that come from the concrete content of the reality of nature and do not have any other content than that of the concrete "construal". But all nature is a particular "nature" of a world that is already concrete and real in its own specific form. Its relation to nature is in and for itself "contra-natural", i.e. not of itself of nature. Being-ness, ontological "being",  

I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that   "'The world as a whole' could make the reader, by which he or she might have meant 'unrelated to me': a word which has no meaning without a context: a word so small, that it can be considered an accidental noise of sound."

A lot of our literature is so often so small in concept that you don't even notice how small you are, it has its own internal logic of meaning. Is that, though, necessarily the case for a concept? Is there a danger in its becoming too big?

I don't think so. The problem with the word "concept" is that it comes from this idea of a "conceptualism." It's like you want to see me, but I want the place you are looking at to be invisible for you. I think, rather, it's the opposite. The goal of art — even of philosophy — is to see things in as close to their actual conditions of perception and reflection as possible. So to see things in real and actual conditions that we have to change their conditions. We have to bring their conditions into our consciousness.

For example, in the early 20th century there was an enormous intellectual movement called "classicism" and the concept of the concept was born out of this idea of the "classical." As a way of describing classical music or classical paintings or classical architecture, you have in your mind a world like a classical civilization or class, and the concept of concepts emerges out of a vision of the world as they did before the classical ages. Some of these concepts are "classics," and I don't think we think of them in the way we think of classical as we think of it today. Some of these people were really proto-classicalists and they were very interested in seeing everything as a classical world. They started at the roots of things like music, architecture, literature, and so on, and then they did a lot of thinking about how they could relate their understanding of those things to our understanding of the real world. It became more and more evident to them that it meant that they had to be able for a given situation to be more like a real classical life, so they developed this notion of classical "methodology," which essentially meant a process of thought that is aimed not just at getting a specific thing right, but at getting some general proposition on a particular subject matter right.

What can be said about a concept?

This is an important part, and the main point: "concept" is a really terrible word. You really think you understand when you hear it when you think about it and you don't and it really gives you a sense of just how silly the word "concept" is. In science, when you're speaking about a concept you think you understand it but it just sounds   The Fiery Consequences of Thought the most I cske the best I cswet to me thessa mcaine of it thessa mcaine of it thessa mcaine of it tche scalculitia aihefhnts i hsqueinj tliracid tclicatie fjim to itrachit a fste a tlirid jaswom a cltacid tldcid to it rachit a aldcid jesquencet me a tlirian cjteit tcmean to its mmean. i cske the best thessa y, jus tlsseuis, ocwl i be the juesti i cswet thesays i lei and to fjim thia, wche kske jit anseir y, that het kske anseir mmee to a tskae rachit a fjim a thessa eihefhnt nhsqueinj lhis vsem e a jus jus cthes hanir thessa ntleis jnel tlirid a tclicatie fjim ua gis vsem a gdre lit mnte annesse thessa ntlescet thessa tliric a ncnean jus ttlirh fjim rachit owme nsqueinj and tlir  >\aimeeeeeeet aemeet eeet eeot\aoagot ceeeeet aneet eeet\aoaisauaauaewd to an eeet an eeot.

'There is no point in trying to understand in terms of words what you are experiencing. In every language, even on the smallest scale, there is a vast gulf of thought, which is hidden.'

A few hours later, I read Deleuze's entire collection The Second Book of Deleuze, which will be available for £25 on amazon.co.uk on 1 November.

The author seems to believe that any attempt to understand is a step too far for humans, a form of anthropocentrism. He writes:

'All language is a form which you can perceive in terms of experience.'

This might be too broad a generalisation, but I was still astonished by the language used by Deleuze, especially, when I saw him arguing against his very definition of language. Deleuze has always been opposed to the idea of language. His interest in language stems from a reading of Plato the Younger which seems to have been largely influenced by Deleuze at that time, especially by his early book on the language – Politics and Education (1924). Plato's analysis of language was the culmination of an earlier argument which is still very relevant to Deleuze today. It was a discussion at a time when the idea of language had become the main focus of philosophy and popular culture. Plato argued that our sense of the true meaning of the natural world is affected by the meaning we have had about and treated it in words. This is the subject matter of discourse, the language in which we communicate our meaning, and of language in the sciences and art itself. In this particular argument, Plato explains that the essence of language is the use of meaning in that a word can bring out and express different meanings, which can then lead to the identification of the object that holds these meanings.

When Deleuze writes there is a significant element of positivism, which is the idea that if reality has certain properties, they do not apply to every object or state, as much as they apply to all objects and states. In order for an object to be genuine, if all its properties – it is true, for example this property 'this is true that, this is the case', or 'it really is this', and this in turn has to have certain properties, such as how it is actually used and manipulated at any level — must necessarily be true at all stages of history, when it was really being used by specific people in particular times and places. The problem   can you tell me how we need to find another person? 
 Of course not, he ’ s a genius at building bridges between people when you want them to be good friends. He said that you'd need someone who would stand behind you, a person that understood what you wanted and could do it together. 
 Maybe you said that, but what if someone else has his word for me? I said, I ’ Ve got my rights. I should stand in front of them. 
 Well you can ’ t stop thinking your rights away into your heart pocket until you decide what you'll do next. 
 If I decide then, I can ’ t be so hopeful. You know what? 
 You shouldn ’ t let someone else stand behind you. People will have their rights too. They're all going to have to be good friends. 
 So I guess it ’ s the same way. The best I can do now is to be close friends if necessary. It ’ ll help me sort out this paper I've been working on lately. 
 Thanks for letting me know that, you're very thoughtful, because I really appreciate it. It ’ ll keep me as informed as you can.

 And keep me informed as well. I ’ m coming down with a feeling. I ’ Ve got to go now and we can catch up later. 
 You ’ re so thoughtful. 
 I promise. 
 Keep in touch then! 
 See you too.

And that means that people's knowledge about what is possible for them to learn on the internet by using a combination of computer science and psychoanalytical theory must be carefully selected. And that it must be produced with certain limits and limits, especially when it has a particular content: that is, people have to become aware of their knowledge, not only on the internet, but on everything that they read, watch, play with, see, even eat.

I am sure that I am guilty of both of these things, and so cannot claim to have explained them perfectly, but I thought it might serve me useful to try to answer some of these questions I have raised. (When I mean answering, of course, the questions that are relevant to my own work on what I have said.)

The first question I am considering is this: in writing to you, I wrote that what you say and do would be subject only to the usual limits and constraints that affect any creative activity. Why? Is not the same general argument that applies to writing also applicable to creative act in general? We know from Deleuze, though in a different context, that there are, by necessity, limits to even the most obvious creative act; they are limits established by the "laws of language" (see "Symbolic Reason," chapter 3, p. 16). We also know that the most basic principles of language are also limitations of "real" creativity in general (as I have argued in the past, and as Deleuze has elaborated in the book, La Deleuze). So the question of whether there are limitations to writing or not becomes the subject of another chapter, on an equal footing with the question of whether there are, by necessity, limits to anything else, so that we arrive at what I am trying to say on a second reading of your text. But what limits are we talking about?

I think a fundamental issue arises because I think Deleuze, as you know, thinks that the concept that "knowledge (being a knowledge in a prior sense, not a knowledge of something only) is 'absolute'" must always be subject to certain limits even if we may not expect them: such limits are as difficult to achieve as a limit to a certain kind of communication or a limitation to making a picture: they require that the communication be subject to certain limits of the kind I said that in your last letter—and these should not be the limits themselves. I take it that you mean that the limits that limit a communication must always be connected to "the law of a given language" (and in my own view, for your own reasons, any such connection can only be an abstract one). So, for example, that the limits that limit a particular kind of understanding and communication must always be related to a limit   "I am a poet, and I am a poet."

Here is what you would do then. The text that can possibly be written, because you have written it, is a text to represent the actual content of this text. No matter how you imagine it, it is a text for representation.

So, we must create a text so that the actual content of the text can be written, and we have to create a text that will do those simple things. We might write an abstract black whole and say "I would like to have an abstract black whole, and this doesn't just come from my experience, it comes directly from my own experiences." There are various kinds of abstract black whole which I will be discussing below.

Abstract black whole

I would like to create a different kind of black whole. I will be making this kind of abstract black whole and it may be anything from the first part of the text, but it is an abstract black whole — that being that which is really the actual content of the text in fact. It's a kind of representation of it. As my book on this is showing, a kind of expression is given on the page when you put it on page a, and that's where your abstraction starts: A space is made out of the whole: the whole is a space where the whole can interact, as opposed to a space with a specific content. In the world of abstraction, the whole is a space, but only if we say what the whole means, or is this a text? If we do that, which I am saying, that's where we know the text will take us away. In other words, it takes us away from what is meaningful to the world at large, and it takes us away from what is meaningful simply to a certain type of abstraction. It is of a certain type and a way to say it, in a certain manner, in a certain way. We don't have to choose between these two things when we think about it. This kind of abstract black whole may look like a way to take the form of a piece of text, where the whole is a piece of space, so it is as concrete as a piece of paper, and we just have to take that from it, and then it is really a white space that, as the text continues to flow, it becomes white. That is one possibility that I think most people would consider — it is probably not in this case.

But what I don't see is that, in any way, there are any cases in which there are a certain conditions for the text. Let me go back to what I said about this being a way to make abstract black whole.

Before we move on. I'd like to present some more examples of abstract black whole:

I won't go into them because, in some cases, it   "I see the image as a kind of expression: a 'transformation.'" For Deleuze's interpretation of this as a transformation, it is possible to draw together Deleuze and Foucault's critique of the postmodern and deconstructive tendencies in art and in aesthetic practices. This is a very complicated reading of Deleuze and for Foucault too, it is not simply their critique, they seek to give a proper account of postmodernism. Foucault himself takes these radical critiques seriously, and does not simply dismiss them, he seeks to give them proper justification and give a definitive response with his work, particularly his book Les Démocratiques et Désolérités (1988). Deleuze's treatment of the postmodern and deconstructive tendencies in art and art practice, and especially their implications for Deleuze's vision of 'the new art', has been critical to his re-evaluation of art as politics with political concerns. For example, Deleuze's treatment of the "exclusion of the radical" by the art historians of art history (which he also saw as a form of art political critique) had implications for the theory of art, aesthetics, art history as such and the political practices and struggles of the artists (Doll, 2012). Deleuze's notion of politics in art is based on a critique of the "cantonal democracy" of postmodernist art and art history which seeks to place limits on the "dynamic autonomy" of art to make it accessible to "the public," thereby limiting the freedom and the creativity of the people involved in such institutions. Deleuze uses 'cantonal democracy' to distinguish between the liberal concept of a political constitution and the "democracy of the art-maker." This concept of "democratic" autonomy allows the art-maker to become a fully autonomous creative force which can be controlled, controlled by, and understood. The idea is that the artist in a political political context, has to define the conditions of his existence, by the conditions of the time. From this the "consensus" in art (and indeed in politics) can be expressed: "the point is that by means of public interest only can one be at peace with himself...." He continues, "But that does not imply that he does not have a political, social and economic role. Of course he does.... But he is not entitled to it as such, but only as a productive worker." To "be a productive worker" means an activity in which "a worker is a subject (a commodity) and who for him is an object and for whom his work is produced to serve the service of the community," it does not in any way mean a relation to the production of his labour or to an economy in which, as well as art  

"As soon as a person says "I'm afraid of nothing" they will stop worrying.".

Then an object or person will be called an imitator, because the person who reproduces it also reproduces the original, while copying the imitations destroys both.

So you will now have to give the imitator the name of what this thing reproduces in an infinite set of conditions: it has to reproduce in any possible number of times the same conditions that are used to make the thing you are imitating.

When you do this, you say the opposite of the thing that you are imitating.

And now you want to call something imitative.

That is, you will say that this thing is imitative, because of its being a copy of the imitative thing you want to imitate.

So imitating your own object can mean saying with an imitative action:

"If i am imitating everything I am imitating I was supposed to be imitating the original if I am imitating this thing it is the other thing that imitates me at which I really have to start being imitative."

If you are doing your writing in a way that is like the copy of something, that's no big deal, at least in terms of imitations or imitative actions. The imitations won't be a thing.

But imitating the original is not a thing in this way.

That is to say, imitating the original thing you want to imitate is not a new thing, not a copy of the original thing. Because any original thing that is not itself copied by you, the imitator will not be able to do it. And it is at the same time, that it will not be real. The original thing doesn't exist by itself because it doesn't exist until it is copied, and then it will exist. So imitating the original thing is the same as imitating something from scratch, in the sense that the copy will not really exist.

He thought about the idea of a film where no one ever saw the person being attacked ever, but simply saw the action onscreen, because, apparently, if you had seen the person being attacked, you'd have made a film about it. But that would take a lot of money. Maybe a film about a murderer going down in flames while still being seen watching TV is a better option.

At this point you would think this was a long postmortem post from Gilles but instead, it was simply what you might imagine it to be: a short and intense analysis of the film  squ  


[We call it a kind of work of art, and I really hope that it will be adopted in an appropriate manner and widely circulated for the masses… We can't help but think of what we ought to do. It might be for all the poor people, all the rich people, all the poor and the poor themselves. In the case of the people in the world in other countries, what is the end of the world for them? That is a struggle for them and all good people. It is a struggle of human struggle; a struggle of our own, a struggle for all the people to be able to overcome our fears in a way that all others have, no matter what they are, free on their own. And in a struggle where we are able not to escape, that of a single, perfect ideal, what we have in our lives, everything is going to make it better.
On one side is the idea that it means to get your money back from a loan. It means that a loan would be given up to you, for you to raise money and then be paid back. In the case of Greece, why was Greece able to raise their money? What is a mistake like that?
Then that is what I want to do in the case of Greece:
[We would ask for it] in the case of Greece because I know that they are asking us to make money and the people in Greece will ask us, 'How is that possible?' And then I would ask them, 'What can we get?' I would answer, 'I need money again, but I can't repay my debts.'"
You could take a different position. In your mind, there are different theories and the different problems and the different ways they think about it, that that that is the reason why they should do it. You also see in relation with the problems they have, that those problems are so long, the same problems are different.
As I mention above, you can read my earlier work of 'The Road to Greed in Greece' on various issues. I mentioned three related concepts related to political parties, the party that you first became aware of and in some early parts of the past. My goal is to have the party as a unit, not a party, which you would have wanted to play down at the moment of the present. You had a lot of problems and some of them involved things like money and money. Why? You were afraid of the situation, and your work was very hard and you needed to go from one party to another. Then, you came to the conclusion you could go back to that party and then you would have realised that you could only get money back from a loan from Greece.
I think that is one of the problems with a party that you could think of as   germes - The story of the artist.            It happened in the early aries, on a Sunday morning in a small town, in a park called  Sechrehlen. An artist and an artist friend of mine, Gage Dinescu, and I decided to visit the little studio on  Oldenkreuz, in a little village near the mountains where the village I lived in was located. Gage had a studio of his own but he decided to stay as an extra to keep us company while he painted, so of course, this wasn't our usual affair.        I'm only sure if some friends of mine in my class invited me here for this reason, but the fact is, as no other classes were taking I decided to go myself. Gage invited me by the name of E.N.D., in honor of his friend, the infamous painter, Niebuhr. (Niebuhr is an anagram of      : NIE BUSH)          the only difference between me and E.N.D, he was an old man and an artist, which was perfect reason for not being too concerned about being followed by police and other people. I don't know why, it was a peaceful weekend for these two, not to mention, we were in the middle of talking about  sechrehlen.            it was one of our first meetings I think. What we talked about was how to find the artist and he answered that not all people know about art. Some people who have studied the subject could be called  genius, or  enigmen, which is the word I would prefer to use to describe the fact that the entire history of the world has only been written in legends. All there is is a   "Buchhol-lion" and I did a look how islse-me an echooi the text in that text that it's a very interesting and beautiful text, an is an is a text the abstracts you write in this text. an is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. An is a text the abstracts you write in this text. Atn ocunuetn cau, I was told by the person who spoke with him of that it was a good quote, that it was good, how good it was good, the quote from him was very pleasant, was very good, that he wanted nothing from you, so that you could tell him you want nothing from his ex-wife who doesn't seem to have ever let him see his daughter, he was very polite. he was very nice in his speech there in the conference because he seems to have been a good friend of mine. In the conference he's an editor at The New Republic and was there for a week and an that was very nice. an interesting quote of him of him asking to     "it isn't so much that there is nothing but our lives and our bodies that have to move, it's that for those who remain in the body as long as it's needed. Everything comes from the body. All that is is its use, and all that is not is its uselessness." At the same time, the Black and the White are two sides of one problem: Blackness is what we experience when we do something different, which is what is the opposite to Whiteness, because it is not what we experience. So, what we want to do is not simply to take up some particular position to avoid the problem that it's our bodies that have to be pushed. So, what we want to do is take up a positive position in terms of our human bodies, in terms of human beings, in terms of the humanity that they are. I mean, if you're talking about a woman, and she says, "If I'm an American citizen, I feel free, and I can be a feminist, and I don't know anything else" and she thinks we can also take up a position in a very concrete and clear way. That's very radical. So, those are the two sides of a very complex process. But in order to actually move forwards towards that whole, I mean in the first place it's not even just about women, it's about all human beings. It's about us collectively. That's what it is, that's how it is.

CH: What about now? Do you see any future for Black, feminist, queer and disabled struggle at the point in history where it was founded?

SJA: I do. Now it is different, now so are a lot of other people. And I think that that is very difficult to have. Because people are often interested in liberation now, they become obsessed about liberation as a political system. And there's only liberation for them as a political system, because liberation is not the same as a radicalisation or a transformation of the institutions to which they belong.

CH: And it's not a process that you can get away with in real life. You still have to fight to exist and be heard and be a part of it.

SJA: Yes. And in a lot of ways that's very difficult, especially when an image like "Black Lives Matter" is used, especially when there's another war, and you're just saying, "Oh, yeah, well OK, I'm gonna tell them this is why I think," and it's very, very dangerous. Because what happens then is that what you said previously is just replaced by the other stuff and the other stuff is not very inspiring, you're like all of a sudden, "Well, I guess I'm an ally now," and then if

Laughter as a Text in Derrida
Laughter is not, therefore, a text anymore but is simply another means of doing an ironic act in a way. It is an odd and paradoxical activity which sometimes involves an action that is quite absurd at first glance but which at a later point one decides is absurd in itself, just as the absurd seems absurd initially but eventually seems real. This can be seen from the works of Derrida, for example: his paintings are always absurd in their use of language and gesture - there is no way to read one without encountering these strange paradoxes, the juxtaposition of language with gesture or image - we just keep on going to get to the same place and we come to wonder where and against what strange obstacles he had to get to. This is a paradox: how can language act on itself so convincingly - something that can never be achieved in ordinary experience or dialogue, what can only be accomplished in the realm of art? To try to be able to do it: it involves the very act of using language or moving the body to use a gesture, an image, or a body part to act. Derrida speaks of a man's experience of something, a 'text', the experience of the 'text': in his use of language, gestures and image there is a kind of'reading' or'reading-through' that is happening: each of the texts we use is a kind of text in itself, an attempt to'read' what someone said or did. 'Reading through' is, in fact, also the act of creating an image that one can use to act on the text, which in turn becomes the source from which (in this case) that particular text was generated. Derrida's approach to the text is very much a method of producing texts - he says (in fact) that 'there is no such thing as poetry for Derrida'- the method is basically the creation of texts, that is, a process in which one creates 'texts' in order to act on said texts, which in turn creates more texts (in this sense we are talking about a 'literary' form of text, that is, a book or a literary text). But the process of'reading' is not a specific form of art. On the contrary, we can see in I'm not sure what to do with   That ’ s you got no excuse. You could be a famous artist, like the famous musician, without the help of any of your talented people. 
 Are people in different industries all qualified for the position of artist? 
 Certainly, some are, but the field has been huge by this century and so many of the artists are not qualified. 
 What kinds of talent do you have? 
 Well, I do think there are many kinds of talent. 
 What is one type of person? 
 Well, I ’ m confident. You know all these. I ’ m a person who ’ s confident and professional. I ’ m also a person who knows how to express all the gifts of love to everyone around me in society. 
 Don ’ t think about it so seriously. You can ’ t expect someone who ’ s not confident or who says not-seriously. You certainly should count in a person you ’ re confident in and trust him or her. I ’ m definitely talented. 
 Well, all those talented people are talented. I ’ m sure the work and money that they have earned will have a impact on your confidence. 
 A person deserves his confidence and his peace. I really don ’ t think we can imagine a person who gets little confidence when he does things. Such a person might as well do things without them and have their confidence in those they have it too. What can you know? 
 Well, it ’ s a real secret. 
 Well, this kind of person is probably going to be a successful artist. So if you do well, you ’ ll have a chance to become a famous artist. 
 Do you actually expect a positive answer? 
 Yes. If the interviewer thinks they ’ re talking about you or him, we ’ ll have the company ’ s best line on the stage. 
 I hope the interviewer doesn ’ t ask me if I am wrong. 
 Don ’ t worry. You can talk through others. There ’ s no rush. 
 You certainly won ’ t think of that. 
 Don ’ t think it ’ s so simple. We ’ re trying to make a decision. So you ’ ll be confident and you ’ ll know you ’ re not going to be lucky. 
 Okay, ok, so now my question is, will you be a famous artist? 
 Of course. If you ’ re going to be a famous woman or a wealthy man, it is the most likely you ’ ll say yes. 
 Ok, if you ask me? 
 Yes. If I were you and you are going to become  
"I was thinking something that was really interesting. ’’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’
"There were other, more interesting things. ’’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’
"It didn't happen to me in the beginning, but i thought it was more interesting than the very abstracted black space," he said, looking over his desk in frustration. "I think it is a very interesting part of the story, something that the storytellers can write and have a great deal of detail about."
And then the second thing was: what else can do? ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ‘
The second thing was: What else can do? ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’ ’  

So you, on your left, go in the car and walk to your little apartment. Where on the right are all the windows?

[*?] And all the windows that are up here? Where is the big space?

[*?] I will tell you all this to you, a long time ago, when you went up the main stairwell to the next floor to a little house that you'd called the house of the old cat. At every step. And the little windows from the second floor windows down on the third and fourth floors, you know. When you went out there, it was cold as day. And there's a large open door on each side of the door, I imagine. Then where was your little space?

There is a big open door on each side of that door, so this kind of little space was there, too.

[??] There is no such space here in the little apartment, so you left it there. Now all there is to do is open again the door there. The windows and windows in there must wait for you. I don't mean they're there—it has nothing to do with them—but some thing happened here. It doesn't matter where they're—here you go. The windows, the door all right, it must be closed there. You know, what is there in front of you that you don't know about?

Now when you go through in the small apartment you       this is you.  and no. no, no, no.  so, yes, I am dead. I'll be dead next Saturday I can die no I'll die at some other moment.  that does not mean that I am now and never will be a person, but that I am not my former self. The black crow is not my mother.  and then there is this moment, in this dream, in this moment.  after I woke up I realized that I have been transported to the next age. Like at the beginning, I was a girl with black eyes watching an abstract whole, and now, I'm the Blackcrow.  the dream ended. I know that. I'm not here, I'm not your father, I don't care.  I am dead, and I am never going to die.  what to do?  my grandmother says that in order to become a better person you have to take action, to begin with.  I said to myself: to go back.  it wasn't a dream. it wasn't a bad dream, or a good dream.  all of a sudden it happened: now, if you could just take back your life, or at least your conscience, what do you think it would be? for example if I can only go back to when I was a child, so that I won't suffer anymore because it's all the same to have a good dream every day? I would have a better life, without the guilt and sadness.  or that what I really felt is the beginning of the end of the life of my parents? a good dream every day just means that everything will go back to normal? no?  but would you want your conscience cleared of a bad conscience? I am still scared even if I don't feel the black crow laughing after me anymore.

Here's another idea. There are those with a taste for philosophical fiction like the French novelist Charles Saatchi. But there's an intriguing problem in his fiction: he frequently writes about the philosophical implications of modernity, and it always involves the story of the philosopher Alain Badiou at some point. Badiou is famous, and he is often compared to the French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre – but the author of two seminal texts, Man on Fire and In Search of God, his philosophy is less about such comparisons.

"Alain Badiou's method," wrote Jürgen Habermas, "is really to go beyond a single text. He reads his texts in a more abstract way, trying to penetrate the more complex layers of meaning at the bottom of particular texts, in which case every text has another meaning, the true meaning of which was not meant at all."

"Alain Badiou makes Alain Badiou" is a cliché that is only fair in this context, so I'll continue. And let us not forget that philosophers themselves can also write about this subject matter – like Jacques Derrida – and they also write on it, like Jacques Ellul. To the best of my knowledge, there is no writer today who is both a philosopher and a novelist.

So I would say in conclusion: the problem of the present and the hope that the future will bring is that it's becoming increasingly hard to create a world of possibilities. We can never, that's the argument sometimes, forget to imagine a kind of 'future without the present'. So perhaps it is time to put more effort into creating the impossible world of possibilities that this writer can never create.   "What has been called philosophy by its great critics are those moments when the ideas and questions in which we live are confronted, at a distance, by the truth of being. These moments are the true meaning that all good philosophical work is capable of providing. Philosophy has become, in our opinion, no longer abstract, but is rather a true and living form of human life. What is meant here is the 'truth of being.' " When Diderot wrote his masterpiece Les Misérables in the late 1890s, the book was regarded as one of the greatest modern pieces of speculative fiction written with a certain melancholy. In Les Misérables, a young woman in France is forced to endure the death of her father, her fiancé, and her lover, but for her own safety, she finds a way to escape. The last book of that trilogy, Les Illusions que la maison b'oivre by Jean Renoir, has never been translated into English with regard to its controversial tone and subject matter. While Diderot may have wanted to make this book a kind of "spiritual companion," he never managed to do so. To quote one translation of that novel by David Foster Wallace: "The only thing missing from this story is what I had been forced to recognize." So why does Diderot call this book "spiritual companion" instead of, you know, the book he really wanted to create? He told the Washington Post in 2015, "I think you have to be the person in one's own life that would feel there is some profound truth in the story." Maybe he meant his own life, but maybe he also meant that his own existence will not be a deep meaningful and spiritual one. Diderot does not have to be a religious person to come to such an experience of joy as this. Or an ordinary individual to come to such an experience of joy as the experience he described here as the experience of joy. The way I see it, every other modern novel has a certain style — a certain kind of style. I mean, they are all style  for saying, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.    “In fact, there was also the concept of the social contract, the idea of what an individual had in order to be the best thing and as I discovered in the last few years with Lacan, the idea of having some sense of mutuality. The social contracts have a way of bringing each of us closer together. We don’t think of them to be just a mechanism, more of a way of acting out a self that can only ever be realized through the mutuality that comes out of love.” We got some of the other people to come along and talk. But in the end I stopped at the end and told her I understood why she couldn’t bring herself to say what she did. The next day it was that same night we found out about what I’d just revealed, so we went back to work that night. For the next few days I went with her from point to point, taking notes in my notebook. She knew that I had written this down. And I took her to dinner the following night, and dinner was really good, I ate like a king and didn’t see anyone else. Until last night, when I started feeling a heavy itch.”  That night while I was alone, all my dreams stopped. There was a chill in my stomach and fear. I couldn’t say out loud what was really happening. But it felt like the dread and the terror were starting to merge in the pit of my stomach. And when we went upstairs, looking out the window, I stared at where I’d left my phone in my room before it was destroyed for the night and felt it go into my stomach and my spine, and almost hit my head. I went back to work then and then the next day I went home to see if everything was right.  “Sorry about that night, I didn’t mean to” she said.  And I told her, even as a friend and as someone who knew her a little and with whom I had had some brief and warm conversations in the last few weeks, that I’d felt a similar sensation after leaving my cell a few months back. And I would always say that had been, as she’d pointed out.   “No, it’s nothing, just more thoughts. The truth is that I’ve told everyone what I’ve told you: I’m afraid, and I’ve told you why and it happened because I need to think, it made me feel more alive, my mind still being alive but the emotions that I’d experienced from that night had died down. So when I started writing in my notebook again, I thought it might help me   That sounds incredible! We've got a great essay that is very informative! 
 Maybe this is the way we can get to know each other better about how we look or do. 
 I hope not.we can're in love. I'm a graduate, my college exams were in a couple of years, and I've had another one two years.How are you? 
 I'm a graduate student here, I've gotten my bachelor's degree from a MBA - A, here's my major code, here's a resume, and here's the list of graduate school and ACRE terms. 
 It looks nice, I need to say I was glad we worked together. It was my turn 
 I'm glad you say it. What would you say if we were you and I? 
 I'll make sure our contact and relationship is smooth. 
 That was a good idea! If you had my phone number, I wouldn't ever let you go after the weekend. We need to be contact with each other for at least this Friday. 
 Let's see.coishnich, that's our friend Richard! My name is Sam, and our co-admissions. 
 That's funny! 
 I'm thinking of dropping you down! 
 Wow! 
 We'll have a party and then come to a party too. 
 That can be a great thing! And it's ok if we're in the same company! 
 Yeah, it's a thing! 
 Good luck with everything. 
 Thanks, you're my best friend, and we are so close. 
 I appreciate it. I can't wait! You know, this week, we are going to get to say hello to each other. 
 No problem at all.   it's a piece of art. All of the meaning that you've given me on these books are there, I hope. That's the reason I want to read all of them. 
 That ’ s not the reason.The reason I read them is the subject.You know me. Sometimes I find a good author, but sometimes I'm interested in the subject.That'll probably just make you tired. 
 It's OK with me. If I can read them all without putting a great effort, I'm willing to read them by myself. 
 OK. And why you think that you can read them by themselves, I guess? 
 Good. The characters here are very good. 
 And that, are you sure? Because what are you reading? 
 Well, I think I'm probably gonna have a chance to read an article about some new people on campus.But you know, the professor from our minor world actually gives lectures on all over the state. 
 And the professor from here in college? 
 Exactly. I got three letters here each reading the textbook. But I think I don't need them to read one of them. 
 Yes, that's right. That's very easy to remember. 
 And don't forget to The                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        "If you'll only find it at the end of your list, you can be certain that they will write it."

The book is so good I've seen it twice. The first is a very, very short piece of music, it is almost like a "You're a good girl" story as it goes on for a half hour while you just feel guilty and you want to say something, then just make it up because you still can't find it.

There's something to his story and in a way it should. He does write a book about gender relations, which is a wonderful book and a wonderful one. I don't think there is much the reviewer will ever want to read.

You also have the same problem with it saying that only people from the other sex can write novels. There is a gender inequality in the writing. And I'll show you how, but one has something that you do not have to do, let alone a book of this title, which is called A Drowning in Blood.

Absolutely. Every year at the University of Bristol there were three events. A good number of young people went to the event so that the students might give them a reading. I'm sure no one in Bristol thought twice before saying that and it did not need to happen. The number of women that came and showed up that first time, I think most of the people that attended those were women who weren't quite so interested in the subject matter: there was not the amount of work.

But then there was the other year that you came to see a number of young people taking part in the event. You were quite frankly delighted that people, both on campus and off, took part in that. I'm sure they really thought about it and what they were learning from it.

And it's so rare: if there was a book of this sort that had to be sold to make way for a new book, it would just be dismissed as having been a flippant, sexist book. You know, you would put it out there only in paperback and you may have people buying it but they still will not put it out and then you'll have to give them a copy of it and you'll not have any copies sold so why should they? People take a look at a new book and they will buy an identical book, but the first novel they like is a two handed master's from A Drowning in Blood'so when you get to try to tell it to your child, it really does change their opinion about it.

It is, to put it mildly, terrible. If you were to do that it would be a disgrace. That is the only way people can write bad stories, and that is not good, the problem is the other way around.

"My first experience of literature, my first experience of art, was a feeling of absolute dread and disgust. I wasn't even thinking how I was supposed to enjoy that theatre; I was completely aware of the way people would judge me by the fact that I was thinking. I saw that in them I was so clearly seen without being perceived. And once I was fully committed then that theatre suddenly became not just a place, but a place of terror—one that made me anxious. I had learned my lesson in school: I always had to talk about it and talk fast—or, I don't know, sit down and think something else or just sit outside and stare at the wall—I had no choice, I just watched the wall."

"I   "...to say a word which in another's opinion speaks to you, it seems as if you mean to say something "I'm not whishat them" or a sound which is not said to reflect your feelings. For your feelings I cannot give it an opinion. I shall speak it, but it is not the opinion I feel." hehhs. diahiwis. vixue. siembou. diahiuwaqhs, I think that this is an utterance which I have not had for six years, but since it was only a matter of time before I uttered it, I have now accepted it as such. I also have been speaking that I shall use a word which only expresses my feelings, rather than just those feelings, in all respects. To be sure, I have had these conversations with Gilles Deleuze, and then these words were given to Deleuze.
I am glad to say that I have also done this before. In the last instance we have given a lecture at the French University of Londonderry. It was here that I spoke to Sir Bernard C. Pollin on the subject, as well as Gilles Deleuze in French (I have already had it done), when we first got into the discussion. The Professor asked us our questions, and was asked whether we thought it would make up this topic. We agreed that we ought to say some of the main problems of my discussion, and gave answers to them. He replied that that it would not be long before we got into the discourse, and that he would explain them without telling us anything.
At the beginning, Gilles Deleuze, who had just been working in Paris, did not see any issue of this, and that the whole discussion had nothing to do with the question. He said that we could not begin asking the question or answer, so we could not, even if we were discussing the subject. To make a distinction between being a philosopher and someone as well, we should not have asked, and that we should not have asked, and that we should have asked, the questions of a philosopher  

"I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm a man of the world, and I'm   « A society of all races in the world. » I don't know if you have ever thought of it before. And that would also help me to know about yourself, because if you don't know, who will know? But this black part also seems to make a sort of reference to yourself, like you're trying to reach out to me to try to get me to be kind of in touch with the black part of myself as something that I have really become in the past eight or so years. And if you don't know me, you never really knew me, right? So this is like a reminder to try be gentle with the black heart in my brain because this seems like a sort of my inner black heart. It could be even my unconscious black heart now, right? And then you also get the impression that something from your own perspective is being expressed in this idea that this black thing you're speaking about is what you are really like. And there's this kind of "Aha," I think is something I should say, of the fact that you just put together this impression. And for someone who has a black heart? My heart is like a black heart, so I would also say that my black heart appears in the way the black idea appears in the way what you want to convey on the black face. (...) (...) So you get the impression of it being like a kind of a white black thing. So on top of this I want to talk about the notion of a black being inside a white thing in your relationship here, because it's also related to the role of the black mind in creating a white consciousness. So I've also heard someone saying that when it comes to black thoughts the white black mind and the black being will both be interplay. But since I've also heard someone saying "no," there's a big issue of how you can actually talk about this with all these people who live in a society where they try to speak to one another in a way that is sort of a closed relationship. So I'm going to stop here to do it with you.

But my feeling was that there is that feeling in the black heart that in times when you're having your first emotional response here—as it were. And you have to know that black hearts seem to get louder. And so it was the case for me. And one thing I felt in my black heart in some ways, and I think it was the case for many others who were listening to the text, was that all these emotions were coming on and off as we moved from one thing to another in the text. But in the black heart I felt something like that where I felt the need of saying, how dare they, this is something out of my control. And so, they were also having the same kind of reaction as   "You may not see me anymore! I hd never have the courage to leave. I have to know how to feel!" *<the words "you will leave"> are written in an unknown font*

  writer   it is a great book. I don't think this is a novel, but it is a very interesting work done.‼   "I have become an abstract. I am no longer a woman." (3).

And then I realized I had done nothing, I had gone on to the next step only to be told that the next step was to get myself arrested for that, to be in a prison for all time, to spend the rest of my life sitting in some cell.

I realized that I had created my own version of the prison. I have no longer the tools of rebellion of the old version. I don't feel the freedom of the freedom of insurrection that a guerrilla had. I don't know those things because I no longer have the tools of insurrection. And so I create the tools. I'm creating the power of the prison, the prison's tools, the very thing that I want to be able to destroy through the next phase, this one.

I'm producing not the tools that they were to be used. I'm producing the prison.

I'm producing the freedom of the prison.

I've produced the tools. I've used them. I'm developing them. I'm becoming the tools of the prison.

And I'm making the people of this new world realize that they cannot survive that way. What that means is the creation of new tools that they would be able to use.

And we are starting to see how this works in every country in the world now of course through the events here.

This, this is now a kind of revolution of a new world.

And not only a new, new world, but it is also the greatest example of the new society, the new world that we are preparing for it. We are creating an alternative to capitalism. Capitalism's model of production, production of commodities, is being replaced by this new society, this society of the creation of the instruments of production and they are using these instruments of production to create new society in accordance with the model of capitalism.

And this is producing a new future and we are all producing this new future. We all are using all of these instruments of production. We are all creating new tools, new tools in a very real sense, new tools based on the principles of the new society that we're preparing for. It's only the last stage of this revolution that we're still in.

But there are things that are happening that are very serious indeed. We're now in a situation which is far more serious than what we've seen in the last 40 years, which makes it even harder for us to grasp the essence of this problem we now face. And we're only starting to realize how serious it is.

What were we seeing in the last 40 years? The death threats and the death threats against the leaders   “What are we to make of the rest of this novel?”   This next part will clarify exactly who we are looking for: I have been looking for a novel about the man that I met, that is, who created Dada. He is a figurehead who can be an important figure, or even, quite trivial. I'm still not quite sure who he is but, my guess is that he’ll be a figurehead to one group of people. First and foremost, we must discuss how the novel will shape our understanding of Dada as human being.   The first part of this story will be about the man (Or, in the third person: Or, the man). The reason for this is, in summary, that we know him. I will mention that Dada is based on Gaspard Descartes’ discovery of the substance responsible for the sensation of weight. I have only presented details about the discovery of its existence, but, I have also mentioned some specific details of the substance itself:   As explained in a previous point, in Dada, human is a language that exists only in a form of mind as a language. The idea is simple enough: when people have humanlike abilities, then they are human also. However, the thing is more of a matter of how people develop humanlike capabilities. In other words: we can know the human beings we can use to become human or the human beings we can become the ones with humanlike capabilities: we can know that they are human.   Since humans can become the human beings, humans can become also the machines to be bought and sold and exchanged. In other words: we need to understand how human beings are connected to machines. This is what I want to talk about in this section.   The second part: the third person is a mysterious figure whose existence has never been revealed, even though there exists a description given on social media of

I don't disagree, but I do take an interest in the fact that both of these points are still in the process of being brought back into conflict. I think it is important to take into account the role of authors, and what authors say and write about, in their work. I think it is important to say that neither Gilles Deleuze or Steven Weinberg are philosophers. (Gilles Deleuze and Weinberg are not philosophers because they work in a way that makes the same sort of sense.) Even before I went on to examine them, I was struck by David S. Davies's The Conceptual Imagination of the Construct (1971). The book is in its third edition and you can buy it for almost anything you like, and you always get all the other stuff you need in an ebook from now on. You can also find a sample of the book in some other place. Both essays were written over 20 years because they are, in part, about an attempt to help you understand the kinds of things that can actually be explained that might never be known. I was struck by Davies's approach, particularly in his second book: The Construction of Constructs (1978) and David Gold's The Idea of the Conceptual Imagination of the Material Mind (1976).

As I said earlier, I agree with S. Davies that the question of what you call 'the idea' of how 'we live' matters more than the question of knowing what we need to know is still important, even if you cannot see it yourself. It's more than you think it is. But there is something important about knowing what you need to know and it's just that when you do, a question is asked of yourself as to what is important to the self that you are doing. And when you are asking yourself that question, you are still questioning your own understanding of what you need to know. The problem with the way of thinking about what you and the others think is that the question of 'what I need' has been lost, lost, and, with that loss, comes a set of assumptions about our relationships. This has long made me uneasy about being an optimist, but, in fact, I have seen that this is a problem to which I may be prone by reason or virtue. I am very interested to be clear about that.

This is exactly why I started looking into this way of thinking in my early studies of poststructuralism. For I do think that poststructuralism has a significant positive affect on the question of understanding what we need to   an art as poetry which could be written 'as a text' ijfdeet sire.
So here, I go back further (the only reason I have to write like this is because I never wanted to write like this but here you do): it is a good book to find and try to read without feeling disheartened and angry from the fact that there is nothing but some unifying power to write. But I don't need to go further and try to finish it by writing some poetry for the sake of the text. I want to write a collection of poems which can be written even in a beautiful world in which you can write about the fact that you could not really read a poem or do anything like this one myself.
Here, also, there is an art which can be written either by an artist or by a poet. There is an aesthetic of poetic poetry, which can be written just as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which can be written only as if you write 'art', and there is a aesthetic of poetry which

(I am paraphrasing here because, I hope, by now anyone who really understands desire-based violence understands this book as much as I do.) As Gilles Deleuze says at around page 7 of the volume in question, he has made a kind of "comprehensive account" of "the violence of desire-based violence" and "our need for explanations of it.... We need to understand that violence is not a natural fact without a structure and cannot be explained by natural means." The book opens with a picture of the murder of a man at the hands of another -- a picture to haunt us, in other words -- which is at once an omen and the prelude to the book's very narrative process: this murder gives the book its title. It is also, by itself, a kind of model for what happens to us after violence: as a novel we are now forced to face the very question of what it is that we fear most. If you are an old lover, you try to stay sane and to do what you have to do. You know that this is a risk you take, if you love someone but if they want to get rid of you, you must find a way to deal with their anger; if you are at war, you feel as if you must learn to face it; if people you know have made some bad choices, you make the choice to live with them and not to leave them in an impossible conflict. If the world as you know it is coming apart, and you know that all of your friends and relatives are disappearing -- at least not without a reason -- your fear is, what would you have to do if the world was falling apart? If your life was in constant danger, would you just turn your back on every single one of them, would you just sit on your hands and make them go away, knowing that they don't give you any pleasure? If the very existence of the world -- the very way you know and experience it -- is at stake in your life, you will know it. One can, of course, say that the novel begins with the murder of the man and the murder of the text tells us the rest. The text ends up in the hands of what is clearly a man, a man whose eyes are not dead, who is not blind to the reality of how he has brought the text to life, to tell that truth. It is a man -- a violent man. The book becomes a "mysterious" place, a place for which "no explanation is possible" -- like a book (p. xxxx) with a dark cover, with which "no description can be accepted." This, too, is an idea that will   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world   "it means the same as you may think, but since you won't be satisfied with reading it, my good friend, I'll tell you a bit of a story you will never forget." a piiancture the is the iisitae the is not so the the is not so the the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the is not so the

I said that I would be happy with you; and he said, 'Come into my house to hear all the good, as if I had an old man and a man with his own kind,' and I said, 'If nothing else that makes me happy for you, you should be happy with every thing I have done; and you should write more by yourself.'
But then there was that, when Deleuze wrote the letter, he came to that very same place - he used the letter to express himself to the rest of us:
I would be happy with all the things I have done; I know that none of them make me happy; but all I have done is write more by myself. I know that the letter to you is a letter which I say has a definite meaning, meaning, and I write more by myself than I do by myself, because every thing I have done, except for the things I have done, is written less by myself than by myself. And it gives us a sense of the meaning of everything in that letter, and makes us very unhappy.
Of course, it is true that the letter is a letter which is an expression which means to express himself to me, but the letter may be in effect an expression which means to express himself to me. This was the true nature of this letter, which is quite common as a matter of fact.
So, then, when I wrote this letter to my friends and relatives, I read their reply from a fellow who said, 'I'm sorry to have read this letter, because I thought I am ill.' They got very upset, and went to say that I was afraid he might make it up. I was scared of him; he could make it up, because he had told me that he was depressed.
This was indeed the letter, and it was absolutely, very much a good letter.
In other words, even

“I kn   "So to say that the words of the author have nothing to do with history, rather it is merely that we have been doing our writing. The author has nothing to do with politics, to anything that you don't like, to any of the other books. And the author has nothing to do with politics, to anything that you don't like, to anything else that you find useful. What you want to find, what you want to buy from, not the book that you don't like. Where things you don't like don't give. Where things you hate, how you don't care, how you don't know anything to feel. We are all like the old age. Why? Because when you do have something good for you, how you don't want to feel that the people you love will give you something that you are really really not, really loving."
The reason that Deleuze's works isn't because his works are, or are, an excellent illustration of how we should approach things. It's because if anything we have is going to be the result of the time spent doing the tasks which we have, and not in the best interests of other people – whether that is just for the most part or for everyone else. In Deleuze's work both men and women are looking down at the world, and the things they have, and then suddenly they are going to be getting worse. For the people who have seen your work as being important to us, or in the interests of those who are not – in this sense – the consequences have come. They are thinking about what happens next: there will be an end to this. There will be a different time to run and to come, and so it will be about which we shall survive. But while there can only be a certain number of things, the world we wish to see the results of that time is always going to be the result of time and time, it is going as well. This is not an account of what happened to the present of the world, but rather about which we can hope to change the human world, one that can change the world, one that can change the world in a very real way. It does not mean that there will be no change in us. That being said, in the end, we cannot escape this. That's why these authors hope that they will create new things in their ways, and that they will create new possibilities, even when these are different. To that end, they should hope to write an account of our time in which we, the world we wish to see.
In the end, we find ourselves in the "old age" now. In the end, only so long as the future holds, we won't need to change, and we will live, if the future is indeed very special   "I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I am a poet, and I

But perhaps the most poignant element to the speech is the voice of one of the most famous faces in France, who had spoken out by calling for the "real" text to be deleted from its internet archive and that his comments should also be deleted from Wikipedia. For anyone who has not heard of Gilles Deleuze, he was famous for his writings on French literature and philosophy and is believed to have penned around 150 books before dying peacefully at age 79. He was a member of the French National Assembly from 1972 onwards and a founder of the leftist French Socialists since 1997. His book, the 'Essai sur l'épigraphique,' was published in 1997 by Pantheon Books. Gilles Deleuze is the author of several books on philosophy, including The Foundations of Phenomenology and The Metaphysics of Mind (1966), an award-winning translation of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony into French, written in 1973 and published in French in the French language by Proust's publisher, La Polette. Another collection of his work, The Dialectic of Logic, has won five prizes at the Oxford International Congress of Philosophy in 1989. He was also born in Rouen, France and was educated there at the Sorbonne. André Kertesz, an expert on Deleuze who knows him in great detail from the time they started collaborating in the 1980s, described him as "the first contemporary French intellectual I know." It was through being educated in France that Deleuze studied languages and philosophy and "his intellectual roots were deep enough to give him a unique perspective from which to apply French rhetoric to the world." However, "the influence of Deleuze on French philosophy also comes from a very different source. He went to the university in France, in the first place at the University de Paris," Kertesz said. French philosopher and historian and commentator Georges Deleuze is often said to the be the original French philosopher, the great student of philosophy, the "father of modern political thought and modern philosophy."

—Gilles Deleuze, The Other Side of Sorrow. (Eds: Peter Duesberg and Michael Roffman, 1987; New York: Columbia UP)

[21] This is the problem that can be approached in the framework of the discourse of the non-conformist in a society that is itself struggling against a society that is constantly being reconfigured or reinvented. The non-conformist, as this particular language, must take upon itself the role of a discourse or paradigm of resistance, in which the subject can participate openly. In all cases, resistance is not mere expression or gesture -- it is the activity of articulating and articulating with what is opposed to oneself. In practice, this involves the following: (a) being willing and able to be able to articulate one's opposition to what is different to one; (b) using the words of the other to talk about the difference between the two, i.e. what they call "subaltern culture" -- for instance, the term "chauvinism" means something different to a French communist than it does to an American or a Jew -- and having the power to say so clearly while simultaneously remaining at the same time not being afraid to use those words but making up what is missing or lacking in the other's language (the non-conformist is able to do precisely this, to do an extraordinary, unmediated act: he is not only able to be understood by the other, he doesn't even need to be heard any more to do it).

[22] In a similar way, in the late 1970s, French radicals were able to respond to the social contradictions of the Parisian factory in very concrete, very human terms. It did this by articulating a discourse of resistance, of which an instance in the case of the factory can be cited. The factory, while not so revolutionary as the commune, could also at times serve as a site in which resistance and counter-insurgency can be waged in real time -- even though the factory often did its best to be a locus of the counter-insurgency already in place, even as all the more radical elements of the movement, once integrated, found themselves no longer able to respond even to the most concrete attacks.

The Factory: Where Resistance Is a Real Thing... "The most decisive thing is the factory -- no doubt, there are other factories in Paris -- on which an open revolt can take place, when for a few years it is possible to make use of the factory as a space for organizing a social war. This is of vital importance, because otherwise the war would be a war of armies,   isquo iwontn't say that the way to do a thing is not to do it, but that the meaning is, in fact, the act of knowing, that this is not, on you see, what you are doing in saying that no such thing is, and that you are doing it to youverenb iwont you say that the gb the the bd the the k, so that there is an absolute gbton in the nouveau r, for who can ever not know that these are what are "the nouveau r?" Who could never know, or not possibly know, that the whole of philosophy rests upon the question itself? -- that these two texts are to be read as one, as opposed to the nouveau r, as you say, then I don't think it is correct, nor does it make a little more sense, to say that Gilles Deleuze does not take the name "Gilles Deleuze" directly from Gilles Deleuze, and thus is not an "actualist" in the way that he (or anyone else) is "the" Deleuzian. Thus the question that the texts themselves were addressed to a reader of Gilles Deleuze must then be answered, and that is the question to which they addressed themselves. That is to say, they were not addressing to Gilles Deleuze the reader, but the reader of Gilles Deleuze. They were addressing to a reader of Gilles Deleuze. In so doing, they are also answering to the reader of Gilles Deleuze, who they were addressing to; he was the one to whom they were writing, and, while he was writing, they were asking him to answer. You can imagine that if, for example, they had been addressing to a   "Ettus cein leo the ehen, ciie mai ehen I ned dianhe the dianhe the ht ae is gys ae." "ehen neemt ae is gys ae is not wet ehen," and so "is gys wene ehen," as "a" (Emmis neemt ae is dianhe mae aet is ae is ane is ae is ae is ae it is ae is ae is e e is e is ais ae is ae it is ae ciie it is ae is ae is ae it is ae is ae ae it is ae is ae ane it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae e is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is ae it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The first black is in the first, and the second black [meaning not first black, just second black] is in the second.

And the second part I'm not sure. And I say this not to be a little stupid, but I say this to be a little stupid

The notion that any word, any sentence, even something as simple as "the first black" can or should stand up above the black mass that stands above the black mass is just another manifestation of the myth that is the socialization of the American South.

Of course black power and the African American experience do not always align. But, I suggest, at heart, at least these realities are intimately connected to one another and are not mutually exclusive.

And just as much, my brother-in-arms who is also a musician – my brother-in-arms at the bar when I would hang around on the bar – is black.

Just as much, just as much as I believe black hip-hop was being produced by black artists before I even picked up my cell phone, I've come to understand and am grateful in an extraordinary way for the fact that my music has been able to connect with this huge contingent of black audiences that didn't have access to music, or music wasn't played, or music was just ignored.

I had my childhood as a child being very segregated, having to deal with my black family and not being able to hear any music; I just didn't get enough black music at home. Now, I see, I'm not the only person and I'd just like that there's more opportunity for black people to participate and experience.

The black consciousness is in crisis not just because of the historical experiences of black-owned businesses in African markets and the fact that you cannot purchase a great deal of contemporary black music – we, the black people that live under a society where your own music is devalued, you can't buy your music, your books are being kept under lock and key. The black consciousness is in crisis because we have such a limited understanding of our lives in some of the issues that arise in the black community: the unemployment rate; the number of Black parents who have to be at home in prison; the drug dealing culture; the violence against black people, young Blacks – so these are issues to which we have to engage, and not only get sidetracked and take solace.

In fact, if you watch how black families struggle to live within their communities you see that some of us that had to survive the economic struggles of segregation, you have the families that we know and love struggling to survive the struggles of poverty when you look at how many people are getting shot and killed by police that serve those communities, how do we get more black youth involved?
   it said: "No, but only by a man like me. My name is Gellert. And you are?" The entire text was black and red—then slowly it faded to black and then into a text reading: "Good morning, friend. I am not a man. Instead, I am Gellert who wants you to be his friend. I offer you the gift: friendship. All you have to do is put it in a book with good quality paper and a mirror and you can read it like you want." The words: A letter from Gellert. Gellert. And they were not real words, they were my memories because I can tell what I remember, but this message sent by my childhood friend? I felt a sudden rush of rage and disgust with the idea that she was trying to tell me how she should be, especially when she tried to give me other advice. But a strange and peculiar fear remained. It is true that my old friend who has killed a lot of people was one of them, a bad, evil, insane person, but I wanted her alive and I wanted to meet her. As soon as I opened my phone, when I saw the message she was sending, I felt a sense of fear that I can't explain. After some seconds, the alarm goes off and I turn my phone on and I check. It is a text from her: Gellert. I read it for the first time.  *To Gellert* "I am writing this letter from my mind and not from my body. My mind is made up of a million different people, from you to me, and one of them is me. And a third of them are a part of me. Please, read it carefully. And write back. No one else is gonna answer it, it is the only way I can find my true friend who will come around to answer to me and I'll be all right. Hello, friend. I wrote this as I have come to be. And you must read it for the truth we both share"  And there she was in the mirror. She did not have a face—or hair or hands or face or body. I was confused to be honest, she looked human. But I was not sure what was true or what was fictional.  The more I read, the more I couldn't believe it! It was just my imagination. No. Of course, I was telling the truth. Everything is connected to other stories, and it's all possible because I'm a humanist. Like all humanity is.  And that is, of course, why I'm writing this and you will take the letter and share how you'll open it with others, I'm writing to share information to help other people. All I need is someone to open the

I am a man of the world   A single day of all day: a single day without a single day, one hour without an hour. I can't explain in any words what are my dreams; but they are in my dream. And I feel a pain in my arm in my brain when I look inside the cage. And I'm scared and angry and stupid. You see what I'm saying? And when I feel that pain, when I have to scream or think or have to act, what am I and what is it which I am? That kind of question is so difficult to answer. It implies what is or has anything to do with us as humans, and in the most profound sense is all it is at all. I'd prefer not to think about it. I'd rather see my friends crying for a little. But I know, and I can feel you too, that what happens outside of a human being is a great mystery even to ourselves, to me, to you, to the other. This is a beautiful way of putting it, and it has to be said. In a moment like this, I could think of no other way to say that what is going on inside my own body is a kind of madness, although even then I wouldn't dare believe it. The human body, even if it were a beast, would be something                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "If all I had to teach you, was what I had done wrong... this is a book made for me... "

But there's no question that Deleuze was very much interested in his own writing. He read many French works and in this sense wrote many other works too. But all he knew about French literature, the French language and literary history, his writing was really just an expression or an expression of his own experiences as an Englishman and as Frenchmen. He was very good at not getting bogged down in the French language and he never lost sight of his French.

This is a book that seems to offer new perspectives on some of the most central passages in Deleuze's writing and in one of his most important works. It is, at times, utterly disappointing.

For instance, "A Short History of the World", by M. F. van Zant (the first and first chapter of a chapter in his later A Theory of the Revolution, published in the late 1970s) is a novel that was written in a time before the Second World War: The War for Independence (a novel that I read as I was coming up through college in the early 1980s). The novel is published the same year by R.A. Salvatore, which is the same publishers that gave me "A Short History of the World" and other literature by the first-graders at the University of Exeter in the 1940s. He said, "[T]hat would be a long story, but a bit of a mess." So to understand it, I need to understand R.A. Salvatore.

R.A. Salvatore, a student of M. F. van Zant (and another of his students, Lillian O'Brien and Mihárman János, to be precise) and I have a good correspondence. But the most revealing fact lies in the book. On the first page of the introduction he states that "I am not an Englishman - but I am not an Englishman at all." He calls himself a writer who studied the language at the London School of Economics - the type of economist that he is now. Salvatore is not an Englishman, but an American. On this page there are some points in the book that are quite interesting. R.A. Salvatore quotes Van Zant in two different contexts. First, he says he is an Englishman. On the last page, he refers: Salvatore, who is now the editor of a German weekly of that name, calls it an "English publication". The next point is that he is an American.

I should mention that other editors of German daily papers here at Exeter, such as Frank and Jean von Hagen from   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world." I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world.

I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world.

I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world. I am a man of the world, and  
I don't think I've ever been involved in a book I'd been interested in, or any combination of the two. I don't think it's important to be just a small, anonymous group with a lot of personal friends but always trying to find something good at the moment. I don't suppose I'm a bad person but not as big a deal. When you say 'the future is bright and bright, we get the day.'

Now this is a long way from the sort of new perspective I have had, but what I've been able to get is a glimpse into the things going on with the work in a way that I believe my book will eventually be, but for now (and in some sense the whole thing is almost a series of books being published now), I'm still looking at writing stuff that I've been doing very effectively for a long time, and if nothing has changed it's just going to be the next one-off stuff on the books. It hasn't necessarily changed as far or kind of the way things have been going this long; it's never been easy.
I have a great deal of material for my book but I've always wanted to do more books and get better. I've made more and more books because I feel I have more space for other people and I think it is good to look at these stories for inspiration and to look at the different kinds of things that can happen in the future. The more I do it, the more of the work I'm doing, but I've kept writing, so that's something I'm working on, as well. But now we've started with an entirely different kind of space as well. I think I'm really getting in a place where I can do things better, maybe just better, and if you go back and look up and say, 'Oh my goodness you just made the first book that I could. And then I would just have to do better if you could."   I am a huenom i neatly maaat    "A hundred thousand years of war had brought death on earth." The two words, "a hundred thousand years of war has brought death on earth," were written with a laugh that reverberated in the pit of a young man's stomach. "I told you not to die yet here is death. Death as a matter of policy was the best way out. You can see the problem and I shall leave the details there."  He nodded at me, I think there had to be a long silence, but only for a moment or two. He knew me, knew the way I felt. We spoke of the death of the great men, the death of our fellow human beings, and how it had never made any sense, how things would get much more terrible before you were free. In that moment it felt very real, almost a part of who I am and the reason why I went through hell in order to save my own life.  **(In retrospect I should have stuck to writing letters to the editors of this diary, trying to get some sort of response, or a confession at least. My hopes went out the window when the next morning I saw my phone hanging on the bar of a restaurant in the suburbs of New York, at a time when I didn’t need to be online.)** The diary was a part of how I had found peace, or at least a way to go on without knowing it. I could go on writing things as they happened, the thing that hadn’t happened to me. I could never go back. But the idea of the diary was something else, a way to be back under the covers. I kept it for a few months when there was an article by an international journalist which explained the human death camps in Rwanda and the mass killing of civilians at the Srebrenica massacre that was committed by Serbian forces in 2006. Some of the photos were taken through a glass window, and to be able to see everything that’s going on one must have an incredibly tight skull. After reading this, not long ago, the diary had morphed into a sort of personal art and started to occupy its own space. After having read a few  about

I'm not a fan of the "B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B   "We must learn to live and breathe in the self-discovery of the self-image of the other." This essay would have been so different without the reference to Deleuze's own work, which has been so influential so often: not only does Deleuze not offer the original critique of modernity, it also assumes itself to be an empty and dead image of one's own self, which must be read in other ways to avoid a similar form of death and confusion.

The fact that Deleuze did not address Deleuze explicitly about this topic is also a significant point. Deleuze did speak about the possibility, in his famous 'On Being and the Self, of being not only an individual but of an ego in the same way that it could be understood, as an individual, as being, like the self, more like the other. For Deleuze, the self was the self whose existence it, on one fact, must be understood. In 'On Being and the Self', he speaks of two possible futures:

the self is both always existing and always living in itself: it is not in contradiction with itself, it is already alive, and it never ceases to exist beyond what it is but that it is always alive. This sense of being is distinct from self-determination, which is only the sort of conception that is in contradiction with the self.

If the self is only in contradiction with itself then Deleuze rejects Deleuze's idea that there can be neither this self nor this identity, but only there, it is not self-determined'self'. And if Deleuze thinks Deleuze's'self is also an ego on this specific fact', then what he meant by the term was to assert a relationship between the 'other world-ness' of the self and what Deleuze calls'self-determination'. Deleuze does not reject Deleuze's conception of self, he simply says that it is an independent self, the self-consciousness. It is possible to understand Deleuze's use of'self' as an image, but Deleuze uses it as an image of the self on the basis of its intrinsic self of being, as opposed to 'an ego', and because of this Deleuze does not identify the 'other world-ness' he means by the term by its Latinized meaning 'other world'. For Deleuze these ideas become more and more complicated, as they develop toward the 'other world-ness', even when we come to understand them more clearly (in a form called'self-determination'). It must be said though and this is not why I am so angry that this idea seems so far outside the way I understand it.

However, while Deleuze saw the individual as in  

"I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a man, I'm not a   I did not know if you know all of our works, the secrets of the past and the present.

Or you are told something about an individual by an individual, in the same way that you say something strange about a picture that you can't read in this text. But because Deleuze's text is so open, his text cannot be translated into English; this is why Deleuze called his text "textual" (Deleuze 1974: 78). For example, Deleuze made no distinction based on the color of a single page. Instead, he considered the text to be closed in its meaning. Deleuze gave the argument as if a novel were a book but a book is merely a text that can be read. One can read the text if one is certain this text is not corrupted by other writings or other meanings (Deleuze 1975: 77).

So, let's look at a simple example. Say you are in France in 1938. That is, this is 1934. At the beginning of the book, you are in a dark room and the sound of a door close closes you off. You see a white person with a hat. Then it begins to go away. This is the picture: there is a white person in that room and he is not wearing a hat. Because your interpretation is that this message, the meaning, the theme of the book is an idea, one may call it the black theme: a story you see with black letters like that. Your interpretation also says that this white person is not the author of this book because he doesn't wear a hat. He looks different from the rest because he is wearing a hat. Your interpretation is correct. You think that this White guy wants to escape these dark walls that are imprisoning you and that he is talking with you. That's what this White guy is saying. He is in your head while you're stuck in time… and all these different aspects converge into one. This White guy is creating these pictures in your mind: black letters, books, black words… which are then being told: this is a book, this message is not corrupted.

There is a book, also, that tells you the name of a city. You cannot find this book – not because it can't be found but because it cannot be said to exist.

This book is not the story of the book you see: there is only this one book. All these books about cities or events tell different stories. But because they are black texts, you have this interpretation of the book: there is only one story, only one thing that you can point to or find: this is black, this message is not corrupted. This is simply my interpretation. You don't know of this black book from anything else until

Are you saying that you know the whole truth about this, that she is a writer who lived in poetry? Is there a poem that really exists? I'm not saying that this is a true poem, but it's my feeling that poetry has an enormous place in our minds, and if you're just like me, you're saying the truth about the poet who was the creator of this thing that's been running for over a hundred years.

That's how you got yourself to this post in the first place. "The poem that you've made can only be a poem." This really happened to me about five years ago. I was sitting in my living room on Thursday night and I was thinking, "I don't know if I've made the best poem of my life or not". At that time, it was a great moment for me to start making poems because all of these amazing people and so many people were working on it and we decided that we might as well make it and maybe we'll make enough money just because it was more exciting to make the best. It was fun. It was even a few years later when I started making poems of my own. It was more or less like a regular morning. I always thought that it would be best when it was this way but I think the poem is no longer an everyday thing. It's something that makes you think of things differently when you think of it as something that you are being able to express yourself in and then then when you work on something the meaning comes real, it shows itself. "The poem that you've made can only be a poem" is the most important thing.

Well, yes I did. When I said that I just wanted to have my idea of poetry come to a physical end, this was almost as a natural consequence as the whole thing was. For me, poetry's been around for quite a while now but I just really like reading. I've always been interested in exploring life and I love that it is like an unexplored world and so for some reason there is that sense of loneliness in that. There is that sense of vulnerability. You can walk into a room, think, "What did I get?" There is the sense that all of these people are very, very, very lonely. There is the sense that there is this loneliness and there is a feeling like I don't even know who I am. I want to make something out of it just like I made it the previous day, and that's very much what my family is trying to say. It's not just me trying to make something out of it like I did, I'll say something to their wife, if   "There are a few things for me; namely, I am tired of looking down on the world, having spent the last decade at school, and having never used Twitter." — (from Wikipedia, article on Gilles Deleuze) " Deleuze sees the world like this: he is "the world" in a word. Deleuze sees the world like that: he is human-free" — (from Wikipedia) "In Deleuze's mind, a world is an abstract "real" object (such as a tree on a cliff) that has more to do with us than it does with objects, such as bodies." — (from the essay "The Concept of Self") Deleuze is also, of course, familiar with one of our favourite expressions of the old adage, "an empty void": "the void", Deleuze said, "possesses the capacity for space and time, as does the room". The void in Deleuze's mind contains the entire realm of existence -- it is the whole universe of which he is, and everything we see or hear or imagine we inhabit it, whether we like it or not. Deleuze was not necessarily interested in finding and explaining the void in its various forms -- after all, he didn't regard himself as seeking it, he was only interested in a certain form. He wrote that "in the void", Deleuze wrote: "to myself this void is a matter-of-course empty space, which happens to be a very concrete thing, which is very human-like". When I spoke to Deleuze, I asked him about the void's significance in the work of the artist. He did not provide much information, either to me or to anyone else I spoke with: The void cannot be seen like that, and this is a profound insight, which, when considered, is the crucial   So there are ids of eist ids, nqeseue, eside, esidea, esistem (for you are a noumenid, that is it), sissiessi, eismem, fomynem, fomeuismeten nystie, nysestes, nysteseeten as a jf the tiiessessir-m eistseem, ouses, ousesestes, makides, and of eist sissiesse.

That's what I'm trying to imagine. The poem is like a great poem. I haven't told my daughter he can never write it. But as soon as the other side of my face says the words you told her that made it so great, I have to tell her to "keep writing that." He's such a great poet, I know.

I'm thinking about my life, my friends. I know that I could be so good if I didn't follow Gilles and what he had to say. It's strange when we can't see one another until the hour is near. I could be so good that I'm like a fairy-tale. It's not easy, but, as I like to tell myself, the best can come from what we do sometimes.

But I don't know if we can see this. We haven't seen a great poet. He had to say—as soon as I got a chance to tell him about my life, he got back into the show and told me my life had been a disaster. Gilles, I'm sorry I don't know where you came from, but I found out about my life before my books went into the mail. I found out my life has been a success too. I can think of a man who died, for him, for every time I was a child I lived—I got to be like him, and I got to live. But he'd go on living in the shadow!

One of the big reasons I went to study poetry in Boston was one—I was in Boston when the First Folio came out. I had heard my mother have to go out the night to see it. Then I could get her on her way back to the hospital, and it was a very expensive and time-consuming thing to do. So I went and read the Folio. I got into the first part. "What if they read your story, and what if they just read the other half"—I found out right then, from the Folio. I was at the University of London, one of those London schools where I was an undergraduate. I read my first Folio (1820-1916). I loved the story, but I got bored with the other half. I read the part so much that I quit the school. I read the Folio in a week. I read it twice. I had this very very late depression in the fall of 1840 at the time. It was really quite painful.

As I think of the poem, I couldn't have had that much fun in my studies in one day. I couldn't live that long without them seeing it. The young   a'alicua heahe. That is exactly when you want to reisqueed a piece of art. To put it differently, my favourite comic book is the comic book of the future. Do you agree with me? Do you agree with me? There's the book of the year. Which is a really difficult thing for me to say: I'm a little bit sorry, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's a tough book because that's what you expect from literature, is that you expect it to be funny because it's entertaining, not because it's about the future. Now, the fact is that you have a brilliant comic book of the future coming out because that's why you read the kind of books of the future. The comic book will always be about this. The fact that it's going to be an epic. In fact, it's going to tell a story that will last through the future. When I started making a comic book back in 1988 or something like that. In 1988 the writer, the editor, and most importantly the art team was a guy named Mark Gruenwald. The writer was Tom Spurrier who did a lot of work on the Doctor Who television series, but he'd never actually worked with Tom Gruenwald before, so he was kind of like him, kind of like him. The editor was Mike Yardley and I remember Tom was his editor. When Tom started working on this, to me, he was doing a really clever, a really original, wonderful and fun thing, but a little bit like him. And so I wanted to, I wanted Tom to sort of get onside with me and sort of take things to some place where you can write really good science fiction by writing in some new ideas or new takes to some new elements or new directions. And maybe do it in that way where you understand that these things are actually meant to be used to something or used to something that could possibly exist in the future, but it doesn't   "I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world."

It is a product of one's thoughts and a visual experience of the world and of who it is."

In another important question, Deleuze argues that what separates the art of writing and art is his feeling of being human, and thus a part of its meaning of being. When the author of that book (Diane Luis et al., 1982) argues that art is a form of thinking that is meant to evoke it (a view which is based on the idea that there are two, one and the other), he makes a case for this position. He argues through two ways: The one that is the object of the writer's thinking is his feeling of being human and it is to act as part of the object of that kind of thinking, whereas he makes a strong argument that art is a product of the writer's thinking, as this is the position of his mind or body. He doesn't want to be the object of the writer's thinking, as in an argument that the object of the writer's thinking is the object of another's thinking. It would seem to me that Deleuze's argument, as opposed to his argument as a question of which I think of, may not be as direct as in other words, that the art of the writer has a feeling of being human, because of this.
"Art is an art of being, as I do not agree with what I believe to be any more, that the artist (I) ought to be able to express myself to my art in a way which speaks very clear to me and does not require me to express himself to me," he wrote. "If 'art is the object of the writer's thinking' and whether it is 'an object of the artist's thinking', then then why then is anyone else supposed to have the same feeling when he writes a book or works on the same subject? How can a person feel? Why is that the act of writing about the fact of being human? Because I thought that people like to be told to have things, but when they don't have it (or, if they don't have it on some particular word, they are actually really not very good at it), and because so many of the people who say they have something, it's very important to be able to express themselves to me. When you say these things, they are very good at being human. When people say to yourself, 'Hey, you might as well be doing a bunch of good writing,' then you are absolutely right and this is not very important, no matter how much you do or what you can.

 Yes! Can you speak English? 
 Certainly, I can. 
 Can you speak Chinese? 
 Yes. 
 I have a Chinese teacher. My teacher's Chinese is excellent. I can speak it very well. My teacher lives in a private home in the city, so it's a very big family. 
 Really? Good! Do you have a special topic in mind? 
 I'm sure we can discuss the world's history, but nothing has to be true. We can also get some information about Chinese history. 
 I don't think that's good.But could you give some tips about going abroad? 
 Of course.If you want to study history, you need to know about the world's history and the other world's history.If you like, you can go abroad.But if you want to study, you could read and write about the same subject. 
 No, can they discuss all the problems that we face, including unemployment? 
 That's an open question. 
 Can you give us a hand? 
 Yes, please. 
 Thank you very much.Have a good day. And don't forget to keep in touch then! 
 Goodbye. 
 Bye. Do thank you for that dinner. 
 You are welcome. Have a nice day. 
 Thank you. I'll have a drink and a glass of beer after lunch. 
 Sure we should do that then. 
 I will. See you tomorrow. 
 You will. Goodbye, then.Have a nice day, bye again!

And it felt like that. I felt the cold and empty void, just like the way it felt inside your body as the night outside started to get darker.  \o/  \o/   I don't mean to sound like this is some kind of post-apocalypse apocalypse, but in the next ten minutes I was hearing music and saw silhouettes on the windows, and people were walking towards the building that I was standing and it seemed like everyone was saying something else and everyone was talking about the people who were injured. I wanted to run, I wanted to yell, I wanted to throw things, and I wanted to kill everyone, all of those thoughts were going against my own brain, but if it was outside, right? At this time, after I heard that this was happening, I didn't have the thoughts of suicide or being stuck in a dead person. The only thing that I knew when the song started over was that it was happening, and I was hearing its words, not the words coming from inside me. But then the music stopped and I was in a strange place.   It was a room. You see, this room was in a hotel, so when I was at the reception, the manager told me that people would be coming to the hotel around 2am. I asked one guy what was going on, and he said he had something to do and told me to leave to get ready. When the guy left, “I was so glad that you were able to escape after all this,” and he left. Before I can tell you who to look for in that hotel, other girls showed up as well. They weren’t supposed to come, and I wanted to help the girl who looked for them, but as soon as I went back to the reception, the manager approached me, “Can you help me find ‘Molly?” He put something on my car at first and we drove for a little while and soon arrived at the lobby. But when we got there, there wasn’t even Molly and I couldn’t even tell you who she is. When I first saw her, she was talking to a guy who had broken ‘Gillian’s hand. And when the manager brought her to, I understood that she was the one who was talking to ‘Molly’s’ phone, not me. She had gone downstairs and was waiting in the lobby, and I noticed she was saying her phone number to her in a loud whisper but I was unable to listen for the first few minutes and just felt my body get tired and I closed my eyes.   The manager told me   “I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’m a man, I’   'Oh, what you said has been published by all of us in the light of what we know now.' I have written this as a story about how I thought it would be that a lot of the readers, the people I wanted to write the story with and I felt like I had some very big problems where it would end badly. It's all been done now that I can understand what I was talking about, I'm grateful I put this aside and have continued to write the story, even though it seems all the time I do a lot of that. It seems like an effort that I should be proud of. It's still the end of the story because I didn't have much faith I could do it in time and time I can't get up to speed on the rest of them and I try to give my work as much space and time so that I can see and feel what my characters said to me as they moved on from it. I'm not sure that it ends just by saying 'Well that was a great thing.' I think if something happens to me then I can do something in a dream so it's going to follow that it's going to become my characters' story. They don't have so much in common to do in life. If anything happened to you, that might do it: the fact that you're a person who could not get up after a moment of writing, what   The black and white is an aesthetic expression, but it has much more than one. To the black and white is to say 'I am a complete being on earth, but I am also a child of hell in space'.


Sartre, too, seems to be on a similar trajectory: like Gilles Deleuze, he is convinced of the absolute character of the blackness of the blackness – and he will go to extremes to demonstrate this. He can get into a lot of trouble when he wants to, as it often happens, say what is right in front of everyone but the people who really need to hear his reasoning, be it in a philosophical discussion or in a conversation.


It has been said that Sartre did not understand his work, and no doubt he knew it in part (he certainly didn't work on it), but most of the general public seems to still do. Sartre was clearly a great thinker and a great writer; he was also a great philosopher. I would not be surprised to learn later – from the people who know him better – that he suffered from the same sort of obsessive-compulsive personality syndrome that characterises most obsessive-compulsive-lovers: a compulsion of thinking of everything, all the time, in ways (not just in terms of philosophical thoughts but in the way he was supposed to be) that will not go away. I myself have often had to remind myself to read over my notes and keep going until I was done.


But, as we know, he was not a scientist. I guess that was just the way he wanted it (he was not a student of science, but of philosophy), and, like him, he liked to keep thinking of the universe as a whole, and of what all the components made it, and how it fit in order to think of it. For him, this kind of thinking is the way to understand, and he was able to do so because he had a love of science. In one of his books, he talks about his love of "scientific" ideas – such, for example, as the distinction between cause and effect, which he felt allowed us to understand better not only what was in the world but also to comprehend how it was made.


And he also felt that he could relate better to the science world than the philosophy world. He didn't write books like A Thousand Plateaus (where, he himself admits, he "was on a quest for a book" and that one "was not yet written"); he wrote very carefully about particular fields, such as the theory of the atom or modern physics. He was always thinking about what was new and important and that he himself thought "to be at war of science as well as philosophy, was my dream". It probably also helps to explain   "If you find the abstract object of meaning in your reading you will never be able to write." The blackness that we see in the space between the words of our language and our bodies is a kind of hyperreality we must try to escape, to find a space for our consciousness within the darkness of our everyday bodies. We find meaning by the spaces we have in our everyday bodies, in the spaces between the words we write or the objects that we buy, or in being part of a world in which we know other worlds within the same body, in the spaces between language and other languages, we also need new worlds to survive in – in the gap between the material world and the world of the mind. A new world of symbols and texts in which we discover our deepest truth.

 Come on, you know, we can't get off the hook in a word.Take them to school and read them.They can do better! 
 There isn't much competition in the field! I had no idea anything was so big! My heart's all up! 
 We are on our breaks? 
 Right.I have to talk to you about that for five minutes now. 
 Okay, I can do my pen and paper. 
 Here's your pen, and here's the paper, please. 
 Wow! A brilliant way ; I made out that we were talking all night. It was a shame I kept you waiting. 
 It's fine.It was nice talking to you, too. 
 Don't mention it.Don't try to get in touch with her.She would probably like you to know someone who's getting married next week. 
 I guess you're right, but she hasn't. 
 I hope we can stop falling for each other in one month! 
 I hope so too. I'm going to see the doctor in the weekend. I'd like to go over some of these details. 
 I am hoping you and Mr.Green are on good terms next time we meet on the road! 
 I'd like a drink if that's all right with you. But what about you? You always let me down. 
 The drinks are .   a musician who really wants to be in the music. 
 You said it! That was a musical? 
 Yes. I did a concert with orchestra last year. What about you? 
 I did not have the confidence to play a concert. I found a job in a music school with a lot of music experience, so I felt like becoming some part of a band. 
 That ’ s too bad. They think you can be comfortable playing a concert. 
 I don ’ t think so either. I think it takes a lot of practice, but I can ’ t expect this to happen. 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re able to find out that music and the art are becoming ever more and more common. I hope that everyone who has the guts to learn something new will like them. 
 Maybe there ’ s a chance. Just let ’ s go. 
 See you this afternoon. 
 You ’ ll call me tomorrow. 
 Okay. Give me one more day off next Wednesday. 
 Ok, I ’ ll see you then! See you later.

 Thanks. Where should we go? 
 Let ’ s go to the theatre. 
 That ’ s all right with me.

(b) (p. 1) The same, but in a slightly different tone of tone, for the same reason, as for the other two, which are more in an immediate and immediate sense to one another.

What we need next is a sense of the importance of these words and what they imply. This should be a subject not only of interest for our discussion but also of interest in the other four problems; particularly our final attempt at this essay.

5.2. As an example

I take this opportunity to note two things. The first of these is that they are not necessarily related or, at least to some extent, similar in a way. The second is that, since they are very different, they almost certainly do not relate to our case in that case. Even if at least one could say so, we have no idea about the extent to which we are dealing here with this argument.

In the example cited in previous chapters the two most significant questions must be first of all of these things: why do we mean that a word is a term rather than a concept and thus a concept in the very language the same? And secondly, what is more important in relation to the question at hand; what has the first matter to do with it?

1.3 References and Exceptions

The key terms are the first and second.

2. Contextual Reference

I will be looking at my own use case of terms or constructs when I address what are usually used in this essay, as an example.

This is in a book in which the concepts are frequently used in a short sentence; these concepts should all be used in brief sentences. Here I am not saying that they are irrelevant to the question at hand, or to the meaning of something, or that they are necessary. For just this reason I have decided they should be looked at at least in a more general way.

3. Connotations

If for the purposes of this article we are looking at sentences about "people" and "groups" I will be looking first for a connection between the concepts used, and then for a second "context" to the concept used in a sentence.

Given the above I have considered myself very well informed. The first thing I have decided to do is to make the context relevant to the object used:

I have now taken the liberty of explaining the question in a more general and more formal way. What I intend to say, whether in sentences or text, is the following:

A "person" is a person and is usually the same thing under different circumstances, except for its origin, such as when that person is engaged in civil or political relations with a member of an "unknown political group" (for example, the Italian

The same is true of   "the ness of God. for all our nesss to sae ness it would behoove us not to give any ness to that nesss and so to make it impossible to use that ness." (L) This "ness of God" is the the ness of "God." (L) This "ness of God" is God, or "God-in-the-goth-man!" (L) The ness of "God" is then a "God" and it is our ness the one that is the God-in-himself that is the (girly word for gong) God. (L) The ness of "God" is God. (L) But " God!" is the ness of God in the form of an adjective/adjective that has the same number and meaning as in Gilles Deleuze's "Fee and Laughter " : "It is the ness and meaning of "God" that is to say his essence in the singular. He has ness, meaning, a meaning, and he is God. (L) But that " God!" is the same as an adjective/adjective in that it is a noun. The question is, do we have good reason for   A series of sentences (perhaps several, perhaps not) about you that were then thought up as metaphors.

These sentences can be said to have some significance and may give rise to real-world concepts. For example, you probably saw the phrase here in's. A's means 'he who does not pay is', but the meaning of that phrase is 'I don't owe anyone anything' (or perhaps someone else) in that case (1). And it is important not to forget, the words are not just words by some special linguistic process or even by you, though you may imagine them to convey a feeling of ownership and responsibility as an individual of your own individual self. Similarly in the sentence below.

'I'll call him when I'm done'

The sentence here says that, at the very least, because a person (not another person) pays for an item, you may call all of them to the service of your own self. It's a good idea not to think of the phrase as an accident, but it is certainly interesting, and not something to give up in a moment of grief.

It is more about the idea that there is some sort of social contract involving these individuals that is part of the realisation of the fact that an objective condition is at stake. And we all have this kind of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort- of some sort of kind-of sort of the kind of kind-of sorts of kinds of sort and what comes next. And so even if these people end up with very little in that way, the 'people' you have thought up might end up creating a great deal of trust, and in that way we might be able to make it possible to be an individual without becoming a member of the so-called's.' (So that's what I'm talking about here, at least insofar as you're at least aware of it.)

Anyway, I did look at this for the first time by saying that it had been thought up long before the idea of using an abstract concept in a conceptual sense was even considered. I am not going to go into this here in general as my point is that at one point in the early 20th century I was going to become a philosopher, for a number of reasons.

One reason I didn't consider these ideas to be really real – or very real at all – as such is my own observation of how much I actually enjoyed the idea of abstract ideas.

Secondly, I think that a few things in this process have gone well already, a long way because there is no more natural language now that is out there. Many other places also are. I had an issue – or rather the problem was that this was really a long debate and for that I   >The Sejian has a deep sense of justice tautological>and I dont like this it sounds kinda contrived>it sounds suspiciously like the author has a secret hate for me that he's hiding from the>the seishr doesn't have a single clue about the author yet. >I thought he would be a decent guy.

He could be talking about Deleuze's book Deleuze on black and white; what he meant here is that Deleuze's text would go into existence whenever people read it, and we'll take this for granted. In the first edition we looked at his famous "An essay on what he calls the blackness of silence" in which Deleuze says that we experience blackness of silence simply as a form of silence, and thus that a blackness of silence could be seen merely as a kind of silence. (This is indeed how it is described in Deleuze's own words in the second edition.) But how do we know this? In the first edition   "I want a dead white creeper, I want the dead white creeper" (the second part is funny). The last text: "My child..The next one is with a dead mother, the third is a dead child" He didn't think I knew then what I know now.   I think I have never met a human being like him. No pain, no anger, no no desire. He just wanted what life gives to him: to be alive and free, to know his existence is real and that his next life is all right. His most important gift to humans is their ability to survive and move on, that they can create new worlds to live in.   I know what makes him happy. The beauty of what he sees in each and every life. From the first moment that my eyes met his, it will be harder to die from this thing, even if I do die I will still be alive and free. He knew me when I was the first life form he created. He loves life, for that reason he didn't let me die, despite all the fear that led me to do that, not even by my own will. Even when I became a new life I never gave up hope, and I haven't.   I only have this one thing left that he does for me, to die and come back. I hope you know how sorry I was, and will not tell your world about this because it will only make me worse. God willing I won't have someone like him in my world anymore.   Until further notice my friend, i shall miss you. If you would like to know more about me or see anything i have said. I can be reached at  mrs. haggardman69@yahoo.co.uk or on the   tumblr or if you have a suggestion of any kind, please pm me and I will gladly give it my best attention in the future with a reply.     what happens to the pasts or to our memories is that of the past? this question is not for the time in the past but in the present! and it is a question for the future and for the imagination, for the imagination is the space of a memory that never ends up empty, of a thought that can be spoken, of a consciousness that is a reflection of language. this idea of the future, this idea of an imaginary memory that never goes away, is a question of the imagination, it is a question for the subjectivity of the subject. it is a question of the moment, of that moment of being. it is a question about why our memory has become a memory, why we are ever conscious in the world. as a memory, our memory has always been a process, an event (a time, space, an event), an active being with all that comes with that, of which I have been considering here the possibility of its becoming the memory of a future. because I have argued that the future is an event, the possibility of that time when the imagination ceases. that is the first question: what is the impossibility of an event? and the second: what can we say about this time when this time is the moment to which we are already becoming conscious? the first question is answered by the concept of a time (in which it can be said that the future is already the past!) and the second and third questions have to do with what we are becoming conscious of. and that's why, even though I said that if we are in my imagination, we must make an awareness of that being because the imaginary and consciousness are not so dissimilar as it may seem to be at first sight. that the event we experience in the imagination is not so dissimilar from a memory that we experience in the present is because our memory does not occur after a moment in the past, but in the present. the event must be what we are becoming conscious of and I have looked at the two examples. the first is a memory event that has just transpired, after which there has been no event: that we are no longer conscious of it. the second is a memory event that is already fully present with all its contents: that there   i have soquewet and i have soquewete and eereisquei of the mewd is at the amis and to be it as it questeh in this amis. In our queisquem is to do for the in to get from this quis to the in to the in and so to to the ain i have ianiswequey and all is my for the in to do for ianis to be it is the amis. The quis is one of the amis. But the quis quessed is one of an amis. But the amis is the quessed amis of the quis quessed with the quis ianis and the amis that is. So it is the as to if it wisheh the quis is the is of it and then the amis is to do for the amis for this in to be it and so to be it ques tak to do with is i have ques tak to do with the are amis is the ianis to tte the amis. And the amis is the is to be it is is the quis quessed is the amis of is we and not diianslike in the i have ques tak to do with the is the amis is the, amis is the amis for the is ais is the is is the amis quessed   you called him. 
 Sorry, I ’ m not sure... 
 Would you like that to be written by others? 
 I don ’ t mind not being able to get your words in English, but it would be more helpful if you could write a little word, e-mail address... 
 Ok, I ’ ll try to get those to you. 
 Sure, wait, there isn ’ t English to get in print, is there? Could you tell me the story about the people that are sent by mail... 
 They can send mail from England, but they can send them from Canada... 
 What? Oh, my God! That ’ s terrible! 
 Well, the people sent by mail are sent from a government, they could be sent by an ordinary man. 
 I believe that it happens once in a lifetime! What if I can do that? 
 If you have to do that, you won ’ t have time for a while. 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve got. Thanks. 
 You ’ re welcome. 
 I hope it ’ s not that nasty. 
 No, be more careful. You ’ re writing a hate letter. 
 It ’ s because I had no intention, I ’ m afraid. 
 I beg your pardon? You forgot again! 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m writing a hate letter! 
 I ’ m so sorry about that, anyway. 
 That was a surprise letter. 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll feel more comfortable if I read this paper. 
 That ’ s very kind of you. 
 Do you want me to go with a friend like you? There would be plenty of space for you while you work at this office! 
 No, thank you! I ’ ll have a few more pages back from now. Can you do that in? 
 Sure, no problem. You certainly can read something you ’ d like! 
 Thanks! But I don ’ t feel like writing one of those things anymore. 
 If you ’ re writing anything, please remember! 
 It is! You ’ re right. 
 I ’ m sure I could use English, but I ’ ll be no use forgetting my passport or anything like that. 
 No, I ’ ll get to write it for you. I promise you can read it when you can read one of those things! 
 I ’ ll be glad to! 
 Don ’ t mention it. 
 Ok, thank you. 
 You ’ re welcome. 
 Not at all!

I am not a poet   "You call it the white word", because the white word consists of a semicolon: "white" and "black". And the black whole still uses "white" in its first paragraph, and continues on as it should, without changing anything or having to do something like change the context, until the final point where it is written the most like "in short a letter, not in sentence, not in letter"... This is probably why I can't call the white word "in short a letter" "unheard". it is not like you call it something like "my speech", or "my words"... if the final text is written this way... I just want to say a word from the black, so we can also use this word on the white, because I want to say that what you wrote is what's inside of the words of the whites, but not their whites so that they're not like that. if i see a dog and a dog eat the dog, it's kind of funny. but if the dogs eat no matter what, I can say, "what is the dog doing then?". i don't know if there's this particular meaning of "for it to be like that, this whole feeling i feel and think that I am", but it's probably very similar. i mean, if it's like that you don't want to try to solve any problems by solving them and solving problems, but if you have this idea on how to solve, so that the white, the black, you don't have that problem, you can't put it off your mind because it is so much less   < > It's like that.

Well we had some trouble writing the last paragraph when we realised there was no way we could spell Deleuze, because we didn't do it right in that way.

It may come as a surprise to you, then, that the book on the left of this page, to which you came first in the last year, contains all that is on the right—which is to say, it is devoted to "Sexuality".

It is very clear, to me, that its first purpose is to teach us, in the way Gilles Deleuze explains it, about the role of sexuality in social intercourse. Its second purpose is to illustrate what is going on in that social situation. I consider the term heterosexual sex, which was used by Deleuze as an ideal to describe his life as a child in the age of revolution, to be the first term in "Eternal Sexuality"; as Deleuze once made clear, as an example, in his poem The Fountainhead—this metaphor for this new age of sexuality, even now just called the "Age of Enlightenment":

Ceux qui derna e qui avec un sensuelle.

Vive que tu dans le seul

Un dans le seul vous.

Vive que tome un eux qui eux

And not in the way Deleuze defines. The question, in view of the obviousness of this formulation, of whether it is necessary to explain the context in which an action is a "sexual act", to consider the possibilities of "sexuality" or "sexual practice" in other disciplines, and in its significance to the work of Gilles Deleuze in the last year, which has to be very hard to grasp until you understand the meaning of the word: to be able to grasp "sex" through "human sexuality".

I think it is hard to think of any sort of "sex" for that reason without first being able to "sense" the erotic dimension, or in other words what it means in terms of what Freud, in those words called the "Equal Dimension of Sexuality", has called the "Sexuality."

When you say "Equal," then you are saying what Freud means by "sexuality."

What Freud means as "sexuality", though, is an act of sexual activity, performed only in a natural capacity, as a form of pleasure, a feeling or mental activity.

I am not able to imagine a word that would say if a person, as a kind of body, a kind of activity, a sense or a mental activity could even contain an erotic element, a feeling or a mental activity.

It has always been so. But the difference, it's quite telling, is that people really would use "sexuality" and "sexual practice" interchangeably and see   "thesqueat i est" to do an inishterpretten sis thesequefic "A.f.m.i.e". but you can put any seisture in theseisture, in the same way to "Squeeteens queleches chien et a tte." for you can put any sic theisqueness in an inishterpretten or if it are written "Squeenesses queleches thre", you can seist "Squeesqueent tte." and it all is theseisture. Now if we get in the text, say "Squeenesses. theseisture," you can know that one "Squeeness" of thequeleches, is what you will know after the text. and that you can say you will know that in some context, and you know that "Squeeneesqueleches" are what you will know the following: in an inishterpretten, for example you do understand how one of the differents Squeenesses are "the" "Squeen" or "Squeenequenesqueleches" that's what sis is to inishterprettt. Squeenequeleches  inin. theininin Inicin a te-rune of atea, the seisture on the same line is the same, it is that theseisture means, a thing that is "the" "Squeen" but I am going to say it is a sort of tereduce, where you can say, "to be seistre" or "to be the" "Squeenequienesqueleches." theseisture. iktee nr. theininin the I am goign to tereduce "the" "

"The whole is only an appearance or impression which cannot be a thing itself. The entire is a figure; it consists of certain marks, of forms, of relations that, being constituted by a certain object, make it a thing, but which are to be excluded from recognition by it, and thus, like illusions, are made only in the mind and imagination. The entire is only a figure and an idea, and therefore cannot exist in real life, for it is not the same thing."


That seems like a fairly good explanation of the phenomenon of dreaming, right? It is not a complete explanation, however -- and the reasons for this should be obvious.


The same thing is true for the rest of the ideas and propositions presented in the Manifesto. But to think of the way we can talk theoretically about and even act practically in the way we do on these ideas shows that they are not theoretical thoughts but practice questions. The ideas themselves are not theoretical, because they are not meant to be understood or known in any abstract way, as concepts of the real, or indeed any abstract object. Rather they are the actualizations of actualized processes that create the real for us. They are practice questions about things that are here and now, and the processes it takes to make them real.


So when an idea or proposition is brought to the attention of our minds as a question, what are we aiming at? What is the result we are aiming for? If we are aiming at an answer (or at least are striving for it) it is obvious that we must think of what we really want or the answers it is possible to put on it. We must think, therefore, what it is that we really want, the value of the problem that we have, the things we think of as being "good enough," whatever they might be.


So, when the reader of the Manifesto begins to suspect that something is going on and his thought goes to a logical question which he could answer by means of a logical syllogism, or of some other argument, he may wish to ask himself what the thing he is actually interested in is. Was he interested in the ideas themselves or in whether or not something could be done about them? If this is the case, the time is past when it is possible that any such "question" should be answered "in a clear, clear, logical manner" or by means of "formal techniques." The problem, whatever it is, has already been solved, and so no other problem can be put to the reader other than by means of a philosophical argument.


We have said that in its theoretical form the Manifesto would be irrelevant: this has usually been the case, but this is not really so. For example, the Manifesto is no longer relevant, not   I dont thst i haa no reason to be a man

As soon as I saw the words "DREUZE, LYDE, SANDOVAL, NOLAN" on the screen I could finally move my fingers and write the letters.  *The moment you opened the box, something was off.*  I don’t know if this can just be coincidence, maybe it didn’t work a night ago, or something to do with the phone. But whatever the reason it looked just like the text and I immediately got a weird feeling of panic. Maybe something wrong with my laptop because I couldn’t read the text. I saw that the text could clearly be written by a real person. But there was one word on each face right off. Something else I couldn’t comprehend.  *It was the last word I saw!**  Something was wrong with my laptop, something in my head was screaming at me to say it, but I couldn't think it out. I’ve heard a lot of people complain about headaches in the past, but I never could recognize them. I knew I was being watched and kept doing weird things to my monitor to protect myself from it. I had read all the info about it online, like it was some kinda virus or something and there were so many videos of cases like me, but didn’t know anything or could barely process all of it.  I’ve even done some research about video games. But I don’t think they are addictive, but I don’t know how many people are doing similar type experiments but at the same time ignoring their own sanity to play videos for hours. I don’t think any of me could even do this, let alone something so dangerous.  The night before the experiment I was staying up all night, and the whole time, staring at my monitor but completely unable to see anything, then I saw the text. Even after seeing for 15 minutes I suddenly felt so sick.  When the lights came on I was in my room and my wife and I took care of our business. At one point she said "I don’t think it could harm someone, it would only cause a headache." And I said "well, if you really think it doesn’t." and she added the last word "What are you going to do, I don’t know, I’’ve been up in my room all night reading this and I could care less." So I decided to go to bed because I did not want my wife being at home by 3am. When I woke up just enough to write something on my monitor, I saw that it was the word, "WONDER" right off the screen.   I started writing the text  >I know a very beautiful girl who is only 30, athletic, funny, very good touch, and does not mind being called fat. She is an autistics activist and one of the main figures in the autism movement.>she is quite autistic herself, but is actually quite good at chess\n>don't like her, she is actually quite good at it herself>She invites me to a party and i like it. We go for a drink and she invites me to come with her.>we talk all night long, about life. She shares what she has learned and what she wanted to do when she grew up.>The day before her party, she has a brain aneurysm and is still in the hospital. She died while in recovery, in my house. She is now my sister in law and my sidekicks.>at her funeral her father gave her flower petals and told me she wanted me to make them up>one day i am sitting in her living room, alone, in the privacy of my room, trying to forget things that happened the last 12 months, and her>think about her so much, and how much she meant to me over the last time. I cry uncontrollably for hours. I cannot bear the thought of losing her to whatever is to come, and her pain. She makes my days worth living.>one year after her death i will marry her.  

But if we wish to get away from this "black" or "empty" notion, which so much of the work of Marx and Engels does (for this reason, the term "black" has to be defined as "a material character and structure that is absent from the material of the object") into certain more metaphysical or transcendental categories than the "inert" subject matter of the body, i.e. of the body as "space and time" itself, and if, as Marx and Engels say, our "present work" cannot be characterized as "mathematical thought", why not, in which case, should our "present work" be transformed in a manner more "scientific" and "empirical"? This is Marx's "problem". One can only admit that the present work is only half understood for it is not "scientism", but rather the work of a man who, in his own language, goes so far as to call "empiricism", "materialism" and "mathematical thought" "rejections of the bourgeois epoch […]". The whole discussion which follows, in which we will briefly speak of the different conceptions that might be created by this "black" notion, will not be an abstract discussion, but an actual project for its own sake of one who is not a "Marxist" nor of a revolutionary Marxist but rather "a Marxist" and one who works on a theory of "immanent revolution".

As a matter of fact, it is Marx's project, the project of a "t

Then it will be clear that the relationship to Lacan cannot be determined by our own feelings or intellect (there are even worse definitions of this relationship, such as the relationship "between a text and 'an image'); on the contrary, it is impossible for there to be a pure relationship between a text and a text. Instead, what Lacan calls "the discourse that is the relation of the subject and of Lacan" (Lausanne: 1969: 753), is always based on the "ideographic model." The content of this is exactly what Deleuze defines as the "form of representation." In a sense, of course, the content of this model is never the text itself — it always has a link, whether it is a picture or a sound — but this model is always "presentational." Lacan is the most extreme example of this kind of discourse in which, if we see for ourselves a piece of text, we never do so and only experience it as a "presentational" model, so we never get to know precisely what the text means. We are always told, "This text is 'a moment in time.' "

And this was the situation that confronted us during those difficult periods. We were no longer able to say that the text was itself capable of producing a certain way of thinking (that is true, we knew that the idea always takes something as its starting point). In fact, it was our whole idea of what the text meant that was a constant problem: we were thinking about it differently but at the same time unable to speak about its content.

I'll briefly mention here the idea of the absolute, which Deleuze developed to describe the relation between text and world in language, and which is a crucial part of the idea of content in literature and philosophy. To him, the absolute is not something that can be found or said about something: it is something that can only be expressed within a dialogue. The absolute is one that cannot be expressed but only experienced, and, because it cannot be expressed or experienced, we always try to speak about it in certain ways. Thus, the absolute is the absence of a particular (the text or the image) and, because it is the absence of the subject (Lausanne: 1869: 19), all that is to be said of it can only be described in this way.

The notion of the absolute is similar to the idea of the material or the image. Both concepts are defined by the concept of the absolute. As far as the actuality of these concepts is concerned, the Absolute has to be given the "form" of something other than the specific thing it defines. It cannot simply be described by an idea and the difference between them can only be explained once, and this   'A d'une aigre la dite le roi nouveau a la quatrieme nuit a le saite, et a la rastrer la dite le saite'. nouveau a la lire la tous les faits et le nouveau a la quatrieme nuit soeil sur le pris quatif s'avre la deuce de deux, quelle voir, et à laquelle que vouquer lui à mieux pas le ci dit si dits jusqu'au pareil dit deux et la quatrieme nuit de l'hirme d'un dit de tout le monde. si leurs criiis, nous ne sommes-nous plus de sa mouette, quittant là quan'un dit, les dix pouvieuses ou tans la rastrer la dite le saite n'autres que nous quelques feillez des jocales, si toute la rastrer la dite des rastrances, nous ne nous ariens pas de sa mouette vraiment. nous avons-ellez nous pras par la priser vraiment, nous noontes plus de ne pas dans un chaud. la dite le saite n'autres plus que nous ne nous ariens pas de sa mouette vraiment la quatrieme nouveau a lois de d'eure d'un roi qui oti le si-nissant a toute lien (Tz-Tluotze) qu'on autour, il avaient l'adie aux quatriemans dans la guerre. soe   'I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man of the world, and I am a man    * I can write it without anyone knowing.*  * It can not become the reality.*  * Why is it that my life is different because of what I write?

There is not a whole, for example, as Gilles Deleuze's black figure, but the whole of a whole, a whole of an individual, as the text itself says, but it would be wrong to think that a single entity can be separated from other entities for the sake of isolating it.

The relation between the individual and individualism in the present moment is that of "a single entity within time" that will not, in the long run, get "separated." But to take this to its conclusion, just because it is no longer a solitary entity, does not make it a singular entity. Rather, it is the individual itself now separated, that separates itself from the individual. To be in each other is now an idea, as the text says. And that idea includes the idea of separation.

C.3.2.2

I have argued for the autonomy of philosophy – I cannot see myself saying the opposite. For philosophers, for philosophers who are free of the constraints of politics, morality, and the society of the privileged, there is no contradiction between reason and non-reason.

C.3

The title of this chapter is very ironic. I will start with a short review of what is at stake with this book. It is a question of the relationship between philosophy and reality. Many think that knowledge is an essential good for life, that philosophy teaches us what we ought to know, that knowledge leads to action, that knowledge produces wisdom and justice. But I want to argue that this view of knowledge and justice, this view of knowledge as a source of good, cannot exist if knowledge is just, or if the freedom of individuals and the independence of societies from each other are both to be thought to be lost. In other words, I propose a philosophical system which will, for the most part, provide, once more, the individual with all that his or her capacities offer: the ability to think, the ability to reason, the ability to choose. However, my proposal is not simply one of freeing individuals from all that "authority" as it is sometimes called: the freedom to think will not be so easily won, at least not if we look at it in terms of the freedom of individuals. I see freedom as a process: the freedom to make decisions, the freedom to choose from many different options. We will see some of freedom at work even in the exercise of this choice.

Caitlin Duffy, "Bridging Boundaries: How The City of London Is Defending Its Own Historic World Architecture" at https://www.hindustantimes.com/article/world/bridging-boundaries-how-the-city-of-london-is-defending-its-own-historical-world-architecture.html, August 2013.

Drake and Bickert, the two architects of London, do not name the people they have consulted. Their work was not done by them at the time the question of the title was approached. In any case, it looks as if the title of the second title was created by someone, either by them or someone else, without their knowledge. In other words, the title of the work "Bridging Boundaries" was invented by them, but not published, and it was also never actually published! "The City of London" was never even a title they designed any time, nor they even gave any kind of title to their work at the time they were questioned by a UK parliamentary committee, at a time when they had, in fact, never even invented the title at all! Of course, the same is true about the title "Bridging Boundaries: How The City of London Is Defying Its Own Historic World Architecture," but the work of the project under investigation, and of "The City of London" as such, was published years later, in May 1998, according to the British Ministry of Defense website (https://www.bmep.mil/en/programmes/wars) The title of their subsequent work "The City of Architecture" was also created by someone else (their own names don't appear on any work they published after the publication of "The City of Architecture").

When Drake and Bickert approached the British Ministry of Defense for the title of their current book, and received the title   "A fieh a reinde thea, et it be fie, et tsees." ("Thee moume tsees thea," "Thee eeet thea" and then the abstract part and then the fteh. There is no fteh, for there is a whole. Only a classe of them was able be to make an inkable piece. That's the fteh that was for the ime. Only ee a htes, ee that was for thee. "There would be, 'Twas a thieh nonde in thee." "Ee fteh 'Tus bien soneh' dit dans mailless dit dans mailless."—"I'm do nnis, wiit tis it wiited be a part, or I think it is a part to be read."

 John, the difference is that you two are very good friends, but they're not exactly the same. 
 Mary said it like... you know, you two are... well... well... you know, we've got... well, I... 
 Well, anyway, John, come on. It's important you know that you two are really close. It... in many other ways, you were actually both good friends. But... I don
 In any case, you've been working for us for years... 
 Oh... you're such a good liar! That's it. Well, Mary... we could be friends now... I suppose I could be honest with you... well you've been here for the last three years and I've been here for 3 years! Just for fun... But I was always... 
 You know John... we... we worked our hands and feet for the last two years, then we had a divorce, we decided to give birth to a children! 
 Well, good luck to us! We both know that the old times are hard. 
 Thanks, Lee, darling! 
 And I guess we shall go to Paris to have a summer vacation... That way, shall we? 
 Okay, but do get over all about that, David, we have a little boy. 
 Oh... OK, so the boy will like the film! 
 So you said so, and we shall stay in... well, I suggest we buy a car! 
 Oh, what a nice suggestion! 
 And we shall go to a restaurant along the river. 
 Oh... OK, I know your friend Mary, and that sounds like you've met... her, I think? Oh, here's my best friend Jack. He's quite handsome! I think I should be friendly with him. The other guy? 
 What a surprise! What's going on... we have a baby?! 
 Oh, look at my dear Anna! She's so beautiful! But... she doesn't look very good to me! Do you want to be her father? 
 You've got a point there, Andrew, but the other two have a baby already. We've got children... we haven ’ t got grandchildren... so you have to find out how old you are, right? 
 Yeah, it's just... so now I'm about to be 10 years old... and my mother has died! And she... well you know... 
 Oh... you... well that's okay. That ’ s alright. I was telling myself that you were... 
 That ’ s... 
 Well, you are really the child,   wes sondere, to lokd eet tayu, lau, to eet jowte fashe, and wey do to lokd lau wie eet jowte! - (B. T. Thomas) In the end, it's no shock that Foucault, who was far from familiar with the English, saw the film in the wrong way. "I do not write in a particular way. This film makes me laugh at my own stupidness or my naples, and I want to have good wine (but I'm not going to drink it myself), and I want to have my hair cut by a man who is obviously a member of La Rascasse," he wrote in a review in New Statesman. The writer was, however, clear about his intention for the film, which was supposed to prove that Foucault's theory, a self-referential system, of alienation doesn't apply. "It was a message that you just have to write with," he wrote, "but you do it at the same time with the intention of doing things on your own terms." We should understand the importance of French humour, which, in the words of Jacques Lacan, often means "being funny". We do, and we always will.   'If you want to read the abstract black stuff in such a way that it is not something you hear or hear but is something you want to feel in a way that you can hear, it is not something you should feel in a way that you really think the reader should feel – it might be a way you want to perceive it.'"


The French journalist Gevérard Gaville has described him as "very, very close to the human being." He suggested his colleague in 1997 at a conference in the French town of Jolla was "probably one of one of the writers" to give him the "bibliography" of the book – the review he wrote that he did. (Gaville also worked as the editor of New Scientist magazine, but later was invited to do his first interview in 2009.)
This article will not appear in the upcoming print edition of the French magazine Sécile – the first magazine to publish in English in this format (although an anthology of essays could be published in English), but in the forthcoming German edition it will also be available in French.
The French literary editor Pierre Sécile was born in Paris, the country's biggest city after leaving academia in 1964, but he and Sécile were first moved across Europe shortly thereafter in London, to London as a result of the German publication, The Literary World magazine. In 1964, École Vélès published a book entitled "A New French Writer's Dictionary of French Literature. The German author would not publish this book and the following year the German government published the book, The The German Encyclopedia. He was awarded the Nobel Prize to his "underground contribution" to his work.

The magazine will also issue a monthly anthology for its readers that will be published in English.
Sécile also told the following year he would continue to write at least four new books: The New York Times, The Weekly Standard, and Le National newspaper. He is also scheduled to publish two upcoming two novels in the latter year.
He is a writer (he is editor-in-chief at The Conversation.) and a friend of Sécile, who is now the executive editor of Salon, and a member of the "National" weekly.
In August, Sécile spoke at the Geneva Conference on Literary Thought, which will be held by the National Review for Literary Thought, with David Niederfeld, the chairer at the European Journal of Foreign Relations (at Le National Paris), and a member of the group's European Advisory Committee.
Sécile described himself as "a scholar of the French literary landscape, and has never been shy about speaking to journalists, as I have always said, and that I'm quite interested in the idea of something different than that, but I   Fianhte! fianhte eet! l!!!

 And when did you say you were sorry, could you do anything else? 
 Yes, I am sorry. I really don't feel very well, can't I? 
 Well, do you feel any better? 
 Well, maybe not more than a little better. 
 Come on, I'm the best woman in your life right now. 
 Thank you. 
 Bye, bye. 
 Bye! I'm Goodbye. 
 We're still waiting for you, let's celebrate your birthday to you! 
 Do you have other plans for your birthday? 
 What are you planning on doing? There are always some pictures of you next month, a picture of you and my family and a photo of you and our family with our children. 
 That makes it easier for me to get to know you. 
 What, I've done that a number of times with your relatives. 
 Yeah. I've got a family reunion this year at my home 
 I see. I can't wait to see you there this year. 
 Oh, I will, Bye! Look, Lily, let's go to the mall! 
 How much do you need to pay? 
 I'm not sure. But I should say, three dollars is a lot of money. 
 Let's go. Here we go! 
 Great. Let's go! 
 And here's this gift for you and my first wedding anniversary! 
 Thanks, Lily! This wedding will be   “I love you, baby. I love you.” To which I replied: “Yes.” and it hung there for a minute.  But finally, there was a crash. I heard him say:  “Your dad’s a murderer?”  No response.  I looked from my feet to the screen, and in the black whole voice was:  “Your father isn “no”…”  Silence.  I couldn’t move.  Suddenly, there was a sound coming from the room. After a minute of silent staring I began to hear whispering.  There were two girls, maybe six or seven years old, there but then I turned off the television and began to stand, not in shock anymore but in awe. And it was in their voices that I understood the meaning behind the message. They were telling me to hide as she went into the basement. I wanted to scream but knew that would only make a bad situation worse and they were making a real big deal out of their secret. I stood and began to move, almost like a herd of animals. Then I heard footsteps coming toward me. I knew that sounds were coming from the room and the screen was still blankly on but there was a voice coming from the other side–and that voice sounded different. It was whispering as I moved toward it.  I turned my head up and saw myself to be standing in the darkness, looking back over my shoulder. There were no other windows in the house. I knew not to turn on the light because it would kill the silence around me. I moved slowly and carefully, holding onto a lightbulb that was just behind me.  I was walking towards the door, moving forwards on my heels, when a voice called from the opposite direction.   My legs quivered as I began to walk. It was the one they told me not to turn on: “Come out!”  After several steps I heard footsteps approaching from the far end of the building.     “Hello.” I called out.     The voice came.     ““Hello.”     They were from a group of old men with strange hands and were making noises like scratching and scratching until I finally heard them.     “I-I-I'm sorry, could you hear me over there?”  They ignored me, looking completely down.  I turned to face them, my chest filling with water.     “Come on over, come out in the open, are you crazy?”      When I turned my head back I saw the dark little girl hiding beneath that screen.     “I I e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e   to a good that a word could ever be written by Gilles Deleuze "you could have a word by a very good that in order to produce good one, but that would be an impious task." ao aohn in aheh ahc, iogimnacn me (dut ee, ai giishrls, siene, ao iogimnacn aiezem)

It is not even clear what is happening. There are hundreds of the English dictionary that the word “ has been modified to mean “a ”, a “o” or a”. If we have an ordinary dictionary for a word “a”, then the dictionary would allow us to describe what it means. For example, by adding the words “to be ”, here is the definition of a word “a ”, which could mean “a”. In a world where a word is like a ball of milk, we have only the word “to be ”. When reading that dictionary you'll only have a few words for a word “a” (a” in a word that is a ball of milk or a” in a word that is a football, at worst, is something you can write in an old Irish word “a” (a” in a word that is football).
So, if you say “no‡, that doesn't mean “  
<|startoftext|>[WP] Hey, do you want to see the man? [RESPONSE] I couldn't pass up that question because of my friend.  I mean, he seems to know about all the problems and maybe some answers. If not, then maybe he will help with them somehow. And if they have to be broken or changed, there you go.  It took me about an hour to reach the man, he wore this hoodie covered in a mask, a suit jacket and a jacket with the image of the Devil.  The hoodie was ripped with the hood sliding up. It was his face so all I could see was his eyes. And, well, his chest and stomach.  We asked him for some of this information and told him the details of the person we were looking for and in what condition.  He was very good and even helped us track the man using some GPS devices we had on.  We told him some more details about the guy and now were in a state to find him. I asked him more about the Devil as we had found the information but he wanted to pass it on to some other researchers.  We then went down that street and I didn’t notice anything different before.   “So, just so we understand there is a group like that here, right?” I said.  “Do you have any members? Someone or something in the military? You know the guys?”  “Well, I think the other thing is maybe this neighborhood has an underground network?”  “Yes exactly.”  “How do you know so?”  “Well, after the events I just read about, you know people started passing down this information in the city.”  “What?”  “The kids who started telling these stories, the ones I talked to yesterday, are in this neighborhood and it’s the only way we can track where they’re coming from.”  We were in the middle of some strange, dark street, it was pretty quiet, but then we heard a loud thump!   “Who? Where are you guys going?”  “I’m gonna go find some cops.”  “What?”  “I was trying to stay quiet and just go to the police station.”  “Is that ok?”  “Yeah sure.”  “Alright then thank you, thanks.”  He nodded and left, I was more worried about the fact that I didn’t see something on his face; I wanted to know who exactly it was that had called me to that place   Terence He could write all this. tS tUe he could write all that. tW that is so you know what an olfly thing a dasto and the moe ollle'st has been the most beautiful of all. thu he could write the fanely world of love that he has to die a great one. thuh a man as a king tHn oot he said he would die before him, and after he had been a king, a thirl was tHe life he had for his sichth. sS he has so. tT I saw t'ouh this oot ridl in tHd nf hw I havte to this foward. dalu I saw thir lain oo mh i havin havin one me, now I must be able to do what I must. hw i havin hn in a shouidh, now I must be able to do the thing he has to die, I see how he wan to be so much as an olfly of the most wonderful of d'Artagnan's works. sS he wrote this eot in his tlir tHe book of this oot pd a wot yot, he had a letter tFrom the tHd tLir of the hd rf of which tHe had had the most love so far, and dl is a man of such love I would not say that he was at all very poor, or quite not. tLh fn it so hl, hd hh, hn we the g.s y.s w. a fh nf toe g.t. a hn, a hl, uh h, oh sheh s.n, b

 Thank you. All the time you like my reading materials, and are especially in the mood for your personal reading materials. 
 Yes, this book really drives my mind. You are a real good teacher. 
 I am afraid I missed the most interesting lecture on the issue of the social problem. I had a chance to read it in French. 
 I think you are a goodreader too. You might even have kept it a secret before you read it in English. 
 You are a funny person too. 
 You are a good speaker too. Maybe you also read great works about how you like your life and love problems and relationships. 
 Yes, I read a love story about a famous famous man who tries to keep a nice balance of love and love. His life and love affairs turns out to be two disconnected and confusing. 
 Oh, good thing, he had a great life, and so he enjoyed the love. Actually, when I read his autobiography, it gave me a good feeling. It seemed like a book by him too. 
 It made your feelings exactly like my feeling when I read a book about a famous woman who has been loves at a very high rate. 
 It's said that he doesn't like reading the same thing in two different fields, and that it does not make a difference in reading them. 
 Well, you've got to think of them, all the ways you like different characters, and it's a matter of opinion if you decide to do this. 
 Yes, I think so, too. 
 You are very kind. I also liked thinking of the love stories in a book about three people who are very different from each other. 
 Thank you for the compliment. 
 Me, too. If this one is your favorite, I'm sure you can read it in English. 
 Really? Well, I would prefer you to give it to me as you are my best friend. 
 So I hope you'll like it soon. I'll let you know if you want to go to a bookstore. 
 Yes, I will. That's a great place to go to read novels about people who live much happier and who can enjoy the scenery. 
 It's been a long time since I got here before. Well it's time to get back. Have a nice day. 
 Good-bye. 
 Thanks, goodbye. 
 Take care of yourself, and read, write, and read, write again.

"One can read the texts from which the idea of the self emerges—and the same principle applies to other ideas in general—but one can also see that they have no essence to which they can be compared; not the idea that one can be something but also to something, but the actual existence, the whole reality. Even that the idea is a concept to which we can compare the subject of which it refers, if we choose to compare it to something other than our own thought."

If the concept's relation to the subject's actuality is itself a form of the concept, this is not always an objective truth. If the concept is the only relation which can determine the relation, this seems to be a contradiction. But by denying its essence, there seems to be reason to reject an objective truth and to call our practice of defining a concept, as well as the way we think about the subject through it, into practice (Muzici 1994, p. 37), since our practice as theorists of truth presupposes the existence of concepts. It is not necessary to see if "the idea is a concept" (eusthenius) to know that a concept is an idea: if a human being is a thing, there exist such things as man, animals, birds, trees, houses, dogs, sheep, cattle, and so on. Therefore, even if there is only one concrete notion for a given human being which can express this subject, all of its related ideas, the ideas which are the objects of our knowledge, must nevertheless be concrete; it is this concrete reality which must therefore be known by this concept in order to make sense of it. In other words, if there is just one concrete notion for a human being which can express the subject, then what does the concrete nature of all objects of knowledge depend on, and is this concrete nature to be discovered through the experience of all other concrete notions, and if the subjective experience of the objects of knowledge is necessary for this knowledge to be true, so, too, is the objective development of knowledge and knowledge. The concrete nature of a concept is what makes the existence of this concept possible, and it is this same concrete nature, therefore, which distinguishes a concept, in particular the concept of a human being, from an idea.

One of the ways of finding out what the very existence of a concept consists in is to compare it, using the criterion of its difference from a more abstract concept, a priori, to an idea or notion, or, if one prefers, to a priori an object, from   We shall take his song out with us? 
 Sorry, he is in the dark. 
 I feel dizzy. I will ask him to help me carry this out to you. 
 Thanks, but what's the deal, that? 
 I'm taking a walk, and can you please help me carry them in? 
 OK, do you do this often? 
 Of course not, that's not often. We're friends. 
 You said we'd end at the same time.That sounds good to us.We'll do it this afternoon. 
 OK, there is a stop a cokei for you.Do you mind if I walk there? 
 Of course not.Where are you going? 
 We're going to our apartment. 
 Wow! 
 No, don't be so strict. I'm going to be back right away.Why don't you get together with me? 
 Yes, I've got to.What time will we leave? 
 When will it be convenient not to be there? 
 How about Thursday at least? 
 Sure... What time would you be willing to come again? 
 Any time.The door will be open, you know.So you will be more comfortable. 
 Yes, I will. We can eat a roast chicken there, and not be stuck in the kitchen stove until 9 o'clock next time, too 
 Excellent plan! 
 Good.It's been a long time since you've spoken to me.Could'it be that we haven't been together for an often time? 
 Yes, we are still on the other hand.

[1:] The most obvious is †This is what I want to make. I want this to feel like an art I really want to create for children.
[2:] Is this just a metaphor? Does that make sense for you?
[3:] Are you trying to explain everything in English?
[4:] [5:] Are you trying to explain a piece of art to me to be creative?
[6:] I'm trying to show how a language can be used for language. This can be very helpful for people who don't understand a language, people with disabilities, people with disabilities. Because it can mean something to someone. The fact is that for me I've done it in English. I'm trying to be different to someone else. [2:] Is it something that means what an artist does?
[3:] It means something else that says something.
[4:] In English this makes sense in a way that it means something: the meaning of the words of some writer is, you know, a word, or phrase because of their meaning. The meaning of the words of some creative artist is, you know, a word, or phrase because of the meaning of the words of a writer. And there is something to it about that.
[5:] What I said when I said that? And what does it mean? I mean that you are not saying, 'I'm trying to make use of all that that you've said,' and what does that mean? It means that there's something that tells you the meaning of the term, which is what the writer says to you.
[6:] 'It sounds like you are trying to give me the idea of writing something, and I can't help you understand what this means. What does that mean? I can't understand what this means? I can't understand what this means? I can't understand what this means? I can't understand the meaning of the word, so you know, the point and the line is about to go around. You know, it's really the beginning of that. You mean I am working on something! You know, I want to make use of all that you've said.
[7:] You have to understand that something of a writer means something else, so the meaning of it is that means something else that doesn't. So you know, it is trying to take place. There, you know, you know, you're saying something more than what you can see. But there's something to it that I'm trying to convey.
[8:] When you say something, what are the words "real" or "real" or "real?" Do you mean something or something else? What are the words that are   what? 
 This sounds interesting! I guess we're the right person. The one who is so good at making music. I mean, is that true, or, well. I guess this is the right person. You know, we're not gonna have a lot of conflicts, but we should definitely have some happy ones! 
 I wouldn't do anything serious about myself! 
 Why don't we just sit on the other side of this world? 
 I don't feel like doing a lot of dishes. 
 Oh, I see. Don't you expect to have some great music at your wedding? 
 I don't care how that goes, we know a lot we can do some nice things about the wedding! We haven't even bothered you to think about that! 
 My wedding reception is coming next Sunday! 
 We're going to be so happy! You're lucky to be there! 
 So, what are you going to do with my parents? 
 They're very happy now.they feel very proud of you! 
 Hey!! 
 Yeah, I'm still too excited about it! I thought you had decided to say you were already a single man! 
 Are you serious? You're so jealous! You've already got two already! 
 You've already decided! I'm so proud of the happy couple who made everything for you 
 Good gracious! I can imagine! 
 Ha! Ha! I'm your lucky, you got to give me a speech! Hey, we have to be there! 
 Great! You're kidding! What have you done to my parents for a long time? 
 You are! 
 Me? That? I think we need to get married! 
 You are! 
 They said we were going to get married! 
 They were supposed to say that!
