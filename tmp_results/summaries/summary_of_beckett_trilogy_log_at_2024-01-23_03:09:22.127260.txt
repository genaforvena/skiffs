Merging and summarizing: 
One 
day, just as Macmann was getting used to being loved, though 
without as yet responding as he was subsequently to do, he thrust 
Moll’s face away from his on the pretext of examining her ear- 
rings.But as she made to return to the charge he checked her 
again with the first words that came into his head, namely.Why 
two Christs?, implying that in his opinion one was more than 
sufficient.To which she made the absurd reply.Why two ears?But she Obtained his forgiveness a moment later, saying, with a 
smile (she smiled at the least thing), Besides they are the thieves, 
Christ is in my mouth.Then parting her jaws and pulling down 
her blobber-lip she discovered, breaking with its solitary fang the 
monotomy of the gums, a long yellow canine bared to the roots 
and carved, with the drill probably, to represent the celebrated 
sacrifice.With the forefinger of her free hand shj fingered it.It’s 
loose, she said, one of these fine mornings I’ll wake up and find 
I’ve swallowed it, perhaps I should have it out.She let go her lip, 
which sprang back into place with a smack.This incident made a 
strong impression on Macmann and Moll rose with a bound in 
his affections.And in the pleasure he was later to enjoy, when he 
put his tongue in her mouth and let it wander over her gums, this 
rotten crucifix had assuredly its part.But from these harmless 
aids what love is free?Sometimes it is an object, a garter I believe 
or a sweat-absorber for the armpit.And sometimes it is the simple 
image of a third party.

A few words in conclusion on the decline 
of this liaison.No, I can’t.Weary with my weariness, white last moon, sole regret, not 
even.To be dead, before her, on her, with her, and turn, dead 
on dead, about poor mankind, and never have to die any more, 
from among the living.Not even, not even that.My moon was 
here below, far below, the little I was able to desire.And one 
day, so/n, soon, one earthlit night, beneath the earth, a dying 
being will say, like me, in the earthlight, Not even, not even that, 
and die, without having been able to find a regret.Moll.I’m going to kill her.She continued to look after Mac- 
mann, but she was no longer the same.When she had finished 
cleaning up she sat down on a chair, in the middle of the room.266

and remained without stirring.If he called her she went and 
perched on the edge of the bed and even submitted to be titillated.But it was obvious her thoughts were elsewhere and her only 
wish to return to her chair and resume the now familiar gesture 
of mastaging her stomach, slowly, weighing on it with her two 
hands.She was also beginning to smell.She had never smelt 
sweet, but between not smelling sweet and giving off the smell she 
was giving off now there is a gulf.She was also subject to fits 
of vomiting.Turning away, so that her lover should only see her 
convulsive' back, she vomited at length on the floor.Summarization models summary:
