My region was always the same sky, earth, and soil, day after day, with no change in any direction.
Despite the possibility that regions merge into one another, Molloy has left her region many times, thinking she was still within it, but she preferred to abide by her simple feeling and its voice.
The idea of an endless, unchanging world is something I have struggled with my whole life. I've grown up in a small town with nothing but mountains as far as the eye can see, and I've always felt trapped by it.
But then again, maybe that's just me projecting my own limitations onto others

I was riding a bicycle in the dark along empty country roads.

I have a store of sixteen stones, four of which are in each pocket of my trousers and two pockets of my greatcoat.
I distribute the stones equally between my four pockets and suck them turn ahd turn about.
After sucking, I replace each stone from the right pocket of the greatcoat with another one from the left pocket.
Despite rearranging the stones, the circulation of the stones always returns to their initial distribution.
How do you explain this phenomenon?
Here's a visual representation of the situation:

Pants = 4 stones (one in each pocket)
Greatcoat pockets = 2 stones

I have sixteen pockets each containing a stone and only four pockets.
Increasing the number of pockets increases my chances of enjoying my stones until their number is exhausted.
Even if I had eight pockets, I would have sucked at least eight of my stones.

Then he put two stones in each pocket, one on top of the other, and tied a string around them to keep them together. This solution was much more elegant than his previous one.

After redistribution, I transferred the five stones to the supply pocket in my trousers, which I replaced by the six stones in the left pockets of my trousers.
