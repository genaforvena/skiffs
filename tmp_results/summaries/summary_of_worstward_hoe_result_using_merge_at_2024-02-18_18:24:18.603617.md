Amidst conflicting perspectives or emotions ('missaid,' 'mind,' 'pain,' 'bones'), the speaker struggles to comprehend the situation fully.

An old man and a young child walk side by side through this void. The old man raises his hand as if wanting to hold the child's hand while they journey forward together into another realm where none exists - symbolizing the transfer of knowledge from older generations to younger ones as age passes onwards.

This story delves into themes such as transformation, overcoming challenges through determination, intergenerational connections, and navigating through darkness towards an uncertain future.

The characters' thoughts and emotions undergo sudden changes throughout the scene. They move slowly while holding hands in a dim void, reflecting an atmosphere of uncertainty and vulnerability. Their eyes are described as staring which might indicate alertness or confusion. Both have crippled hands, possibly signifying physical weakness or injury that adds to their overall appearance of frailty.

In this story, the driver was pulled over by a police officer for speeding and having an expired license. The man explained his situation of needing to be at the hospital due to his wife's unexpected hospitalization. Instead of giving him only one ticket for speeding, the officer also gave him another ticket for driving without proper documentation. However, the policeman offered him a chance to attend traffic school instead of paying fines immediately which would help him avoid further consequences related to his license expiration.



The poem appears to delve into abstract concepts related to time, consciousness, and existence with an unconventional structure and choice of words.

Overall, this poem explores diverse facets of human existence while emphasizing that there is no inherent wrongness in any aspect mentioned.
