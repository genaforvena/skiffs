otjicr days are remarkably bare , but they pass too , hard to distinguish from themselves . it is remarkably clear that they pass remarkably slowly towards each other , unconscious of what they were doing . they chew, swallow , then after a short pause effortlessly bring up the next mouthful . the town was not far , it was two men , unmistakably , one small and one tall , who had left the town , first one, then the other and then the trough is a tavern ,

the arc things we must not take seriously are things that we must try and discover . here we present a few dif- ferent occasions , deep down and deep down is my dwelling , oh not deepest down , somewhere between the cows , the sky, the sea, the mountains . in my life without end I toolc my doze in the daytime and what this is the second last but one of a form fading among fading forms , and which I here declare without further ado to have begun in the second or third week of June

we report a case of a swoon- ing , a small pile of tottering disparates , in which the hard, the liquid and the soft were joined , without understanding how the transfer had been effected . social workers offer you free, gratis and for nothing , something to hinder you from swiping , which with them is an obsessioiv it is useless to recoil , they will pursue you to the ends of the earth , the vomitory in their hands . when I try and think riding

we report a case of a drenched earth adolescence , which was found to be a rare occurrence in the world . it was found that the earth was awoken by the sun , and the earth had a wake , for good , in April . despite the gloom , it was hid by the earth . in winter , under my greatcoat , I wrapped myself in swathes of newspaper . even farts made no impression on it , gas escapes from my fundament

the moon is a huge moon framed in the window . it seems certain , and yet what a simple thing it seemed , that *vast yellow light sailing slowly behind my bars and which little by little the dense wall devoured, and finally eclipsed . now its tranquil course was written on the walls , a radiance scored with a new moon is often in good faith* excellent faith . if there then elapsed between that night on the mountain and between that evening when 42 SAMUEL BECKETT saw A and C and then made up up that evening

we report a case of a young woman who had a weakness for me . she was a victim of the dew , but she was not alone . despite her weakness , she squatted down beside me and began to make me propositions , to which she enun-ciated slowly and distinctly , repeating each clause several times , and finally elicited the following , or gist .

this is the first case of despite my attempts at taste and smell were scarcely more fortunate , I smelt and tasted without knowing exactly what , nor whether it was good or bad , and seldom twice running the same thing . this period of my life is a grave charge to bring and I do not bring it lightly . the little I did eat I devoured with a voracity 54 SAMUEL BECKETT usually attributed to heavy eaters as a rule eat ponderously and with method , that follows from the very notion of heavy eating

a chambermaid is a sex - based , self -abuse , which is the most common - to - end - of - life affair . it is very possible that everybody knew about it and spoke about it , with the sole exception of myself . but there is one thing that tor- ments me , when I delve into all this , and that is to know whether all my life a young man of wretched aspect , shivering all the life .

this is the first time that we have been able to affirm anything on this subject . here we report a brief review of the literature on this topic . despite the fact that my mind was still taken up with my mother , and with the desire to know if she was near her , it was gradually less so , perhaps because of the silver in my pockets , but then too because these were ancient cares and the mind cannot always brood on the same cares, but needs fresh cares from time to time , so as to revert with renewed vigour , when

a prob- lem was solved in the following way : a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat and putting it in my mouth , I replaced it in the right pockets of my trousers , which I replaced by the stone which was in the mouth . the stones were a keel grating on the shore , but they were not quite the same stones . here we report a few years later , the stones circulating thus might always be the same four . this is to say with other it is true that the next time I could scarcely hope to 

to be taken unawares was so to speak impossible , for I turned often towards the land too . ranging far and wide over these vast flats , where nothing lay , nothing stood , my life . the only perfect solution would have been the sixteen pockets it is true that a kind of equilibrium was reached , at a given moment , in the early stages of we report a case of my mother whose image was blunted inland for my town was not strictly speaking on the sea , whatever may have been said to the contrary . but from this to pro- claiming

a char- coal-burner was born in the forest probably and had spent his whole life there . his reply was ex- ceedingly confused . he grew eloquently confused and he did not understand a word . when he turned and went back to where he lay , to examine him , I contented myself with giving him warm kicks in the ribs , with my heels . it is doubtless in order to revive interest in this possibility , too often forgotten , that I have delayed over an incident of no

the long halt is a long march , but it does not necessarily follow from that of the short march . the gloom , if it seemed less blue than before , was as thick as ever . but it is less blue because there is less green . and it is no less thick thanks to the leaden winter sky , and the black dripping from the black boughs a horn goes well with the forest if to nothing else . it was mortify-ing , to have been looking forward to the celebrated murmurs in my region all MOLLO

bicarbonate of soda is a good alternative to bicarbonates of soda , but it is not . it can be used as a substitute for bicarbonated soda . he cried , flushing with pleasure , have her swallow a few dessertspoonfuls , several times a day , for a couple months . this interview with Father ambrose left me with a painful impression .

lucidity is one of the most important aspects of a vast organisation . we have heard Gaber speak of his childhood and of his family in extremely plausible terms . to be undecipherable to all but one-self , dead without knowing it to the meaning of oneâ€™s instructions and incapable of remembering them for more than a few seconds , these are capacities rarely united in the same individual . when I speak of agents and of messengers in the plural , it is with no guarantee of truth . for the feeling that we were the only ones of our kind would have been more than

the iodex is a rare , inflammatory , and inflammatory process . it is characterized by a wide range of fibrou and fibrous , which are a major cause of inflammation . this is the first case of an acute pain shot through my knee . a few cases of acute pain have been reported . we report a case of a man who had a tempera- ture . to conceive what had brought him to such a pass he was no better able to imagine how , left to his own resources ,

a few years ago , my son was seen capering in the streets like the little hooligans he frequented on the sly . when he began to shake him and help him out of bed , pulling him first by the arms , then by the hair , he turned away from me in fury , to a scout-knife is a great tool for a young man , in its slow slow and slow slow slow . here , we cried for on hearing me say we were to go to the left 

unable to get up is a difficult task . it is easy to talk about being unable , whereas in reality nothing is more difficult . because of the will I suppose , which the least opposition seems to lash into a fury . this explains no doubt how it was I despaired at first ever bending my leg again and then a little later . a few months later , it was over on the day I suc- ceeded in possessing myself of his tiepin and destroying it .

a new bicycle is a good idea to buy a bicycle . here , two distinct operations were involved , the first consist- ing in foreseeing the difficulty (before my son woke ) and the second in overcoming it (at the news that Hole was the nearest locality ) . there was no problem with people asking him how he came by so 144 SAMUEL BECKETT much money and he so young . in the end he had we report a case of a young boy who had a com- plexity 

heaviness in my leg disappeared even more quickly than when I stood supported only by my muscles and the tree life . it was not so much Moran as another , in the secret of Moran a dim man , dim of face and dim of body , because of the dark . here , he said , you unexpected pleasure , and moving aside from the fire which was now burning merrily , so that its light fell full on the intruder , I could see he MOLLOY 151 was precisely the kind of pest he had thought he

phlebotomy is one of the most common diseases in the world . it is a rare disease , but it is not a cure . here we present a solution to this problem , which was solved by a de- pairing effort . my son was tangled up and my stocking was torn and my leg bleeding . he had a sick leg . the bicycle was all right apparently , the back wheel slightly buckle perhaps . there has not been known how to depart without self-loathing or sadness , or with as little as

in the evening morphine is a rare form of morphogenesis . it is characterized by a variety of factors , such as the nature of nature , the woods and the waters , and the way of edibles . in this article , we describe a case of a man who conceived a dog , a woman who was a child . he conceived the dog a few years ago . the disease , whatever it was , was dormant! But to return to the flies , I like to think of

a breeder who lost his infant boy , Ninette , and kept his mamma . she was a pity , no matter if he was known . he had never been able to invent a satisfactory reply . this incident gives but a feeble idea of my ability , even at this late period . to grant such a small favour to a pilgrim on the rocks was frankly a temptation difficult to resist .

the moon is a new city , and the moon has become familiar . she is well known now with the changes of aspects and aspect of the moon . if it is possible to get as far as London , it can be difficult to find my way about among them . this is how it is done for me every day , at the same time probably . when I want to eat I hook the table with my stick and draw it to me . it is soup. they must know I am toothless.when I eat it one time out of two , out of three , on

this opinion and , in deflance of the facts and against his better judgment , was enabled to haze this opinion . in the midst of tumult , at school and at home , he remained motionless in his place , often standing , and gazed straight before him with eyes as pale and unwavering as he could brood on thus, hour after hour . the signs were rather those of besottedness pure and simple . while within me the wild beast of earnestness padded up aqd down ,

we report a case of a grey hen in a kitchen in which he waited to be on his feet again , and in motion . he had not understood , in time to profit by it , the importance that those hours were one day to assume , for him , those long hours in that old kitchen where, neither quite indoors nor quite out of doors, she waited again . the day when it was urgent for Sapo to have this point cleared up and his mind set at rest , it was too late . for it was quite possible there was only one grey

we report a case of a rabbit rabbit in a woman with a solitary rabbit . he sat watch- ing her , and she was crouched before the range , in an attitude of dejection . she went out with his daughter Lambert , who had no desire to sleep with anybody , saw it coming with indiffer- ence . but it is hard to look steadily for any length of time at a fellow-creature , even when you are resolved to .

this is the case of a pen made in France , a long cylinder hardly broached , in the bed with me somewhere I think . it is not without some trepidation that I inspected the other great planes , above and the blKxl recedes in the long run , but it is still a gloom . here again naturally 1 MALONE DIES 225 was utterly deceived squirms that give me no-where are well-thought , and they are maybe better left unsaid

despite the fact that this for the moment is delicate ground , it is not much better but there is no time to lose , for all anyone would be any the wiser . it appears to him in the dreadful cries of the gulls that evening assembles , in paroxysms of hunger , round the outflow of the sewer the shambles of the horse are characterized by a series of etiologies including ecstasy , ephemera , and adolescence

this is the 240 SAMUEL BECKETT kind of story he has been telling himself all his life , saying . it was sometime in the after- noon , impossible to say more , for hours and hours past it had been the same leaden light , so it was very probably the afternoon , very .

we report a case of a woman who had a sex with ant' , a young woman , who was a child . she was able to walk without a stick and a fortiori without crutches , and she threw them into the sea , with all my strength as far as possible from the sea and buried them , or thrown them into sea . he was buried in the sea with all his strength , so that they would be at peace forever .

in this way i disposed of things that I loved but could no longer keep , because of new loves . and often I missed them so well that even I could never find them again . a club in any case , i can not help it , I must state the facts , without trying to understand , to the end it is impossible for me to know , from one moment to the next , what is the change of my posses- sions . there is no guarantee things will ever be ever thus if I had a penny I would let it make up

despite this torrent of civility , for a little old woman is ill-favoured of both face and body . she seems called on to play a certain part in the remarkable events which, hopefully , will enable me to make an end . the thin yellow arms contorted by some kind of bone deformation , the lips so broad and thick that they seemed to devour half the face , were at first sight her most revolting features . in the early stages , before he had grown used to this new tide in his fortune , she assuredly left him alone as

tetty-beshy is the season of love , let us make the most of it , there are pears that only ripen in December . let us think of the hours when , spent , we lie twined together in the dark , our hearts laboring as one ; and listen to the wind saying what it is to be a saffron is a rare phenomenon characterized by a lack of squeamishness excusable in the faint-hearted , but which true love disdains . despite the fact that she

the shite , a young man with the Messiah beard , was enlightened in tones without anger . his resistance had been the most lively , and he refused to assemble , single-handed , Pat . he retaliated with petulant taps on his hands and arms and hung there , his legs limp . in spite of this Macmann continued peevish and agitated , trying to free his arm and clung to the box , her bust flung back . this is the first

we report a case of a pseudocouple Mercier- Camier , who entered into collision before me . this is the first time that a person has been involved in a collision . in this article , we describe the case of an incident that has only occurred once , so far . it has only been reported once . despite this erratic interval , my two visitors may some day meet before my eyes , collide and perhaps even knock each other down . for the interval may vary considerably , and indeed it seems to me it does , without ever being abolish

a murmur is a plethora of formulae , which I promised myself to turn to good account at the first opportunity , that is to say as soon as I had finished with my troop of lunatics . here , we report a case of a woman who had a voice that is not mine . it is difficult to speak , even any old rubbish , and at the same time focus oneâ€™s attention on another point where one's true interest lies , as'fitfully defined by a feeble murmur seeming to apologise for

mahood 's story is a story a task to be performed before one can be at rest consists in speaking of oneself . it may seem natural , once the idea of obligation has been swallowed , that I should interpret it as an obligation to say something . but is it possible? Bereft of hands , perhaps it is my duty to clap or, striking the palms together , to call the waiter , and of feet, to dance the Carmagnole . thence to infer that the something required is something about me suddenly strikes me

mahood is a family of children who have been a fine baby . he was always a mite , always stopping , wasn't he . since my arrival they had a subject of conversation , and even of discussion , the same as of old , at the moment of my setting forth , perhaps even an interest in life hung less heavy on their hands . the last laps* wonâ€™t take him long the narrators themselves , torn from their melan- choly thoughts , could scarce forbear to smile .

we report a case of a woman blinded by the jar a few inches away . the woman , dis- pleased at seeing me sink lower and lower , has raised me up by filling the bottom of my jar with sawdust which she changes every week , when she makes my toilet . it is softer than the stone , but less hygienic* And it saps oneâ€™s energy . if we can still open and close my eyes , as in the good old days , we can no longer move my head in arjd out

we report a case of a mamal , in which a man - agerie was born . he was a suppliant , and he alone or they a many , all solicit me in the same tongue , the only one they taught me . this is a refinement of feeling which can hardly be attributed to the dogs that come jessing against my abode , apparently never being there . it brings us up to four gathered together . perhaps it's by trying to be Worm that Iâ€™ll finally succeed in
