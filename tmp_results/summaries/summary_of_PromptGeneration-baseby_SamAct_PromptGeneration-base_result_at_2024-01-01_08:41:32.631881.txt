I’m in my mother’s room.
My beginning of the end.
A new generation
I’m chewing on a road.
Is there a will there is a way? Two hundred miles from home to the bench.
The last and the next hundred years of my life
I saw a man with a stick.
I’m still there, I’m still there, I’m still there
The last time I saw my dog.
The last time I saw an orange pomeranian.
Time to catch the dog.
I’ve said it’s my only chance to talk to him, I’ve said it’s my only chance to talk to him
I’m not alone, I’m with me
Can I lose my hat and my greatcoat?
I have seen a man with a stick.
Let me hear the noise of the night.
I shall never see again.
I went down there, I thought I had a bicycle.
I have a horn.
My mother never saw me.
The last time I called her Ma.
I’m not scared of ammonia.
knocking on the head for money.
I forgive her for having spoilt me.
My sweet little wizened pear.
Is there a need for police escortage?
A beginning of the end: I'm not going to sit down for long hours on my crutches.
A new look at the end of old problems
I am being questioned by a police officer.
Fear and fury
I did not know my name at first.
The last time I cried my name is Molloy.
The last time I had a cup of tea.
I am not going to jail for throwing a bicycle at people.
How long will I live with this?
If I have always behaved like a pig.
Let me cry out.
A little pebble in my hand.
The last time I saw a donkey.
My mother is gone, I’m going to see her again
I’m going to get myself out of this ditch.
The last time I saw my eyes.
The last time I saw a shepherd.
I heard the shepherd whistle, and I saw the sheep.
The last time I went to my mother.
I am still in my shell.
I cannot believe I am in the right place at the right time.
I have a new name for my town.
My dear readers, I've been trying to invent the name of my town.
I am not going to let go of my pet.
The last time I saw my dear old man.
He is not all his wits about me.
I’ve forgotten.
How much is too much? I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I
And I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve
The house where Lousse died
I have gone in terror of my own countryman, and I have gone in terror of others.
The last time I dug a hole.
The last time I saw her.
When I was younger I used to live in the drawing-room with my mother.
The last time I saw my mum.
My bed in the dark.
The last time I fell asleep.
The last and the next hundred years of my life
The Place Where I Am and Where I Go
A new world at the end of the line
The new moon.
The last time I saw my mum.
Can I forget who I am and where I am at night?
THE ORIGIN AND DIFFERENTIATION OF MICROGLIAL CELLS
I pushed them; I pushed them; I pushed them; I pushed them; I pushed them; I pushed them; I pushed them; I pushed them; I am
The last time I saw a man wearing a nightdress.
I cannot believe I am leaving. I cannot believe I am leaving.
The last time I checked my pockets for change.
The last time I saw an Irish knife.
I cannot help but I cannot help you with this.
I have a good time coming.
Looking for my bicycle.
I would rather live in her than in me.
A new look at the way we feel.
The last time I saw her.
The last and the beginning of the end of the line.
I’m still there, I’m still there, I’m still there
How I heard them for first time
I thought I saw the world through my own eyes.
The last time I left home.
Is there a limit to the number of windows in my head?
The last time I saw my friends.
The last time I looked at this place.
Is there a need for me to be watched?
My life is sweet and sour.
How I feel after a week's work in the dark- and light-adapted mouse symbiont systems.
From time to time I fell.
I cannot remember the last time I ate bread on a tray.
The last time I said I was wrong with Lousse.
I am still waiting for my first encounter with a woman.
