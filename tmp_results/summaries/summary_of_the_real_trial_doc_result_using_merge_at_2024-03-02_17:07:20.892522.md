The Bank issued tokens and dollars, but no one implemented the purpose for that. The prisoner, fearing discovery, buried or planted the dies by which the impression was made. He hid the coin in the garret and the plates with the words printed on them in the chamber. He also hid the paper with the Bank of England promissory note in the room over the dairy. The officers found the necessary materials to make the paper in the granary, and the prisoner and his family used them to make the paper. They were charged with forging a Bank of England note for 1l.

Summary of the following text in form of imaginary python code: Richard Ingeley was servant to the prisoner when prisoner was taken—he had worked for him several years; prisoner gave to witness a plate about a fortnight before he was taken, and told him to take it and plant it—witness took it, it was wrapped in paper; he dug a hole and planted the plate in the wheat field adjoining the rick-yard; on the Friday after Booth was apprehended he shewed Chillingworth where he had planted it.One of the punches with figures in cut on ivory, for the purpose of stamping the Nos.on the notes, being shewn to witness, he says he has seen Booth using such as that in the room over the parlour, upon papers like notes, on which there was printing; they made marks on the paper when so used; there were rollers in that chamber—he has seen them used; he has seen Mrs. Booth and Mrs. Chidlow use them when Booth was in the room—they had boards, cloths, large plates, and papers—he has seen them so used several times, but does not recollect the exact times when.—The copper-plates on which the words of the 1l.notes were engraved were then shewn to witness: he has seen those plates used, those are called the large plates—and on being shewn the narrow plates, with the date upon them, he says he has seen those also used, those are what they called lines, first they used the large plates—they used them to print with; they put paper upon them, and then put them between the cloths and boards, and then through the rollers; then they used the small plates or lines—they put a note on a board, then put this narrow plate on the note; his mistress (Mrs. Booth) then put the boards in on one side between the rollers, and Mrs. Chidlow pulled them out on the other; the notes were then hung on strings to dry, near the fire: he saw Booth using the punch with letters and figures on the Thursday night before he was taken, and the narrow plates were used between two and three oclock that same afternoon—the narrow plates were used first, and then Booth used the punch, but Mrs. Booth and Mrs. Chidlow were at work with the lines at the same time that Booth was at work with the punch.Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford.—Is no scholar
