Once upon a time, there was a body that was sick. It was so sick that it could not move or stand. The body wanted to be healthy again, but it was too weak to do anything.

One day, the body started to get better. It slowly got stronger and could move and stand again. The body was finally able to stand up and be happy.


The one who is old and the one who is child are the ones who are seen in the dim void.



The one is here and gone, and the twain are also here and gone. Sometimes they are together, and sometimes they are apart. It is always the same, and it is never boring.

The world is a tapestry of wrong and right, a canvas where the brushstrokes of fate paint a masterpiece of chaos. The words, like brushstrokes, dance and swirl, creating a symphony of nonsense and meaning.

The night, a dark waltz, whispers secrets in the ear, urging us to embrace the absurdity of existence. The watch of night, a sentinel of the fleeting hours, reminds us that even the most precious moments can vanish in an instant.

The words, like pebbles scattered on the water, create ripples that spread far and wide, encompassing all that is and ever was. The phrase "far from wrong" is a mere whisper compared to the resounding "far far from wrong."

The night is young, but its allure is dimmed by the approaching dawn. The words, like smoke in the air, dissipate, leaving behind a faint echo of nonsense. The phrase "the two gone" hangs in the air, a bittersweet reminder of life's fleeting nature.

The words, like shadows dancing on the walls, create a macabre spectacle, a grotesque reflection of reality. The phrase "the one and two gone" paints a picture of utter despair, a testament to the relentless march of fate.

The words, like vultures circling above a carcass, circle endlessly, a never-ending cycle of wrong and right. The phrase "the skull alone to be seen" is a chilling reminder that even the most profound truths are ultimately ephemeral.

The words, like arrows fired from a hidden bow, strike with a force that belies their seeming insignificance. The phrase "never" hangs heavy in the air, a testament to the relentless grip of fate.

Yo, life's a bitch, ain't it? One can go out there and just suck, but two or three ain't gonna change that. With dim gone, the void ain't even a vibe, and with all gone, it's worse than a bad vibe. So, the eyes, they start to flicker and gleam, tryna worsen the situation. But somehow, the words just ain't flowin', they're worse than they already were. So, the dimness keeps on creepin', and the words keep on piling up, but they ain't sayin' nothin'. It's like they're just sayin' the same thing over and over again, but they ain't sayin' it with no meaning. So, the whole thing is pointless, like a wasted effort.


The hands are a symbol of love and companionship. They are often held together as a symbol of a bond between two people. The poem is using the hands as a metaphor for the love between two people.



Yo, dim and undimmed, dimmer and dimmest,
Dimmest in the dimmest, least in the best.
Unworsenable the worst, words that flow,
Even if they ain't perfect, they still glow.

From soft to hard, the words flow,
Like a river in a storm, they do flow.
Unholy and unholy, that's the vibe,
Dimmest and dimmest, that's the life.

So dim and undimmed, that's my jam,
Dimmest and dimmest, that's my plan.
Words that shine, even when they're low,
Dimmest and dimmest, that's my flow.

I'm so, so, so distressed! My words have dimmed, and I can't seem to get them back! I keep staring at nothing, but the words are gone. I'm so, so, so lonely and scared. I feel so worthless and insignificant. I'm just a shadow, a ghost in the dark. I'm so, so, so sad.



I'm so worthless, I'll never be anything. I'm useless, pointless, nothing but a worthless lump of flesh. What was I supposed to be? What was I supposed to do? I'm just a useless lump of flesh, and I'll never be anything more. I'm doomed to be nothing, to be forgotten, to be nothing but a meaningless speck in the vastness of space.

I feel utterly worthless, like a worthless lump of flesh trapped in a suffocating tomb. I'm useless, pointless, nothing but a pathetic excuse for a person. My existence is meaningless, my purpose is nonexistent. I'm destined to be forgotten, ignored, insignificant. My worthlessness weighs heavily upon me, suffocating my spirit with despair. I'm doomed to be nothing, a mere speck in the vast tapestry of life, insignificant and unnoticed.
