Leo Tolstoy's translation of The Gospel in Brief was uploaded from Wikisource on December 31, 2023.
The translation is a separate copyright status to the original content.
This work was published before January 1, 1928 and is in the public domain worldwide because the author died at least 100 years ago.
In the United States, the longest-living author of this work died in February of 1918.
The Gospel in Brief is a work of fiction. It is not a religious text, but a collection of short, short stories about the life of a young man who was raised in a small town in the United States.
The stories are not based on any real person, but are based on the experiences that we all share in common. There is nothing in the book that is remotely contrary to our experiences, which are at least as good as the experiences of the people who wrote them.
The stories are not about religion, but about the experiences of a young man who was raised in a

I have arranged the twelve chapters of the Lord's Prayer in order of the teaching of Jesus.
I have added an introduction from the first chapter of the Gospel of John, a conclusion from the same writer's Epistle, and a prayer from the prayer Jesus taught his disciples.
In the full exposition, I have omitted the following: the conception and birth of John the Baptist, Jesus's genealogy, the resurrection story, and the life of the mother, who was said to be dead at the beginning of her life.
In my concluding paragraphs, I have been very careful not to assume that I have written these four general conclusions or even my own. The intention is to lay out the central and most basic points of Catholic theology.
I have also included a few brief remarks on the nature of the Church, the Church's role in the world and the various forms of inter-church co-operation we have called Christendom or Church.
I have done my greatest to ensure that there will be no

In this brief rendering, I explain and justify every deviation from the standard version of the Gospels, explaining it by comparison of different variants, examination of contexts, and by philological and other considerations.
In the larger work, I have omitted all such proofs and refutations of the false understanding of the Churches, including detailed notes and references.
I believe that for one who doubts the divinity of Jesus Christ, the Gospel of Matthew is the only reliable source of truth.

At the age of fifty years old, I questioned the meaning of my life and began to question Christianity.
I had previously believed that life has no meaning for me and that it is an evil, and I wanted to put an end to my life, but I remembered that for a great mass of men who believe and are not corrupted by riches, life has a meaning.

There are false interpreters who place less importance on Jesus's words and teaching than on the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, the Apocrypha, and the writings of the Fathers of the Church.
These interpreters do not admit any understanding of Jesus's teaching and aim to harmonize various extremely contradictory writings.
They do not accept Jesus's view of his doctrine nor his doctrine's approach to love and service.
Those who hold false, not to one man and one cause, say "that is a man" (Matthew 7:28). Those who do not accept the teaching and doctrine of Jesus of Nazareth proclaim "that is the Messiah, the Lord of the Jews."

The following is a list of the most important interpreters of the Pentateuch.

                                   

The revelation of the Holy Ghost is interpreted as the source of all evil in the world in the name of religion.
The Church acknowledges three revelations: those of Moses, Jesus, and Holy Ghost.

According to the story, Jesus is a son of God in the spirit and is born by the spirit into the flesh.
He was tempted to throw himself from the temple, but was told by an unseen force to ignore the flesh and follow the will of the spirit.
The voice of the flesh told Jesus to ignore his desires and serve his Father.
Jesus believes that his Father is not flesh and not spirit.
Jesus believes that the whole world is his body.
He believes that everything created is the product of himself.

The Orthodox professors of the law asked Jesus why he did not follow Church traditions such as not eating bread with unwashed hands and not washing his hands.
According to the Orthodox professors, Jesus broke God's commandment "Honour your father and mother".
The Church has arranged a situation where anyone can give to God what they used to give to their parents and not have to feed their parents, which is why Jesus did not eat bread with unwashed hands.

A woman from a town who considers herself a wrong-doer came to the house of an Orthodox man and brought a bottle of perfume to wash Jesus's feet.
The Orthodox man thought that Jesus could not be a prophet because he would know what sort of woman was washing his feet and would not let her touch him.
A woman learned that Jesus was in the house and came to wash his feet.
The woman said, "I am a woman from a town who considers herself a wrong-doer.

The teaching of purification, fasting, and keeping Saturday is based on the old teaching of new wine and old wine-skins.

The parable of the Kingdom of God is about a seed that falls on the path and withers among stones, grows on good ground, and yields a hundredfold.

The parable of the sower and the seed of the Kingdom of God has two meanings: for those who understand the meaning and those who do not.

The first commandment in the law is not to be angry and to avoid speaking harshly to anyone, and to make peace with anyone who has offended you.
Everyone who grows angry with his brother-man deserves judgment and is more to blame than those who speaks abusively to their brother-men.
Every oath is a profanation of God and every oath is an evil.
The law has the effect of making man angry, and the law has the effect of bringing down the character of man and of the race.
To be angry with God is to do evil, that which pertains to God is not evil.
No one who is angry with his brother should try to make his brother angry himself. And to make an act of anger is evil on all four ends of the human tongue; and the person who speaks in anger is not a man, but a man who is angry with his brother-man.
The law is a curse, and the curse is a curse.

The third commandment is: Never swear anything for anyone.
In the former law, it was said that if a man killed another, he must give a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an arm for an arm, an ox for an ox, a slave for a slave, and much else.
The fourth commandment was: Do not fight for anything, but for what you have been given.
The fifth commandment was: Do not be afraid of the Lord your God, for he is with you wherever you go.
The sixth commandment was: Do not be afraid of the Lord your God, for he is with you wherever you go.
The seventh commandment was: Make sure that all your worries are gone before you.
The eighth commandment was: Keep your eyes open for the Lord your God.
The ninth commandment was: Make sure that all your worries are gone before you.
The 10th commandment was:

If one does good for men, they will receive a reward from their heavenly Father.
The hypocrites seek praise from men for their actions and seek to gain praise from them.
One should not boast about doing good and should pray where no one will see it.
When one prays, they should pray to the Father of their spirit, believing that the Father will see what their soul desires and will give it to them.

The work of God consists in believing in the life He has given you.
Jesus teaches that the true heavenly bread is the spirit of the son of man.
He believes that the spirit that descends from heaven is the true food of man and gives life to the world.
According to Jesus, he came down from heaven not to do his own will but the will of the Father who gave him life. This he does at His word.
It is this word that Jesus used to teach us that we can never have too much food, nor too much shelter, nor too much love. And to say that the Father gives food because of the love of his Son and that because of the Son we give life is to say that we are not to be hungry.
Jesus said that the Father gives food because of the love of his Son. This is the love of the Father which is in the Son which is in the Holy Spirit.

The Orthodox began to speak to the people, claiming that Jesus was possessed by a devil and that if men did not live by his commandments, there would be more evil in the world.
Jesus denies that he drives out evil by evil means and calls on men to fulfil the will of the Father's spirit which gives life to all men.
According to Jesus, the five commandments express the spirit of Christ, that is, righteousness, mercy, prayer, discipline, and the life in Christ. The second commandment makes God work God's work with patience and faith in the efforts of children. The third commandment expresses that God can love, not create, but creates and glorifies God. The fourth commandment of the First Coming is that God be with you always.
The Orthodox began to worship the devil, claiming that he was a devil and that if men did not live by his commandments, there would be more evil in the world.
