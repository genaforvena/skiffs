Summarizing: ﻿PREFACE.[Illustration]
_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it.There is much more difference as
to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them.And in the sect--fairly large and yet
unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
novels.To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger
Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
delicacy and keeping.The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and
Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them.__I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present
book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma._It is the larger, the more varied, the
more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the
Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody.On the other hand,
I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly.It
seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show
cause._

Summary: 
Walt Whitman makes a distinction between "loving by allowance" and "loving with personal affection" when it comes to books.
He believes there is a difference between authors who are loved by personal affection and those whose work is loved by convention.
In the sect of Austenians or Janites, there are many Austenian and Janite fans who are passionate about their works.
Some Austen



Summarizing: _In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death.I do not know whether, in this
combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
possesses over all the others.The plot, though not elaborate, is almost
regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story.The elopement of Lydia
and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de
théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.
Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the
same unostentatious, but masterly fashion.There is no attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think
the best feature of that otherwise admirable book.Although Miss Austen
always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given
by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love.I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare
say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery.But if the attempt were made, it would
certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once on the stage.__I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist.It sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite
consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical.

Summary: 
The plot of Pride and Prejudice was written by Jane Austen when she was only twenty-one years old and was revised and finished at Chawton some fifteen years later.
The book was not published until 1813, four years before Austen's death.
Lydia and Wickham's elopement is not a coup de théâtre like the elopements of



Summarizing: But a very badly-built
novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths.And despite the
ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one
should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her
faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John
Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,
but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
superior to them.__The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
apprehended by different persons.To me this humour seems to possess a
greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of
the numerous species of this great British genus.The differences of
scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr.Spectator,” and in
Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
masculine.But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects.Also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty.It is the custom with those
who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the
savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness
of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much
protest.Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a
restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
roasting and cutting up a fool.A man in the early eighteenth century,
of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early
nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,
would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the
innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
at blind-man’s-buff.

Summary: 
Jane Austen's humour is subtle, delicate, and delicate, with subtle and delicate characteristics that are easier to apprehend than to express.
Her humour has a greater affinity to that of Addison than to any other species of British genus.
There is a distinctly feminine element to Jane's character, Mr.Spectator, who describes how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blind-man



Summarizing: But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel
of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected
Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been
written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the
days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I
think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s
own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
her son.But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the
English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous
falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire.If cynicism means
the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells
beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then
every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a
fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
a cynic.And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one.She may even
have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she
took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
work her fools and her mean persons.I think she did take this delight,
and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she
was immensely the better for it as an artist.__In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed
that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that
we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature
painter.To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling
at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than
of Cosway or any of his kind.And I am not so certain that I should
myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her.If her world is a
microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
littleness.She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
feel herself called to touch.It is at least remarkable that in two very
short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not
much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
single failure.

Summary: 
The character of the damsel of 14 who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely is portrayed as a more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet.
Some critics have found “cynicism” in aspects of Miss Austen’s works, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove's self-deceiving regrets over her son.
The word "cynical" is often



Summarizing: It is possible that the romantic paste in her
composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly
anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century
seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality.Even Scott
required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and
German to enable them to chip the classical shell.Miss Austen was an
English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when
ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might
pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the
gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
taste or judgment.Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost
touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey
even in a black one.__For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
only genius knows.The one was humanity, and the other was art.On the
first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are
true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she
has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes
the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive.Take almost any
Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously
piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression.You get
none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
shape a real impression out of the rest.But with Miss Austen the
myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous.When (to take the present book
only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.
Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs.Bennet would have
stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_
himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the
breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with
just and outspoken admiration.Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I
should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her
to Addison in others.__This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.
Collins.Mr.Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison
ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself.It has
been said that no one ever was like him.

Summary: 
Austen was born in an English country retirement in the eighteenth-century.
She was born at a time of a white frost which might have touched her shoes and when a sudden cold was the subject of fears.
There are doubts about the romantic qualities of Austen's work.
Even Scott required elements of hill, mountain, ballad, metaphysics, and German to chip away the classical shell



Summarizing: But in the first place,_ he
_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and
distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,
to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at
the end of the eighteenth century.It is very interesting that we
possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first
draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood.The
formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural.Mr.Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive.In fact, for all the
“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain
side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
its selfishness, receives exhibition.I will not admit that one speech
or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions
are historically true.__But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily
exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.The latter, like
Mr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration.There is,
perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
very faint indeed.Even now I do not think that it would be impossible
to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
as Lady Catherine.A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady
Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
themselves now.As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even
Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him
for the “impropriety” of his conduct.His wife was evidently, and must
always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her
or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but
the ironic.

Summary: 
John Dashwood was like Mr. Collins and was like him, more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops at the end of the eighteenth century.
There is a spoiled first draft of a study of John Dashwood, an unsuccessful study, which is only half alive and feels unnatural.
Mr. Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive.
In the second place, there is



Summarizing: From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,
except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters.It is
difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of
the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,
do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.Let us hope for better things.Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry
to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just
related as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these
pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the
result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s
readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as
they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction
outside of these four.__The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been
already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties
difficult in any space, and impossible in this.Mrs.Bennet we have
glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
amusing or more horribly true.Much the same may be said of Kitty and
Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
weaknesses of woman at such different ages.With Mary, Miss Austen has
taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming
her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of
first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
in that Fordyce-belectured generation.It is at any rate difficult not
to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and
respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.
Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall.

Summary: 
Mr. Collins is a character in Pride and Prejudice who is open to any reproach.
The character of Mr. Collins has a sense of helplessness and helplessness at his wife's elopement.
He offers consolation to his wife when she maunders over the entail and encourages her to hope for better things.
In his conversation with his colossal cousin, Collins questions whether the



Summarizing: I sometimes wish
that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite
these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe
poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail.__The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de
Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though
delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between
comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in
dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in
drab of another.Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet
not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with
a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality.But the
hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed.__Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of
Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,
whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
comparison.It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is
unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
his falling in love at all is not extremely probable.Here again I
cannot go with the objectors.Darcy’s own account of the way in which
his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s
scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous.Nothing in
even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley.Had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
husband-hunting.His being neither is exactly consistent with the
probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love.As for his being in
love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
charm.__The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen
herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather
to be felt than to be explained.Elizabeth of course belongs to the_
allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus.

Summary: 
The characters in the story are Charlotte Lucas, Darcy, Jane, Wickham, Elizabeth, Mr. Bennet, Bingleys, Gardiners, the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss deBourgh.
Charlotte Lucas is described as a delightfully clever study in comedy and farce.
Wickham is depicted as a sketch in drabness.
Darcy is described



Summarizing: Miss Austen was
always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate
sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
about her looks.But her chief difference from other heroines of the
lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost
strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and
secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue.Elizabeth can give
at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
“scratches,” and she never attacks first.Some of the merest
obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early
speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
serious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,
as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the
final ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable.Then
too she is a perfectly natural girl.She does not disguise from herself
or anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with
as personal a feeling.(By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.)And she lets the
injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world.__Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
Darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the
“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)
women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea
that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
her if they can.Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”
she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her.The form of
passion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so
invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
these qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.

Summary: 
Elizabeth Austen is a heroine who is clever, strong-minded, has a sharp tongue, and is not very tall.
Elizabeth has a strong sense of self-confidence and possesses the ability to tease and a sharpness of her tongue.
Unlike other heroines of the type described by Austen, Elizabeth does not show any ill-mannered personality and is entirely self-assured.




Summarizing: But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and
anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’
conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
to the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della
Cruscans of this.__And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
charm?--it is there.There were better sense in the sad mechanic
exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not.In
the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at
least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can
help doing so.Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth
Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara
Grant.I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I
should, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana
and Barbara.But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one
of the four can come into competition with Elizabeth.__GEORGE SAINTSBURY._

Elizabeth would have married Darcy without Pemberley.
The characters in the final chapters of the novel are described as frigid and cold.

[Illustration: ·PRIDE AND PREJUDICE·
Chapter I.]It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?”Mr.Bennet replied that he had not.“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”Mr.Bennet made no answer.“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”[Illustration:“He came down to see the place”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]This was invitation enough.

Summary: 
Lizzy is referred to as Lizzy in the conversation.
Mr. Bennet's aunt discovered the location of Netherfield Park after a short survey.
Netherfield Park is being let.
The park is the property of a woman named Mrs. Long.
Mrs. Long has just been in the area and told Lizzy about the letting of the park.
Lizzy has no



Summarizing: “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.”“What is his name?”“Bingley.”“Is he married or single?”“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure!A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year.What a fine thing for our girls!”“How so?how can it affect them?”“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome?You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”“Is that his design in settling here?”“Design?Nonsense, how can you talk so!But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.”“I see no occasion for that.You and the girls may go--or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
party.”“My dear, you flatter me.I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.”“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”“But consider your daughters.Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them.Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new
comers.Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not.”“You are over scrupulous, surely.I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”“I desire you will do no such thing.Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia.But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”

Summary: 
Netherfield has been taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England named Bingley.
Bingley came to Netherfield on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so delighted with it that he agreed to take possession before Michaelmas and start working there by the end of the week.
The young man is described as a single, single, wealthy individual



Summarizing: “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”“Mr.Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?You take
delight in vexing me.You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”“You mistake me, my dear.I have a high respect for your nerves.They
are my old friends.I have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least.”“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.”“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all.”Mr.Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character._Her_ mind
was less difficult to develope.She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper.When she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous.The business of her life was to get her
daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.}Bennet[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
[Illustration:“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER II.[Illustration]Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it.It was then disclosed in the following
manner.Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,--“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.She has two nieces
of her own.She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her.”“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”

Summary: 
Mr. Bennet views his daughters as silly and ignorant.
Bennet has a high respect for his daughters and considers them his old friends.
Lizzy's mother, Elizabeth, is angry at him for abusing his own children.
Mr. Bingley, who lives in the same neighbourhood as Bennet, is a young man who attracts many young men of four thousand a year to his



Summarizing: Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake!Have a little
compassion on my nerves.You tear them to pieces.”“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully.“When
is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”“To-morrow fortnight.”“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till
the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
she will not know him herself.”“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_.”“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”“I honour your circumspection.A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
very little.One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight.But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I
will take it on myself.”The girls stared at their father.Mrs.Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
nonsense!”“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.“Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense?I cannot quite agree with you _there_.What say you,
Mary?For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books, and make extracts.”Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
Bingley.”“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before?If I
had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on
him.It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.”The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!But I knew I should
persuade you at last.

Summary: 
Mrs. Bennet has a daughter named Kitty who often coughs and often makes her ill.
Kitty's next ball is to be held in a fortnight and she will not meet Mr. Bingley until the day before the ball.
Mr. Bingly suggests that Kitty could introduce him to her despite not knowing him and not being acquainted with him.
Bennet agrees to his wife



Summarizing: I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance.Well, how pleased I am!And it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.”“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
shut.“I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter.At our time of life, it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes we would do anything.Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I’m the tallest.”The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]
[Illustration:     “He rode a black horse”
]
CHAPTER III.[Illustration]Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.They attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas.Her report was highly favourable.Sir William had been
delighted with him.He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party.Nothing could be more delightful!To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library.He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father.

Summary: 
Mr. Bennet is a devoted father to his daughters, Lydia and Kitty.
Lydia is the youngest and is the tallest.
Mr. Bingley is the father of Kitty, Lydia's younger sister.
Kitty made her first acquaintance with Mr.Bennet.
The introduction of Lydia to Mr. Bingly is a joke and a joke about his kindness towards his daughters.




Summarizing: The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.Mr.Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, etc.Mrs.Bennet was quite
disconcerted.She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.Lady Lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his[Illustration:     “When the Party entered”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.The girls grieved over such a
number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,
his five sisters and a cousin.And when the party entered the
assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.Mr.Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion.His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
friend.Mr.Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield.Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.What a contrast between him and his friend!

Summary: 
Mr. Bingley arrived in Hertfordshire and wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.
Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping.
Bingly was obliged to be in town the following day and was unable to accept their invitation to dinner.
The ladies were initially informed that he was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen to the assembly, but



Summarizing: Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.His character was decided.He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
friend to join it.“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance.I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.You had much better
dance.”“I certainly shall not.You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner.At such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable.Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a
kingdom!Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
uncommonly pretty.”“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable.Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”[Illustration:“She is tolerable”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men.You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”Mr.Bingley followed his advice.Mr.Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy danced only with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley during the evening.
He was described as the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world and everyone hoped he would never return to the party again.
Mrs. Bennet, one of the most violent women in the party, was particularly violent against him due to his slighting one of her daughters.



Summarizing: Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party.Mr.Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters.Jane was as much gratified by this as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way.Elizabeth felt Jane’s
pleasure.Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball.They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants.They found Mr. Bennet still up.With a
book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations.He had rather hoped that all his wife’s
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball.I wish you had been there.Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice.Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time.First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance.So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next.Then, the two third he danced with Miss
King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane
again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
“he would not have danced half so much!For God’s sake, say no more of
his partners.O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him.He
is so excessively handsome!and his sisters are charming women.I never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.I dare say the
lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”Here she was interrupted again.Mr.Bennet protested against any
description of finery.She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

Summary: 
Mrs. Bennet has seen her eldest daughter, Jane, being admired by the Netherfield party.
Mr. Bingley had danced with Jane twice and was impressed by her.
Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother, though in a quieter way.
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.
Mary was mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood.




Summarizing: “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing.So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
him!He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great!Not handsome enough to dance with!I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs.I quite detest the man.”
[Illustration]
CHAPTER IV.[Illustration]When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!”“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can.His character is thereby complete.”“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.I
did not expect such a compliment.”“Did not you?_I_ did for you.But that is one great difference between
us.Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.What
could be more natural than his asking you again?He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room.No thanks to his gallantry for that.Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.You have liked many a
stupider person.”“Dear Lizzy!”“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.You never see a fault in anybody.All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes.I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think.”“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others!Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
everywhere.But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad,--belongs to you alone.And so, you like this man’s sisters,
too, do you?Their manners are not equal to his.”“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them.

Summary: 
Lizzy dislikes Mr. Bingley, perceiving him as disagreeable, horrid, high and conceited, and not worth pleasing.
Jane admires him and admires his good manners, good-humoured, lively, and good-looking character.
Lizzy was surprised and flattered by his compliment and his asking her to dance a second time.
Despite her dislike for Mr



Summarizing: Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.”Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
very little disposed to approve them.They were, in fact, very fine
ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others.They were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.Mr.Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it.Mr.Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her.Mr.Bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
look at Netherfield House.He did look at it, and into it, for half an
hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character.Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied.On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.In
understanding, Darcy was the superior.Bingley was by no means
deficient; but Darcy was clever.

Summary: 
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate but didn't live to do it.
Both Bingley and his brother inherited their father's fortune and their own by trade.
They are from a respectable family in the north of England and were raised in one of the first private schools in town and had a fortune



Summarizing: He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting.In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually
giving offence.The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic.Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful.Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure.Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
much.Mrs.Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of.Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER V.
[Illustration]Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate.Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.The
distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly.It had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;
and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about
a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.For,
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to everybody.By nature inoffensive,
friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him
courteous.Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.They had several children.The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth’s intimate friend.That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil
self-command, to Miss Lucas.

Summary: 
Bingley and Darcy are described as haughty, reserved, and well-dressed.
At the Meryton assembly, they were part of a group of people who were kind and attentive.
They both find Miss Bennet, also known as "Charlotte", beautiful and sweet.
Miss Bennet is described by Bingley as sweet and sweet-natured.




Summarizing: “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson.”“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not
I mention it to you?Mr.Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?and his
answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”“Upon my word!Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said
Charlotte.“Mr.Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?Poor Eliza!to be only just _tolerable_.”“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him.Mrs.Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Are you quite sure, ma’am?Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being
spoke to.”“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance.With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.”“I do not believe a word of it, my dear.If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come
to the ball in a hack chaise.”“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
wish he had danced with Eliza.”

Summary: 
Mr. Bingley was initially chosen by Mr. Robinson as his first choice, but decided to choose his second choice, Jane, because he danced with her twice.
Jane believes that Mr. Darcy admired her.
Mr. Robinson asked Darcy about the Meryton assembling and asked him how he liked it and which pretty women he thought were the prettiest.
Mrs.Long told



Summarizing: “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you.”“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it.One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself.If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.”“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe.By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary.Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously.A person may be
proud without being vain.Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his
sisters, “I should not care how proud I was.I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly.”The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would; and the argument ended only with the visit.[Illustration]
[Illustration]
CHAPTER VI.[Illustration]The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.The visit
was returned in due form.Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the
two eldest.By Jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration.

Summary: 
Lizzy's mother refused to dance with him due to his pride.
Miss Lucas believes pride often comes with an excuse for a person to think highly of themselves.
Mary believes pride is a common and common failing among humans.
Elizabeth agrees with Miss Lucas and is willing to forgive Mr. Darcy if his pride does not offend her.
Mrs. Bennet, also known as Mrs. Hur



Summarizing: It
was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent.She mentioned this to her friend, Miss
Lucas.“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded.If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark.There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement.In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_
affection than she feels.Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.If _I_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too.”“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal
it, he must find it out.”“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.But though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together.Jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention.When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chooses.”“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.But
these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design.As yet she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness.She has known him only a fortnight.

Summary: 
Jane and Bingley have known each other for only a fortnight.
Bingley is fond of Jane and admires her greatly.
Jane is in love with Bingley and considers herself to be very much in love.
Despite her feelings for Bingley, she considers it unlikely to be discovered by the general public due to her strength of feeling, composure of temper, and cheerfulness of manner



Summarizing: She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times.This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.”“Not as you represent it.Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.”“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth.Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least.They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.”“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend.Mr.Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.Of
this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.His doing so
drew her notice.It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
assembled.

Summary: 
Jane has danced with Darcy four times at Meryton, seen him one morning at his house, and dined in company with him four times.
Charlotte believes that she has not fully understood Darcy's character despite spending four evenings with him.
Jane believes that Darcy and Vingt know each other better than any other leading characteristic.
Elizabeth is attracted to Darcy from a party



Summarizing: “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?”“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about.He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George
Allen._]]On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,--“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?”“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic.”“You are severe on us.”“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas.“I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody!If my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,
she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is
of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and
I shall keep mine to swell my song.”Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached.Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

Summary: 
Charlotte and Miss Lucas had a conversation with Colonel Forster during which they teased him about plans for a ball at Meryton.
Charlotte is aware of Mr. Darcy's satirical eye and is afraid of him due to his satirical eye.
Miss Lucas has a friend named Eliza who has a talent for music and enjoys playing and singing.
Eliza is a friend of Charlotte



Summarizing: Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas
was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!There is
nothing like dancing, after all.I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies.”“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”Sir William only smiled.“Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.Do
you often dance at St. James’s?”“Never, sir.”“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”“You have a house in town, I conclude?”Mr.Darcy bowed.“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of
superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.”He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,--“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?Mr.Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”Mr.Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain.Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour.”“Mr.Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy and Sir William Lucas are neighbours and share a common interest in dancing.
Sir William considers dancing to be one of the first refinements of polished societies and considers it a form of amusement for young people.
Mr.Darcy has seen Sir William dance at Meryton, but he has never danced at St. James’s.
Elizabeth excels in dancing and has



Summarizing: “He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?”Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.Her resistance had not injured
her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”“I should imagine not.”“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of
your opinion.I was never more annoyed!The insipidity, and yet the
noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
people!What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.My mind was more
agreeably engaged.I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.Mr.Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley.“I am all astonishment.How long has she been such a favourite?and pray when am I to wish you
joy?”“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.A lady’s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment.I knew you would be wishing me joy.”“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled.You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed along.[Illustration:     “A note for Miss Bennet”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER VII.[Illustration]Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his.Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their
father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is attracted to a gentleman named Darcy.
Mr. Darcy is aware of Elizabeth's feelings for him but complaisance about them.
Elizabeth has a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and settled in London.
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton and had left her four thousand pounds and



Summarizing: The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
to a milliner’s shop just over the way.The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
some from their aunt.At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was
the head-quarters.Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence.Every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers’ names and connections.Their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves.Mr.Philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before.They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed,--“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country.I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced.”Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly.If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother.When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do.

Summary: 
The village of Longbourn is only one mile from Meryton, which is convenient for young ladies who visit their aunt who owns a milliner's shop.
Catherine and Lydia, the two youngest daughters of the family, are frequent visitors to their aunt's shop and often walk there for entertainment and conversation.
The young ladies often learn from their aunt about the recent arrival of a militia



Summarizing: I remember the time when I
liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in
his regimentals.”“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”Mrs.Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer.Mrs.Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--“Well, Jane, who is it from?What is it about?What does he say?Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud./* NIND “My dear friend, */     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
     end without a quarrel.Come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this.My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.Yours ever,“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.”“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.”“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.”“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”“I had much rather go in the coach.”“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”

Summary: 
Lydia's aunt informs Lydia about the change in their visits to Miss Watson's library.
Colonel Forster and Captain Carter are known to visit Miss Watson’s library and are often seen there.
Mrs. Bennet has a fondness for a red coat.
Lydia received a note from a footman from Netherfield, addressed to Caroline Bingley, who is a close



Summarizing: “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
will be answered.”She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day.Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard.Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted.The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.Till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance.Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:--     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.My kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till I am better.They insist also on
     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a
     headache, there is not much the matter with me.“Yours, etc.”“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying.People do not die of little
trifling colds.She will be taken good care of.As long as she stays
there, it is all very well.I would go and see her if I could have the
carriage.”Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
her only alternative.She declared her resolution.“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt!You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.”“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
horses?”“No, indeed.I do not wish to avoid the walk.The distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles.I shall be back by dinner.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth's mother, Mrs. Bennet, predicted a bad day for Jane.
Jane was forced to go on horseback due to the engagement of the horses.
It was raining heavily that day, making it difficult for Jane to return home.
The servants from Netherfield brought a note to Elizabeth from Jane, who was feeling unwell and blamed her illness on getting wet through the rain the previous day



Summarizing: “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it.She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was
good-humour and kindness.Mr.Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst
nothing at all.The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
enough to leave her room.Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.She was not equal,
however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with.Elizabeth silently attended
her.When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane.The apothecary came; and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely.

Summary: 
Elizabeth walked three miles alone in dirty weather to reach the officers’ wives’ house in Meryton.
There, she was met by Catherine, Lydia, and Miss Bingley.
Elizabeth walked into the officers' wives' breakfast parlour where all but Jane were present.
Miss Bingley advised Elizabeth to return to bed and promised her some draughts for her feverish symptoms



Summarizing: Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so.Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present.Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.[Illustration:“The Apothecary came”

[Illustration:“covering a screen”

CHAPTER VIII.[Illustration]At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very
favourable answer.Jane was by no means better.The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency.His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others.She had very little notice from any but him.Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.Mrs.Hurst
thought the same, and added,--“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker.I shall never forget her appearance this morning.She really
looked almost wild.”“She did indeed, Louisa.I could hardly keep my countenance.Very
nonsensical to come at all!Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold?Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”

Summary: 
Elizabeth was invited to Netherfield by Miss Bingley for a present.
Elizabeth agreed to stay at Netherfield and was sent to Longbourn by a servant to inform the family about her stay and bring a supply of clothes from the Apothecary.
During her stay, Elizabeth was summoned to the civil inquiries which were taking place and was not pleased with the superior solicitude of Mr. Bing



Summarizing: “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
all lost upon me.I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well
when she came into the room this morning.Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.”“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition.”“Certainly not.”“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!what could she mean by
it?It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.”“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
Bingley.“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,
“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.”“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet
girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.But with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no
chance of it.”“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton?”“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.”“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend’s vulgar relations.With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself.

Summary: 
Elizabeth walked three miles, possibly four miles, alone, above her ancles in dirt and mud.
Elizabeth's petticoat was six inches deep in mud and her gown was not doing its job.
Miss Bingley believes that Elizabeth's adventure shows an abominable sort of conceited independence, a country-town indifference to decorum, and affection for her sister, Jane Bennet.




Summarizing: On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
below, with a book.Mr.Hurst looked at her with astonishment.“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards.She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I
am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying.He immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.”Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
so small a collection of books.What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many
generations.”“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying
books.”“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.”“Neglect!I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place.Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley.”“I wish it may.”“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire.”“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is the sister of Miss Eliza Bennet, who is a greatreader.
Elizabeth finds the party at the drawing-room and declines the invitation to join them, preferring to stay below and read.
Mr.Hurst is surprised by Elizabeth's preference for reading to cards.
Miss Bingley, Elizabeth's sister, has a great dislike of cards and has no pleasure in anything else.




Summarizing: “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will
she be as tall as I am?”“I think she will.She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”“How I long to see her again!I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much.Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
for her age!Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.”“All young ladies accomplished!My dear Charles, what do you mean?”“Yes, all of them, I think.They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses.I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am
sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was very accomplished.”“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
too much truth.The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished.”“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.”“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with.A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.”“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add
something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
reading.”“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?”“_I_ never saw such a woman._I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”

Summary: 
Miss Darcy has grown and is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height.
Miss Bingley and Miss Darcy have known each other since the spring.
Bingley and Darcy are fond of each other, with Bingley describing her as extremely accomplished and admiring her performance on the pianoforte.
Darcy believes that all young ladies are accomplished, including those who paint tables,



Summarizing: Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation.Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her.Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians.This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better.Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable.They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.[Illustration:M^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER IX.[Illustration]Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters.In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation.The note was immediately despatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with.Mrs.Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.

Summary: 
Eliza Bennet is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their worthiness, according to Miss Bingley.
Mr. Bingley and Mrs. Hurst are critical of Eliza's actions, accusing her of being a member of such a group.
Eliza's illness has left her feeling worse and she is unable to leave her.



Summarizing: She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable.After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour.Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.“She is a great deal too ill to be
moved.Mr.Jones says we must not think of moving her.We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.”“Removed!” cried Bingley.“It must not be thought of.My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal.”“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.”Mrs.Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I ever met with.I often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_.You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk.I do not know a place in the country that is
equal to Netherfield.You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
hope, though you have but a short lease.”“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes.At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”“That is as it happens.It does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were
a studier of character.It must be an amusing study.”“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.

Summary: 
The apothecary, the mother, three daughters, and Mr. Bingley visited Miss Bennet in the breakfast parlour.
Miss Bennet is ill and is too ill to be moved.
Mrs. Bennet's sister, who is also a good friend of Bingley, will not agree to her removal.
Despite her illness, Miss Bingley has a sweet room in Netherfield



Summarizing: They have at
least that advantage.”“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study.In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.”“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood.“I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.”Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away.Mrs.Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph,--“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places.The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and
when I am in town, it is pretty much the same.They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition.But that
gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother.“You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true.”“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger.I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance.His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.“Yes, she called yesterday with her father.What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he?so much the man of fashion!so
genteel and so easy!He has always something to say to everybody._That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”“Did Charlotte dine with you?”“No, she would go home.I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.

Summary: 
Charlotte Lucas has been at Longbourn since her coming away.
Charlotte called her father, Sir William, to request mince-pies.
Bennet believes that London has an advantage over the country due to shops and public places.
Mr. Darcy believes that the country offers many subjects for study and that in a country neighbourhood you move in a confined and predictable society.




Summarizing: For
my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I
assure you.It is a pity they are not handsome!Not that _I_ think
Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty.I do not like to boast
of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking.It is what everybody says.I do not trust my own
partiality.When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.But, however, he did not.Perhaps he thought her too young.However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently.“There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.Everything nourishes what is
strong already.But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.Mr.Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required.She performed her part,
indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage.Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward.The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age.

Summary: 
Mr. Bingley keeps servants who can do their own work.
Charlotte is a friend of his family and is described as very plain.
Bingley's sister-in-law, Lady Lucas, has often envied Jane's beauty.
When Charlotte was only 15 years old, a gentleman at his brother's in town was in love with Charlotte and wrote some verses on her.




Summarizing: She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.She was
very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the
ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.His answer
to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball.But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”Lydia declared herself satisfied.“Oh yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again.And when you have given _your_ ball,” she
added, “I shall insist on their giving one also.I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”Mrs.Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.[Illustration]
CHAPTER X.[Illustration]The day passed much as the day before had done.Mrs.Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room.The loo table, however, did not appear.Mr.Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister.Mr.Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.The perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”He made no answer.“You write uncommonly fast.”“You are mistaken.I write rather slowly.”“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year!Letters of business, too!How odious I should think them!”

Summary: 
Lydia is engaged to Mr. Bingley and has made a promise to him to keep their engagement to a ball when her sister is well.
They are planning to wait until Jane is well and Captain Carter arrives at Meryton for the ball.
Mrs. Bennet, her daughters, and Miss Bingley are present at the ball and Lydia suggests they wait for Captain Carter.
Mr.



Summarizing: “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”“I am afraid you do not like your pen.Let me mend it for you.I mend
pens remarkably well.”“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”“How can you contrive to write so even?”He was silent.“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley’s.”“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?At
present I have not room to do them justice.”“Oh, it is of no consequence.I shall see her in January.But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine.”“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill.”“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease.He studies too much
for words of four syllables.Do not you, Darcy?”“My style of writing is very different from yours.”“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable.He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
humility.It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting.The power of doing anything with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance.

Summary: 
Darcy and Elizabeth are siblings.
Darcy has a penmanship skill and is known to mend his own pens.
Elizabeth suggests that Darcy should give her leave to defer his raptures until he can write a letter to Caroline.
Charles, Caroline's brother, criticizes Darcy's style of writing, stating that he studies too much for words of four syllables and leaves out half



Summarizing: When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning.And yet, upon my honour, I
believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment.At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity.Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay
till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition.You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for
himself.”“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged.Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.”“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.”“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection.

Summary: 
Bingo has told Mrs. Bennet that he intends to leave Netherfield.
Bingo's friend, a man named Mr. Darcy, has expressed his desire for Bingley to stay at Netherfield for a month or more.
Elizabeth believes that Bingley's intention was intended to be a compliment to himself and not to show off before the ladies.
Despite his initial intention to leave



Summarizing: A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it.I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley.We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon.But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.I assure
you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.”Mr.Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend.“You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.”“Perhaps I do.Arguments are too much like disputes.If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.”Mr.Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music.Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to
the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the
way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.Mrs.Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed
on her.She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley are friends and have a mutual respect for each other.
Mr. Bingley has a preference for granting requests without waiting for arguments.
Miss Bingley believes that if Mr Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, she would not pay him as much deference due to his dislike for her.
During their conversation, Mr. Bennet applied for the



Summarizing: She could only imagine, however,
at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present.The supposition did not pain her.She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a
lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her,--“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”She smiled, but made no answer.He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply.You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt.I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
dare.”“Indeed I do not dare.”Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.He really
believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
the officers.And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”[Illustration:     “No, no; stay where you are”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”“Oh yes.Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley.Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge.They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is attracted to Mr. Darcy because she believes there is something about her that is more wrong and reprehensible than any other person present.
Despite her feelings for Darcy, Elizabeth does not like him and does not care for his approbation.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley added a lively Scotch air to her charm, which attracted Darcy's attention.
Elizabeth initially



Summarizing: As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
telling us that you were coming out.”Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself.The path just admitted three.Mr.Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said,--“This walk is not wide enough for our party.We had better go into the
avenue.”But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,--“No, no; stay where you are.You are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon advantage.The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth.Good-bye.”She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two.Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.[Illustration:     “Piling up the fire”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XI.[Illustration]When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.Their powers
of conversation were considerable.They could describe an entertainment
with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
acquaintance with spirit.But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.He addressed
himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation.He was full of joy and
attention.The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
door.He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy intended to take a picture of Elizabeth's eyes.
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley were unaware that Elizabeth intended to walk away without informing them.
The path they were walking down was not wide enough for their party, so they decided to go into theavenue.
Elizabeth advised them to stay where they were because the picturesque view would be spoilt by admitting



Summarizing: When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain.She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected.She assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.Mr.Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep.Darcy took up a book.Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss
Bennet.Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question and read on.At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way!I declare, after all, there is no
enjoyment like reading!How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book!When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library.”No one made any reply.She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,--“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield?I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.”“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send
round my cards.”“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day.”“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be
near so much like a ball.”Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room.

Summary: 
Mr. Hurst tried to convince his sister-in-law, Miss Bingley, to set up a card-table but was unsuccessful.
Miss Bingley had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish to play cards.
Hurst decided to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
Darcy and Mrs. Bingley took up books and engaged in



Summarizing: Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.In the
desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to Elizabeth, said,--“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room.I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.”Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked
up.He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere.What could he mean?She was dying to know what could be his
meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it.”Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak.“You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be
completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire.”“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley.“I never heard anything so
abominable.How shall we punish him for such a speech?”“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth.“We
can all plague and punish one another.Tease him--laugh at him.Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”“But upon my honour I do _not_.I do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_.Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind!No,
no; I feel he may defy us there.And as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.Mr.Darcy may hug himself.”“Mr.Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth.“That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.

Summary: 
Eliza Bennet and Elizabeth are in a room with Mr. Darcy.
Elizabeth is elegant and elegant, but Darcy is still inflexibly studious.
Miss Bingley suggests to Elizabeth to follow her example and take a turn about the room, which Elizabeth finds refreshing after long periods of sitting in one attitude.
Darcy declines the invitation to join their party and suggests two possible motives for



Summarizing: I dearly love a
laugh.”“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be.The
wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may
be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.”“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am
not one of _them_.I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.Follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I
laugh at them whenever I can.But these, I suppose, are precisely what
you are without.”“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone.But it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.”“Such as vanity and pride.”“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
“and pray what is the result?”“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.He owns it
himself without disguise.”“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension.I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding.My temper I dare not vouch
for.It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
convenience of the world.I cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself.My
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.My temper
would perhaps be called resentful.My good opinion once lost is lost for
ever.”“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth.“Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character.But you have chosen your fault well.I
really cannot _laugh_ at it.You are safe from me.”“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand
them.”“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share.“Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst.”Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
it.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy has a fondness for laughter and considers it his first object in life.
Elizabeth has studied her life to avoid weaknesses that expose her to ridicule and vanity.
Darcy has admitted to having faults, including a temper that is temperamental and a propensity to hate everyone.
Miss Bingley woke Mr. Hurst to have a conversation with Darcy.
Louisa, her



Summarizing: He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XII.[Illustration]In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day.But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before.Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home.Mrs.Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well.Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough.She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself.He
wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it.Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place.Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Jane were planning to stay at Netherfield until the following Tuesday.
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, planned to send a carriage to Netherfield to pick up her daughters.
The plan to leave Netherfield was delayed due to Miss Bingley's jealousy and dislike of one of her sisters.
Mr. Darcy, the master of the house, tried to persuade Miss Bennet that



Summarizing: Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.Mrs.Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to.Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort.Much had been done, and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XIII
[Illustration]“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”“Who do you mean, my dear?I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her.I do not believe she often sees such at home.”“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”Mrs.Bennet’s eyes sparkled.“A gentleman and a stranger!It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure.Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly
thing!Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.But--good Lord!how unlucky!there is not a bit of fish to be got
to-day.Lydia, my love, ring the bell.I must speak to Hill this
moment.”“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.”This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a
fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,
and requiring early attention.It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,
when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
pleases.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Jane were not welcomed home warmly by their mother.
Their father was happy to see them and felt their importance in the family circle.
They found Mary, who was deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature.
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.
In the regiment, several officers had dined with their uncle, a private had been flogged



Summarizing: “Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.Pray do not talk of that odious man.I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.”Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.”“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.I hate such false
friends.Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?”“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.”     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_.*/“Dear Sir,     “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the
     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the
     breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,
     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
     at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now
     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,
     I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
     the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis
     de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
     Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
     which are instituted by the Church of England.

Summary: 
Bennet is deeply disturbed by the idea of her family's estate being taken away from them by a man she perceives as odious.
Mr. Bennet and his wife, Jane, are discussing an entail, which involves the inheritance of an estate away from their own children.
Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain the nature of an entail to their wife, but she was beyond the reach



Summarizing: As a clergyman,
     moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
     these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of
     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
     being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly
     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
     olive branch.I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter.If you should
     have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself
     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,
     November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your
     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do
     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting
     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other
     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.I remain, dear sir,
     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
     well-wisher and friend,“WILLIAM COLLINS.”“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.“He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.”“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.”Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.“I cannot make him out.There
is something very pompous in his style.And what can he mean by
apologizing for being next in the entail?We cannot suppose he would
help it, if he could.Can he be a sensible man, sir?”“No, my dear; I think not.I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse.

Summarizing: There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well.I am impatient to see him.”“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem
defective.The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.”To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting.It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.As for
their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.Mr.Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family.Mr.Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.He was a tall,
heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal.He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.Things are settled so
oddly.”“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”“Ah, sir, I do indeed.It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess.Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
I know, are all chance in this world.There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.”“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate.But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them.At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted----”He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other.They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration.

Summary: 
The character of the letter is described as servility and self-importance by Mary.
Catherine and Lydia find the letter and its writer to be well-written and well expressed.
Mr. Collins is a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty, his air is grave and his manners are formal.
He was punctual to his time and was received with



Summarizing: The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property.The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
cookery was owing.But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured
him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.He begged
pardon for having displeased her.In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
quarter of an hour.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XIV
[Illustration]During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.Lady
Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable.Mr.Bennet could not have chosen
better.Mr.Collins was eloquent in her praise.The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine.She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her.She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening.Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations.She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I
dare say she is a very agreeable woman.It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her.Does she live near you, sir?”“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”

Summary: 
Mr. Bennet has a hall, dining-room, and all its furniture.
He initially feared that he might view the hall and dinner as his own future property.
Mrs. Collins, his cousin, assured him that the Bennets are very well-off and could afford a good cook.
During the meal, Mr. Bennets apologized to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh,



Summarizing: “I think you said she was a widow, sir?has she any family?”“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.”“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
many girls.And what sort of young lady is she?Is she handsome?”“She is a most charming young lady, indeed.Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth.She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them.But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”“Has she been presented?I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived
the British Court of its brightest ornament.Her Ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies.I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her.These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.”“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?”“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”Mr.Bennet’s expectations were fully answered.His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
glad to invite him[Illustration:

Summary: 
The heiress of Rosings, Miss de Bourgh, is the daughter of a wealthy family and has a fortune.
She is described as a charming and charming young lady, but has a sickly constitution which has prevented her from making progress in her education and many opportunities.
Despite her poor health, Miss De Bourgh is popular among the ladies at the court.

that he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94
]to read aloud to the ladies.Mr.Collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels.Kitty stared at him, and Lydia
exclaimed.Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,--“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away
Richard?and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday.I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.It amazes
me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction.But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon.Mr.Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.Mrs.Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XV.[Illustration]Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance.The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity.

Summary: 
Lydia informed her aunt that her uncle Philips talked about turning away Richard if Colonel Forster hires him.
Lydia plans to walk to Meryton to hear more about it and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.
Mr. Collins agreed to read a book from a circulating library to Kitty and Lydia.
After reading "Fordyce’s Sermons", Lydia



Summarizing: A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.His plan did not vary on seeing them.Miss Bennet’s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice.The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.“As to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”Mr.Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.Mrs.Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.

Summary: 
Mr. Bennet was recommended by Lady Catherine deBourgh to take the living of Hunsford.
He is a clergyman and a rector with a high respect and reverence for his patroness, and a good opinion of himself, his authority as a clergyperson, and his right as an aclergyman.
Mr Bennet intends to marry and seek a reconciliation with the



Summarizing: In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.Their eyes
were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way.The officer was the very
Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed.All were struck with the stranger’s air, all
wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible
to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
spot.Mr.Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in
their corps.This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming.His appearance was
greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.The introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were
seen riding down the street.On distinguishing the ladies of the group
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities.Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the
principal object.He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her.Mr.Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red.

Summary: 
Mr. Collins has always been comfortable in his library and was used to being free from folly and conceit in his house.
Elizabeth, his daughter, invited Mr. Collins to join her and her daughters for a walk through Meryton.
They met Mr. Denny, an officer who had returned from London and accepted a commission in their corps.
Lydia, Kitty, and Lydia



Summarizing: Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.What could be the meaning of it?It was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.Mr.Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.
Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.Mrs.Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,
because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him.She received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice.Mrs.Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had
brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s
commission in the ----shire.She had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham
appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening.This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.Mr.

Summary: 
Mr. Wickham touched Mr. Darcy's hat and made a salutation.
Mr. Bingley took leave and rode away with his friend, Mr. Denny.
Mrs. Philips was happy to see her nieces, especially the two eldest, Kitty and Lydia, who had recently returned home from their recent absence.
The two girls from Longbourn visited Mr. Philips's house



Summarizing: Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.

Summary: 
Collins made unnecessary apologies in leaving the room.
Collins expressed his apologies with unwearying civility and assured his audience that his apologies were perfectly justified.
The apology Collins made in the room was made with an unwearied civility, as indicated by his behavior after leaving.
In his apology, Collins expressed his apology with a degree of unweariness, indicating that he was not accustomed



Summarizing: As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.Mr.Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.
Philips’s manners and politeness.He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before.Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVI.[Illustration]As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
the house.When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper’s room.In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could.To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long.It was over at last, however.The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Jane are sisters.
They have a sister named Elizabeth who has a close relationship with her sister, Jane.
Mr. Collins, a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, visited Meryton with his five cousins and was impressed by their aunt, Lady Catherine, and his cousin, Mr. Wickham, who accepted their uncle's invitation to the house.
Mrs.



Summarizing: The
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.[Illustration:“The officers of the ----shire”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin.When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,
in return, by sitting down to whist.“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to
improve myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very
thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.Mr.Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.At first there
seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.She dared not even
mention that gentleman.Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved.Mr.Wickham began the subject himself.He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.”“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.A clear ten
thousand per annum.

Summary: 
The officers of the ----shire were present at the party.
Mr. Wickham and the officers are superior to the uncle Philips, who followed them into the room.
Mrs. Philips provided coffee and muffin to Wickham, along with a card table for the game of whist.
The card tables were placed at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.
Lydia is fond of lottery tickets.




Summarizing: You could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been
connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”Elizabeth could not but look surprised.“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday.Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly.“I have spent
four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.”“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise.I am not qualified to form one.I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge.It is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial.But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else.Here you are in your own family.”“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except Netherfield.He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire.Everybody is disgusted with his pride.You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.”Wickham only shook his head.“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield.I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go.We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.

Summary: 
Elizabeth has been connected with Mr. Darcy's family since her infancy.
Elizabeth has spent four days in the same house with him and considers him disagreeable.
Wickham is not qualified to form an opinion on Mr Darcy because he has known him for too long and knows him too well.
He believes that Mr.Darcy is disliked in Hertfordshire due to his high



Summarizing: His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be
in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections.His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.”Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.Mr.Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.I know it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.Society, I own, is necessary to me.I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude.I _must_ have employment and society.A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible.The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.”“Indeed!”“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift.He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.I cannot do justice to his kindness.He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.”“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be?How could his
will be disregarded?Why did not you seek legal redress?”“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law.A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it.

Summary: 
Mr. Wickham considers his father, Mr. Darcy, to be one of the best men he has known and a true friend.
Elizabeth is deeply affected by the memory of her father, Miss Bennet, and has deep affection for him.
Mr.Darcy has been described by Elizabeth as a man of honor and a friend of hers, but she considers his behaviour to be scandal



Summarizing: I have a warm unguarded temper, and I
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely.I can recall nothing worse.But the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me.”“This is quite shocking!He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy.Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.”“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!”After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.His disposition
must be dreadful.”“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can
hardly be just to him.”Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself
with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest
manner.”“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care._My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,
appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property.

Summary: 
Elizabeth has a warm, unguarded temper and often speaks freely to Mr. Darcy, expressing her opinion freely.
Elizabeth believes that Darcy dislikes her due to jealousy.
Wickham and Elizabeth were born in the same parish, within the same park, and their youth was passed together, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.
They have known each



Summarizing: He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend.Mr.Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;
and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”“How strange!” cried Elizabeth.“How abominable!I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you.If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty I must call it.”“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be
traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend.It has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.But we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.”“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor.Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his
father was, have done this.Not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.”“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”He shook his head.“I wish I could call her amiable.It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
proud.As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.But she is
nothing to me now.She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished.Since her father’s death her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.”After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley.How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man?How can they suit each other?Do you
know Mr. Bingley?”“Not at all.”

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy is a close friend of Mr. Bingley and has a close relationship with him.
Darcy owes his life to his father's active superintendence.
After Darcy's father's death, Darcy promised to provide for his daughter.
Wickham believes that pride is a strong motivator behind Darcy’s actions.
Elizabeth is surprised and disturbed by



Summarizing: “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is.”“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.He does not
want abilities.He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while.Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.His pride
never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.”The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.The usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter.It had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.There
are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.”Mr.Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations
were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a
living.I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”“No, indeed, I did not.I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s
connections.I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.”“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley.Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.“Mr.

Summary: 
Elizabeth describes Mr. Darcy as sweet-tempered, amiable, charming, and charming.
Mr. Collins is a cousin of Mr.Darcy and has lost money at a whist party.
Mrs. Philips expressed concern about Mr. Collins' success at the whist party but he dismissed the money as a mere trifle.
Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the aunt of Lady Anne Dar



Summarizing: Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her
Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have
not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class.”Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham’s attentions.There could be no conversation in the noise of
Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody.Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully.Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.[Illustration:     “delighted to see their dear friend again”
]
CHAPTER XVII.[Illustration]Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself.Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.The
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea.

Summary: 
Wickham has not seen Lady Catherine for many years and perceives her as arrogant, conceited, and conceited.
Elizabeth believes Lady Catherine and her daughter, Lady Catherine, to be arrogant.
Lydia and Mr. Wickham were at a supper party at Mrs. Philips’s where they played cards and enjoyed each other's company.
Lady Catherine has a reputation for being



Summarizing: Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other.It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.”“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business?Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.”“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion.My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a
manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for.It is
impossible.No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it.Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him?Oh no.”“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that
Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last
night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.If it be not
so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.Besides, there was truth in his looks.”“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing.One does not know what to
think.”“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.
Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when
the affair became public.The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was
fixed for the following Tuesday.The two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation.To the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others.They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family.Mrs.Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card.

Summary: 
Lizzy and Jane are discussing a possible misunderstanding or miscommunication in a business relationship.
They are discussing the possibility that interest groups have misrepresented each other.
Lizzy believes that Mr. Darcy is treating his father's favourite, Bingley, in a disgraceful manner.
Jane suggests that the interest groups involved in the business have to clear up their misgivings or face the consequences.



Summarizing: Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look
and behaviour.The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball.And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough.I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.”Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,
either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.She had fully proposed being
engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed.There was no help
for it, however.Mr.Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could.She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.

Summary: 
Catherine and Lydia are planning a happy evening in the society of their friends and the attentions of their brother, Mr. Darcy.
Elizabeth and Jane are planning to spend the evening at a ball with the intention to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham.
Mary is open to the idea of attending the ball and expressed no disinclination for it.
Mr. Collins accepted Mr



Summarizing: The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply.Mr.Collins might never make the offer, and,
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;
for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.No
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses
for Netherfield were got by proxy.Even Elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement
of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on
Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday
endurable to Kitty and Lydia.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVIII.[Illustration]Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.The certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her.She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening.But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s
pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,--“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is attracted to Mr. Wickham due to her wit, vivacity, and charm.
Elizabeth's mother hinted about the possibility of their marriage.
Mr. Collins might never make an offer to marry Elizabeth.
There was a Netherfield ball at which they were invited, but the weather prevented them from walking to Meryton due to rain.
Wickham was not present at the



Summarizing: Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she
had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary
transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
particular notice.The two first dances, however, brought a return of
distress: they were dances of mortification.Mr.Collins, awkward and
solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.The moment of her
release from him was ecstasy.She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him.He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind: Charlotte tried to console her.“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”“Heaven forbid!_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!Do not wish me such an
evil.”When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man often times his consequence.Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
she made some slight observation on the dance.He replied, and was again
silent.After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,
with--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy._I_ talked about the
dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
room, or the number of couples.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth is attracted to Wickham, her cousin, and dislikes him.
Wickham is disliked by Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her anger.
Elizabeth danced with Mr. Collins, who was awkward and unresponsive, causing her embarrassment and misery.
After the first dance, Elizabeth danced with an officer and enjoyed talking about Wickham and hearing that he was universally liked.



Summarizing: He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.“Very well; that reply will do for the present.Perhaps, by-and-by, I
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
_now_ we may be silent.”“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”“Sometimes.One must speak a little, you know.It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.”“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?”“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds.We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”
said he.“How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say._You_
think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”“I must not decide on my own performance.”He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton.She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.”The effect was immediate.A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on.At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,--“Mr.Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain.”“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,
with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.”Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.At
that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
superior dancing is not often seen.It is evident that you belong to the
first circles.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Darcy are engaged in a conversation at a private ball.
Darcy suggests that private balls can be pleasanter than public ones.
Elizabeth asks Darcy if he talks by rule while he's dancing.
Both Darcy and Elizabeth are unsocial, untactful, and of an unsocial disposition.
During the dance, Elizabeth compliments Darcy on his dancing and his partner.




Summarizing: Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing
at her sister and Bingley), shall take place.What congratulations will
then flow in!I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”[Illustration:“Such very superior dancing is not
often seen.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together.Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,--“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking
of.”“I do not think we were speaking at all.Sir William could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves.We have tried two or three subjects already without success,
and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.”“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject.We may compare our different opinions.”“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
with a look of doubt.“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
unappeasable.You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_?”“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”“I hope not.”“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.”“May I ask to what these questions tend?”“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity.“I am trying to make it out.”“And what is your success?”She shook her head.“I do not get on at all.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy and Miss Eliza are engaged in a romantic relationship.
Eliza has a close relationship with Bingley and Jane, who are dancing together.
Sir William, Eliza's partner, was surprised by their superior dancing skills.
They have tried different subjects in the past, including books, but have yet to find a common subject for conversation.
Jane is not fond of books



Summarizing: I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.”“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,
with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.
Darcy’s steward.Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using
him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always
remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a
most infamous manner.I do not know the particulars, but I know very
well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear
to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and
I wonder how he could presume to do it.I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this
discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his
descent, one could not expect much better.”“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”
said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.”“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.“You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.

Summary: 
Darcy is aware of the varying accounts of him and fears that his performance could reflect poorly on both himself and Bennet.
Elizabeth is concerned about her character and wants to preserve her likeness for the future.
George Wickham is the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward.
Eliza's sister has been talking to Darcy's sister about George Wick



Summarizing: I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.”“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you.Mr.Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.I am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s
regard.”“Mr.Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.I am
perfectly satisfied.But what does he say of the living?”“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.”“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,
“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.Mr.Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as I did before.”She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment.Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of
Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it.

Summary: 
Elizabeth has a strong dislike for Mr. Darcy and believes him to be guilty of wilful ignorance and malice.
Jane has not forgotten about Mr. Wickham.
Bingley vouches for the good conduct, probity and honour of his friend, Mr.



Summarizing: On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate
as to make a most important discovery.“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation to my patroness.I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,
Lady Catherine.How wonderfully these sort of things occur!Who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly!I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”“Indeed I am.I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_.It will be in my power to
assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance.Mr.Collins listened to her with
the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
speaking, replied thus,--“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained.You must, therefore, allow me to follow the
dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform
what I look on as a point of duty.Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education
and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Bingley are in an assembly where they are joined by Miss Lucas.
Mr. Collins has just made an important discovery which involves a near relation to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
Elizabeth was unaware of the connection until she overheard Mr. Collins mentioning the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh and her mother Lady Catherine to the young lady who does the hon



Summarizing: Her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”
“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man.Mr.Darcy was eyeing him with
unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,
replied with an air of distant civility.Mr.Collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
reception.Mr.Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.It was really a very
handsome thought.Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.She saw her in idea settled in that
very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like Bingley’s two sisters.Her mother’s thoughts she plainly
saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
lest she might hear too much.When they sat down to supper, therefore,
she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.
Bingley.It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable
of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.His being such
a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be
certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are cousins and have a close relationship.
Elizabeth was deeply affected by the conversation between Darcy and Collins.
Darcy was initially reluctant to engage in conversation with Mr. Collins but eventually allowed him to do so.
Despite his initial reluctance, Darcy eventually allowed Collins to express his contempt towards him.
Lady Catherine de Bourgh was praised by Darcy for



Summarizing: It
was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.It was necessary
to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such
occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower.What advantage can it be to you
to offend Mr. Darcy?You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.”Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation.She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.Elizabeth now began to revive.But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company.By many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.

Summary: 
Elizabeth's mother, Mrs. Bennet, considers staying at home due to the etiquette.
Elizabeth's younger sister, Lady Lucas, is also a single mother and is expected to take care of her younger daughters.
Jane is marrying a rich man, which Elizabeth's mother believes will put her daughters in the way of other rich men.
The conversation between Elizabeth and her mother was overheard by Mr.



Summarizing: Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another.Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected.Elizabeth was in agonies.She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly
talking to Bingley.She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
impenetrably grave.She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.He took the hint,
and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--“That will do extremely well, child.You have delighted us long enough.Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good.Others of the party were now applied to.“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman.I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.The
rector of a parish has much to do.In the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron.He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible.And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.I
cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who
should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded
his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
room.Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.
Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for
having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady
Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

Summary: 
Elizabeth was deeply affected by Mary's performance, which left her distressed and anxious.
Mary's performance left Elizabeth feeling distressed.
Mr. Collins, the father of Mary, expressed his approval of her performance and encouraged her to continue singing.
Bennet and his wife commended Mr. Collins for having spoken sensibly.
Elizabeth looked to Jane, Bingley, and Darcy for support



Summarizing: To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed.That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others.In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
room.He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent
to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining
close to her the whole evening.There was no arguing upon such a
project.She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who
often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation
to herself.She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family.Mrs.Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.Darcy said
nothing at all.Mr.Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.Mr.Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and her family had an agreement to expose themselves during the evening.
Elizabeth was disappointed by the behaviour of Mr. Darcy and his family, especially his sisters and Mr. Bennet.
She was teased by Mr. Collins, who stayed close to her throughout the night.
Miss Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, often joined them and engaged Mr.Collins in conversation.
Bingley



Summarizing: Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation.Bingley was all grateful
pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.Mrs.Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months.Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.[Illustration:     “to assure you in the most animated language”
]
CHAPTER XIX.[Illustration]The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.Mr.Collins made his
declaration in form.Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.On finding
Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?”Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet instantly answered,--“Oh dear!Yes, certainly.I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure
she can have no objection.Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth
called out,--“Dear ma’am, do not go.I beg you will not go.Mr.Collins must excuse
me.He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.I am
going away myself.”“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.

Summary: 
Elizabeth, Lydia, and Mrs. Bennet are the least emotionally active members of the family.
Lydia is too tired to utter more than occasional exclamation of "Lord, Lord, how tired I am!" when they take leave from Longbourn.
Elizabeth expresses hope of seeing the family at Netherfield and hopes to have a family dinner with Mr. Bingley after his return from London.




Summarizing: I desire you will stay where you are.” And
upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
Mr. Collins.”Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion.Mrs.Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected
mother’s permission for this address.You can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.Almost as
soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my
future life.But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued,--“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to
have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness.Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!)on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr.Collins, you
must marry.A clergyman like you must marry.Choose properly, choose a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way.This is my advice.

Summary: 
Bennet and Kitty walked off, leaving Elizabeth alone with Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth expressed her desire for Mr.Collins to stay and listen to her.
Mr. Collins has come to Hertfordshire with the intention of selecting a wife.
He has the permission of his mother's permission for this address.
Mrs. Jenkinson, also known as Miss De Bourgh's footst



Summarizing: Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and
kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer.You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite.Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
assure you there are many amiable young women.But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be
for several years.This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection.To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.“You forget that I have made no
answer.Let me do it without further loss of time.Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me.I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them.”“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time.I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have
just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is interested in finding a wife for her cousin, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who lives in Hunsford.
Elizabeth is seeking a wife from among Lady Catherine's daughters.
Lady Catherine is known for her kindness, wit, and vivacity.
She is planning to inherit an estate after the death of her father, which is expected to take place in several years' time.
Mr



Summarizing: I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time.I am perfectly serious in my refusal.You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so.Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.”“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,
very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all
disapprove of you.And you may be certain that when I have the honour of
seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications.”“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what I say.I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus
addressed her,--“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.”“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly.If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one.”“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses are merely words of course.My reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable.My situation in life, my connections
with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.

Summary: 
Elizabeth believes she is the only woman who can make Mr. Collins happy.
Despite her strong connections with the De Bourgh family, Elizabeth is not willing to risk her happiness for a second time for marriage.
If Lady Catherine were to know Elizabeth, she would find her illqualified for the position.
Mr. Collins believes that Lady Catherine would find Elizabeth illqualified but he cannot imagine her disapproving



Summarizing: Your
portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.As I must,
therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I
shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible.My feelings in every respect
forbid it.Can I speak plainer?Do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart.”“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.”To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XX.[Illustration]Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.Mr.Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason.I will speak to her about it myself directly.She is
a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
I will _make_ her know it.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth is attracted to Mr. Collins, but her feelings for him are so strong that it is impossible for her to accept his proposals.
Mr. Collins suggests that his rejection of her is due to his desire to increase her love by creating a sense of suspense.
Despite her repeated refusals, Elizabeth insists that she is not an elegant female and is a rational creature speaking the truth from her



Summarizing: “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.If, therefore, she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.“Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these.In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived.I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out, as she entered the library,--“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will
not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_.”Mr.Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by
her communication.“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
finished her speech.“Of what are you talking?”“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”“And what am I to do on the occasion?It seems a hopeless business.”“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”“Let her be called down.She shall hear my opinion.”Mrs.Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.“I have sent for
you on an affair of importance.I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage.Is it true?”Elizabeth replied that it was.“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”“I have, sir.”“Very well.We now come to the point.Your mother insists upon your
accepting it.Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”“Yes, or I will never see her again.”“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents.Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_.”

Summary: 
Lizzy is described as a good-natured and kind-hearted girl.
Mr. Bennet is concerned about Lizzy's headstrongness and potential temperamental nature.
Lizzy has rejected an offer of marriage from Mr. Collins.
The marriage proposal was made by Lizzy herself.
Elizabeth is determined to force Lizzy into marriage to him.
Bennet has been summoned to



Summarizing: Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?You promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and, secondly, of my room.I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.”Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point.She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns.She endeavoured to secure Jane in
her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.Mr.Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way.His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them.She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here!What do you think has happened this morning?Mr.Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”[Illustration:     “they entered the breakfast room”
]Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her
family.“Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;
“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.”Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as
may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she
can have her own way.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Bennet are engaged in an affair.
Elizabeth was expecting her husband to push for her to marry him.
Mr. Collins has made an offer to his cousin, Lizzy, but she has rejected it.
Lizzy's family members, including Charlotte Lucas, Lydia, Kitty, and Jane, are present at the breakfast-room where the affair is taking place.
Charlotte



Summarizing: But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead._I_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you.I have done with you from this very day.I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word.I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children.Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody.People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking.Nobody can tell what I suffer!But it
is always so.Those who do not complain are never pitied.”Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear.In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected
conversation:--“Oh, Mr. Collins!”“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter.Resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I
trust, I am resigned.Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I
have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all
liable to error.

Summary: 
Lizzy's mother, Mrs. Bennet, warned her daughter, Elizabeth, that she would not be able to keep her after her father's death and warned her to never speak to her again.
Lizzy refused every marriage proposal offered to her by her father, Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, followed by Jane, Kitty, and Lydia.
Mr. Collins



Summarizing: I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXI.[Illustration]The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence.He scarcely ever spoke to
her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill
health.Mr.Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it.He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
well talked over.To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.[Illustration: “Walked back with them”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.The envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Collins are engaged to each other.
Mr. Collins has been trying to find a companion for himself with due consideration for the benefit of his family, including his family.
Mrs. Bennet is in a state of ill health and is often ill, which is a source of concern for both Elizabeth and Mr Collins.
Despite his resentment towards Elizabeth, Collins decides to stay at the



Summarizing: Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs.When they
had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is
from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way
to town; and without any intention of coming back again.You shall hear
what she says.”She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house.The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to
regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence.I depend on you for that.’” To these
high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon
cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country.But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters?Mr.Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.”“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter.I will read it to you.“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.Many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I
despair.

Summary: 
Jane received a letter from Caroline Bingley revealing that Caroline and her party have left Netherfield and are on their way to town without any intention of coming back.
Caroline and her friends are planning to follow their brother, Charles, to Grosvenor Street, where Mr.Hurst had a house.
They have decided to follow Charles to Hertfordshire to avoid him having to spend



Summarizing: I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
whom we shall deprive you.’“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
winter.”“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”“Why will you think so?It must be his own doing; he is his own master.But you do not know _all_.I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me.I will have no reserves from _you_.‘Mr.Darcy is
impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
less eager to meet her again.I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has
her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still
more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
hereafter our sister.I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to
you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country
without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable.My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman’s heart.With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said
Jane, as she finished it.“Is it not clear enough?Does it not expressly
declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that
if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most
kindly!)to put me on my guard.Can there be any other opinion on the
subject?”“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.Will you hear it?”“Most willingly.”“You shall have it in a few words.Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.She follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.”Jane shook her head.“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she
is not such a simpleton.Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.

Summary: 
Lizzy and Jane are planning to spend Christmas in Hertfordshire.
Mr. Darcy is not expected to return this winter.
Georgiana Darcy has attracted the affection of Louisa and Louisa for her beauty, elegance, and accomplishments.
Miss Bingley sees that her brother, Charles, is in love with Lizzy and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.
Lizzy has strong feelings



Summarizing: But the
case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I
dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.But, my
dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your
representation of all this might make me quite easy.But I know the
foundation is unjust.Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself.”“That is right.You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?”“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,
by all means, to refuse him.”“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate.”“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.”“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required.A thousand things may arise in six months.”The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt.It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s
interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.

Summary: 
Jane is determined to get Miss Darcy for her brother.
Jane believes that if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way, she could achieve a successful inter-marriage.
Miss Bingley, whose brother greatly admires Jane, has told Elizabeth that he is less sensible of her merit than he was when he left her on Tuesday.
Elizabeth believes that Caroline is capable of wilfully deceiving anyone



Summarizing: They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
care to have two full courses.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXII.[Illustration]The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the
chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.“It keeps him in good
humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.This was
very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself.Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet.He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.His
reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness.

Summary: 
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases during the chief of the day, during which time Miss Lucas listened to Mr. Collins.
Mrs. Bennet was concerned about the departure of the Bennets' family and their intimate relationship.
Charlotte assured her friend, Elizabeth, of her satisfaction in being useful and thanked her for her sacrifice of time.
Mr. Collins was invited



Summarizing: The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.Mr.Collins’s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair.Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever[Illustration:     “So much love and eloquence”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and
Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins
should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly
expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.
James’s.The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
occasion.The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two
sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.Charlotte
herself was tolerably composed.She had gained her point, and had time
to consider of it.Her reflections were in general satisfactory.Mr.Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.But still he would
be her husband.Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative
from want.This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of
twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
luck of it.The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person.Elizabeth would wonder, and
probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.She resolved
to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family.A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

Summary: 
Mr. Collins is planning to marry Charlotte Bennet, their daughter.
Charlotte is a well-educated young woman of little fortune, but she sees her marriage as the best option for her.
The marriage of Charlotte and Collins has been arranged by Sir William and they are planning to meet at St.James’s in St. James's.
Mrs. Collins has a strong attachment to Charlotte



Summarizing: As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of
the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and
cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,
whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.”They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,--“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my
good sir?You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”“You cannot be too much on your guard.Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.As for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth.”With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.Mrs.Bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion.But on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away.Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

Summary: 
Mr. Bennet has been invited to visit his family at Longbourn by Mrs. Collins.
Mrs. Collins expressed concern about Lady Catherine's disapprobation and advised him not to neglect his relations for fear of offending his patroness, Lady Catherine.
Mr Bennet is under the influence of Lady Catherine and is obliged to heed her advice.
During his stay in Hertfordshire,



Summarizing: The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility
as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out,--“Engaged to Mr. Collins!my dear Charlotte, impossible!”The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied,--“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she
wished her all imaginable happiness.“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,
very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done.I am not romantic, you know.I never
was.I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s
character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.”Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family.Charlotte did not stay much
longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.It
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match.The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted.She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage.Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a
most humiliating picture!And to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.[Illustration:     “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XXIII.[Illustration]

Summary: 
Elizabeth is surprised and surprised to hear that Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, is engaged to him.
Charlotte expresses her happiness and gratitude to Elizabeth for her support and encouragement.
Mr. Collins has made two marriage offers within three days and has accepted the first one.
Elizabeth is not a romantic and asks only for a comfortable home and a comfortable life.
Despite her initial shock,



Summarizing: Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family.With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--“Good Lord!Sir William, how can you tell such a story?Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.Mrs.Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent.In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off.Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.Nothing could
console and nothing appease her.Nor did that day wear out her
resentment.A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.Mr.Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Sir William Lucas are discussing the engagement of their daughter, Charlotte, to a man named Mr. Collins.
Charlotte's daughter, Lydia, announced the engagement to Mr Collins, which was initially disbelieved by her mother, Mrs. Bennet.
Elizabeth felt obligated to relieve Sir William from the unpleasant situation and congratulated him on his engagement to Charlotte.
Mr. Collins expressed happiness and



Summarizing: Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.Kitty and
Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again.Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted.After
discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,
with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained
that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;
for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would
be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early
day for making him the happiest of men.Mr.Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet.On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband.It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome.She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable.Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued
absence.Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.

Summary: 
The match between Miss Lucas and Mr. Collins is a significant event for Kitty, Lydia, Kitty, and Lydia.
Mr. Collins, a clergyman, has been away for a week and has returned to Hertfordshire with a letter of thanks to their father.
Mrs. Bennet is happy to have a daughter well married and often visits her at Longbourn to express her happiness.




Summarizing: Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.Unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring.The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to.But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she should think herself very ill-used.It needed all
Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.Mr.Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction.He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company.The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.[Illustration:     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”
]Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.The sight of
Miss Lucas was odious to her.As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence.Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead.She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

Summary: 
Mr. Bennet was absent from Netherfield for the whole winter due to his attachment to Bingley.
There was a fear among those in Meryton that his sisters would prevent him from returning due to their feelings for him.
Elizabeth feared that the efforts of his sisters and his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and London, might prevent him returning to Netherfield



Summarizing: “Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced
to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.Let us hope for
better things.Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.”“What should not you mind?”“I should not mind anything at all.”“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXIV.[Illustration]Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort.Miss Darcy’s praise occupied
the chief of it.Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter.She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation.Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others.To Caroline’s
assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no
credit.That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations.

Summary: 
The entail of the house is a source of deep distress for Mrs. Bennet.
Lucas suggests that Charlotte might eventually take over the house.
Charlotte expresses hope for better things and suggests that she may be the survivor of the situation.
Caroline expresses happiness for her brother, Mr. Collins, who she believes should have the estate for the sake of his friends.
Elizabeth, who



Summarizing: Had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself.It was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.She
could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had
really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;
whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had
escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s
situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,--“O that my dear mother had more command over herself!she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.But I
will not repine.It cannot last long.He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.”Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no
reason.He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all.I have nothing either to hope or fear, and
nothing to reproach him with.Thank God I have not _that_ pain.A little
time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.”“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good.Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to
you.I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister’s warm affection.“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair._You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody._I_ only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.Do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will.You need not.There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.

Summary: 
Bingley was involved in a relationship that affected the lives of Elizabeth's and her sister's lives.
Elizabeth believes that Bingley chose happiness over his feelings for his sister.
Jane's feelings for Bingley were deepened by her mother's emotional attachment to him.
Despite the change in Bingley's attitude, Elizabeth's opinion of him has not changed and her peace remains the same.



Summarizing: The more I see
of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense.I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,
the other is Charlotte’s marriage.It is unaccountable!in every view it
is unaccountable!”“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.They will
ruin your happiness.You do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper.Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and
Charlotte’s prudent, steady character.Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.”“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart.My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him
cannot have a proper way of thinking.You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas.You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.”“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together.But enough of this.You alluded to something else.You
mentioned _two_ instances.I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk.We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured.We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect.It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us.Women fancy admiration means more than
it does.”“And men take care that they should.”“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”
said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery.

Summary: 
Lizzy is dissatisfied with the world and her belief in the inconsistency of human characters.
Lizzy has met Charlotte Lucas's marriage to Mr. Collins.
Charlotte Lucas is from a large family and is of a prudent, steady character.
Despite Charlotte's character, Lizzy is concerned about Charlotte's feelings for their cousin, Mr. Bingley.
Elizabeth believes Charlotte has a proper way



Summarizing: Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.”“And do you impute it to either of those?”“Yes; to the last.But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I
think of persons you esteem.Stop me, whilst you can.”“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”“I cannot believe it.Why should they try to influence him?They can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it.”“Your first position is false.They may wish many things besides his
happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.”“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better.But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother’s.What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable?If they believed him attached to me they would not try to
part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy.Do not distress me by the idea.I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.Let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.Mrs.Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity.Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.Mrs.Bennet’s best
comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.Mr.Bennet treated the matter differently.“So, Lizzy,” said he, one
day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find.I congratulate her.Next
to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and
then.

Summary: 
Jane supposes his sisters influence him, possibly in conjunction with his friend, Mr. Bingley.
Jane believes that his sisters wish him happiness and that if he is attached to her, no other woman can secure it.
Mr.Bennet treats the matter differently, congratulating Jane's sister who he believes is in love with him.
He believes that if his sisters had tried to



Summarizing: It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions.When is your turn to come?You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane.Now is your time.Here are officers enough at
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.Let Wickham
be your man.He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.We must not
all expect Jane’s good fortune.”“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
always make the most of it.”Mr.Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family.They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve.The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
Hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXV.[Illustration]After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.
Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday.The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to
hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.He took leave
of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at
Longbourn.Mr.Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable.Mrs.Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces.Between the two
eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.

Summary: 
Jane has a reputation among the young ladies in the country for being kind, intelligent, elegant, and kind.
Mr. Bennet and Mr. Collins are officers at Meryton.
Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than his sister, is an amiable, intelligent and elegant woman and a great favourite with her LongBourn nieces.
Wickham's society



Summarizing: They had frequently been staying with her in town.The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.When this was
done, she had a less active part to play.It became her turn to listen.Mrs.Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.Two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could.But, Lizzy!Oh, sister!it is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness.He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him.The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever.The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,
sister.They are all for what they can get.I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is.It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else.However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves.”Mrs.Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she.“I
am sorry it went off.But these things happen so often!A young man,
such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty
girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily
forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”[Illustration:     “Offended two or three young ladies”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not
do for _us_.We do not suffer by accident.It does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.”“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.

Summary: 
Mrs. Gardiner and Bennet are related by blood, with Bennet being her sister-in-law and Gardiner her sister.
Bennet has a lot to complain about and has been ill-used since she last saw her sister, Elizabeth.
Two of Gardiner's sisters, Jane and Elizabeth, were on the verge of marriage, but Jane rejected an offer from Mr. Collins



Summarizing: It is as
often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.Pray, how _violent was_
Mr. Bingley’s love?”“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable.At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer.Could there be
finer symptoms?Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”“Oh, yes!of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.Poor
Jane!I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately.It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.But do you think she would
be prevailed on to go back with us?Change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.”Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister’s ready acquiescence.“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her.We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a
part of London!My dear aunt, how could you think of it?Mr.Darcy may,
perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.”“So much the better.I hope they will not meet at all.But does not Jane
correspond with his sister?_She_ will not be able to help calling.”“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”But, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless.It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s
attractions.

Summary: 
Mr. Bingley is deeply in love with Jane, growing increasingly indifferent to other people and wholly engrossed in her every time they meet.
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance.
Elizabeth has spoken to him twice without receiving an answer to her inquiries about his feelings for Jane.
Jane has a disposition which makes it difficult for her to



Summarizing: Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she
might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement.Mrs.Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner.When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.Without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers.About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of Derbyshire to which he belonged.They had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been
in the way of procuring.Mrs.Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well.Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse.In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with
the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself.On being made acquainted with the
present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might
agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having
heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy.[Illustration:     “Will you come and see me?”

CHAPTER XXVI.[Illustration]Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly.

Summary: 
The Gardiners stay at Longbourn for a week every year, spending time there with the Phillipses, Lucases, and the officers.
Mrs. Gardiner was initially suspicious of Elizabeth and Mr. Wickham's apparent preference for each other.
Elizabeth had spent a considerable time in the part of Derbyshire to which Wickham belonged before her marriage.
They had a common acquaintance with the



Summarizing: Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.Do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent.I have nothing to say against
_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better.But as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you.You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it.Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure.You must not disappoint your father.”“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.”“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”“I beg your pardon.I will try again.At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not.I see the imprudence
of it.Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!My father’s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that
it would be wiser to resist?All that I can promise you, therefore, is
not to be in a hurry.I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his
first object.When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.In
short, I will do my best.”“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often.At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.But do not imagine
that he is always here so often.It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week.You know my mother’s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is in love with Mr. Wickham.
Elizabeth's aunt warns her not to involve herself or involve herself in an affection which would be imprudent due to her lack of fortune.
Despite her feelings for Wickham, Elizabeth insists that she is not in love and hopes to engage her aunt in a serious relationship.
Her father is partial to Wickham due to his fondness



Summarizing: But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you
are satisfied.”Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented.Mr.Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet.His
marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the
wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her out of the room.As they went down stairs together,
Charlotte said,--“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”“_That_ you certainly shall.”“And I have another favour to ask.Will you come and see me?”“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford.”Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and
I hope you will consent to be of the party.Indeed, Eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them.”The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual.Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible.Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was.Charlotte’s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise.The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging.

Summary: 
Elizabeth expressed disappointment and sympathy towards Mr. Collins and his bride, Lady Catherine, and expressed her wish for them to be happy.
Mr. Collins returned to Hertfordshire after the wedding and took up his abode with the Lucases, which was not a great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet.
After the wedding, Charlotte and Elizabeth parted, with Charlotte promising to keep in touch with each



Summarizing: It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is.Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline.She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London.I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.I inquired after their brother, of course.He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her.My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.I dare say I shall
soon see them here.”Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention.After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself
no longer.The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
will prove what she felt:--     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me.But, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.I do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should
     be deceived again.

Summary: 
Jane and Elizabeth are sisters who have a close relationship.
Mr. Collins has a picture of Hunsford and Rosings.
Elizabeth is impatient to know the details of the Bingleys' arrival in London.
Jane has been in town for a week without seeing or hearing from Caroline.
Her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had been lost and she thought it might have been



Summarizing: Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.When she
     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she
     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so
     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.I pity, though I
     cannot help blaming, her.She was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side.But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it.I need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.I cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all
     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.He knows of my
     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.I cannot
     understand it.If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be
     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this.I will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.Let me hear
     from you very soon.Miss Bingley said something of his never
     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty.We had better not mention it.I am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     Hunsford.Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.I am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.“Yours, etc.”This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.She would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions.

Summary: 
Caroline did not return my visit until yesterday.
Caroline made a formal apology for not calling before and expressed no desire to see me again.
I pity Caroline for her behaviour and believe it is caused by her brother's anxiety for her.
The brother knows about Caroline's existence in town.
Miss Bingley suggests that Caroline's brother might never return to Netherfield and give up the house.



Summarizing: His character sunk on every
review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.Mrs.Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself.His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else.Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it.The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil.But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King.I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl.There can be no love in all this.My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do.They are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
plain.”

CHAPTER XXVII.[Illustration]With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford.

Summary: 
Elizabeth believes that Darcy's character has sunk and hopes he will eventually marry Jane.
Mrs.Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of a promise she had made to her aunt.
Wickham had a sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds from a young lady named Charlotte.
Despite her feelings for Wickham, Elizabeth did not quarrel with him for his independence.
After the events of January and February, Elizabeth decided



Summarizing: She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the
plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater
pleasure as well as greater certainty.Absence had increased her desire
of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake.The journey would, moreover, give
her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay.Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch.She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.The improvement of
spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as
perfect as plan could be.The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more.His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable.Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise.Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William’s too long.He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when
they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever.

Summary: 
Charlotte is planning to accompany Sir William and his second daughter, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, on a journey to London.
Charlotte has a strong desire to see Charlotte again and is disgusted with Mr. Collins.
The plan to spend a night in London was added to Charlotte's plan due to her father's dislike of the journey.
Elizabeth is fond of Sir William because he has been the first



Summarizing: On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.All was joy and
kindness.The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.Their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection.It was reasonable, however, to
hope that they would not continue long.Mrs.Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.Mrs.Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King?I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive?Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin?Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.”“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.”“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.I know no harm of her.”“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
made her mistress of this fortune?”“No--why should he?If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?”“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
soon after this event.”“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe.If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?”“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_.It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose._He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and her family have not seen each other for a year.
They spent the day together, spending the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres.
Mrs.Gardiner gave Elizabeth information about Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street and conversations between Jane and her sister.
Jane's sister, Jane, struggles to support her and suffers from depression.



Summarizing: I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better.I am sick of them all.Thank heaven!I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manners nor sense to recommend him.Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.”“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.
Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.“My dear, dear
aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight!what felicity!You give me
fresh life and vigour.Adieu to disappointment and spleen.What are men
to rocks and mountains?Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend!And
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of anything.We _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.Lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation.Let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”
[Illustration:     “At the door”
]
CHAPTER XXVIII.[Illustration]Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side.Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.At length the Parsonage was discernible.The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving.Mr.Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party.

Summary: 
Lizzy has a negative opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire and Hertfordshire.
Lizzy is planning to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed to take in the summer.
They are planning to travel to the Lakes.
Elizabeth is excited about the prospect of the tour and is looking forward to meeting her aunt and uncle.
Mr. Collins and



Summarizing: In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other.Mrs.Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received.She saw
instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:
his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family.They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
offers of refreshment.Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.But though
everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.When Mr.
Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
Charlotte.Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
Charlotte wisely did not hear.After sitting long enough to admire
every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the
fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself.To work in his garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible.Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump.But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.It was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mrs.Collins are cousins and have a close relationship.
Mrs.Collins welcomed her friend, Elizabeth, warmly upon her arrival.
Elizabeth is pleased with her cousin's manners despite his marriage and formal civility.
Mr. Collins has a house in Rosings, a modern building situated on rising ground.
The house is neat, comfortable, and has a good proportion of space and



Summarizing: From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
help.It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed,--“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her.She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over.I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here.Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming.We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home.Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us.I
_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added
Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well.She had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse
with Rosings.A lively imagination soon settled it all.About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.She opened
the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,--[Illustration:     “In Conversation with the ladies”

Summary: 
Charlotte and Sir William accompanied their sister and friend, Elizabeth and Maria, to Charlotte's house, which was described as small, well-built and convenient.
Charlotte showed the house without the assistance of her husband, Mr. Collins.
The house was well-planned and well-maintained and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency.
Elizabeth and Maria



Summarizing: [Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]]“Oh, my dear Eliza!pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen!I will not tell you what it is.Make
haste, and come down this moment.”Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;
and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth.“I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter!”“La!my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady
Catherine.The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.The
other is Miss De Bourgh.Only look at her.She is quite a little
creature.Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.Why does she not come in?”“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does.It is the greatest of favours
when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.“She
looks sickly and cross.Yes, she will do for him very well.She will
make him a very proper wife.”Mr.Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that
way.At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house.Mr.Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.[Illustration:     ‘Lady Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure.’[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]
CHAPTER XXIX.[Illustration]Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady
Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by
her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
at Rosings.I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it would happen.

Summary: 
The conversation takes place in a dining-room where two ladies, Lady Catherine and her daughter, Miss De Bourgh, are seen stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.
The daughter is described as thin and small.
Elizabeth is surprised and surprised to see Lady Catherine's daughter, who she perceives as abominably rude, keeping Charlotte out of the garden in the wind.




Summarizing: But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine
there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so
immediately after your arrival?”“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings.Mr.Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
Elizabeth,--“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and daughter.I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more.Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed.She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.Such formidable accounts of
her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,
who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James’s.As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park.Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her.She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
thought she could witness without trepidation.From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,
her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Sir William received an invitation to dine at Rosings immediately after their arrival.
Mr. Collins was preparing them for their visit to Rosings and advised them to dress elegantly.
Lady Catherine, Lady Catherine's daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were present at the dinner, which was served by Mr. Collins.
Maria Lucas, also known as Maria Lucas, was apprehensive about her



Summarizing: Her Ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look.Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly.Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome.Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank.She was not rendered formidable by
silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as
marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her
being so thin and so small.There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies.Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater.He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who
was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.But Lady
Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty
to them.The party did not supply much conversation.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is a tall, large woman with strongly-marked features and a strong sense of self-importance.
Her Ladyship, Lady Catherine, introduced herself to the guests at St. James’s without any apologies and thanks.
The guests, including Sir William and his daughter, were surprised by the grandeur and grandeur of the place.
Lady Catherine has a strong, authoritative tone



Summarizing: Elizabeth was ready
to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between
Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
the dinnertime.Mrs.Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how
little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and
fearing she was indisposed.Maria thought speaking out of the question,
and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted.She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry.Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an
occasion for dictating to others.In the intervals of her discourse with
Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl.She asked her at different times how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother’s maiden name?Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly.Lady Catherine then
observed,--“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think?For your
sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line.It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?”“A little.”“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
some day.Do your sisters play and sing?”“One of them does.”“Why did not you all learn?You ought all to have learned.The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.Do
you draw?”“No, not at all.”“What, none of you?”“Not one.”“That is very strange.But I suppose you had no opportunity.Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Charlotte were seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh during the dinnertime.
Charlotte was engaged in watching and listening to Lady Catherine.
Mrs.Jenkinson was mainly involved in observing how little Miss de Bough ate and giving her advice on domestic matters.
Elizabeth found Lady Catherine decisive and decisive, delivering her opinion on every subject in a decisive manner.
During their conversation



Summarizing: “My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”“Has your governess left you?”“We never had any governess.”“No governess!How was that possible?Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess!I never heard of such a thing.Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.”Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.“Then who taught you?who attended to you?Without a governess, you must
have been neglected.”“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means.We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary.Those who chose to be
idle certainly might.”“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one.I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way.I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her.Mrs.Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s
calling yesterday to thank me?She finds Miss Pope a treasure.‘Lady
Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”“Yes, ma’am, all.”“All!What, all five out at once?Very odd!And you only the second.The
younger ones out before the elder are married!Your younger sisters must
be very young?”“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company.But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early.The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first.And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person.Pray, what is your age?”“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth has five daughters brought up at home without a governess due to her father disliking London.
The governess was not present during Elizabeth's childhood, but she was encouraged to read and learn.
Despite not having any governess, Elizabeth has been the source of many families' education needs and has provided for them through her means.
Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are well-



Summarizing: Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age.”“I am not one-and-twenty.”When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed.Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party.Their table was superlatively stupid.Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light.A great deal more passed at the
other table.Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.Mr.Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.Sir William did not say much.He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow.From these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed.As
soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,
for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was.But
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s
praise into his own hands.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXX.[Illustration]Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with.

Summary: 
Lady Catherine and Elizabeth are two girls who were present at a card game with a group of men, including Sir William, Mr. Collins, and Mrs. Jenkinson.
The card game was played by Lady Catherine and her daughter, Miss De Bourgh, who chose to play at cassino.
Mr. Collins agreed to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won and



Summarizing: While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in
reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,
which fronted the road.The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day.She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had
a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours.Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits.She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.[Illustration:     “he never failed to inform them”
]The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first.

Summary: 
When Sir William was with the family, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country.
After Sir William's departure, the family returned to their usual jobs, with the exception of Elizabeth's cousin, Charlotte, who preferred the dining parlour to the dining room due to its better size and better aspect.
The dining room in which the ladies



Summarizing: Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach.This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors.Her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important.Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have[Illustration:“The gentlemen accompanied him.”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage
turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence.On the
following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.There were
two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought
with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;
and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,
the gentlemen accompanied him.Charlotte had seen them from her
husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.Mr.Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman.

Summary: 
Elizabeth spends her time with Charlotte and enjoys spending time out of doors during her visits to Rosings.
Elizabeth's favorite walk in Rosings is along an open grove and a sheltered path in an open area of the park.
Charlotte and Elizabeth have a pleasant conversation with each other during their visits.
Mr. Darcy is expected to arrive at Rosings in a few weeks and his



Summarizing: Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure.Elizabeth merely
courtesied to him, without saying a word.Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family.She answered him in the usual
way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--“My eldest sister has been in town these three months.Have you never
happened to see her there?”She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.The
subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.[Illustration:“At Church”
]
CHAPTER XXXI.[Illustration]Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at Rosings.It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening.For the last week they had seen very little
of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.Colonel Fitzwilliam had called
at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had
only seen at church.The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room.Her Ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,
moreover, caught his fancy very much.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy and Mrs. Collins are cousins.
Elizabeth, his cousin's sister, has been in town for three months and hasn't seen him in three months.
Mrs. Collins asked Elizabeth about the health of her family and asked if he had seen his eldest sister, Miss Bennet.
The ladies at Rosings had been visiting the Parsonage during the time they were at Ros



Summarizing: He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as
well as of Mr. Darcy._His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,--“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?What is it you are talking
of?What are you telling Miss Bennet?Let me hear what it is.”“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.“Of music!Then pray speak aloud.It is of all subjects my delight.I
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true
enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.If I had ever
learnt, I should have been a great proficient.And so would Anne, if her
health had allowed her to apply.I am confident that she would have
performed delightfully.How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”Mr.Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady
Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal.”“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.She practises very constantly.”“So much the better.It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.I often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice.I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will
never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson’s room.She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part
of the house.”Mr.Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.He
drew a chair near her.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam are engaged in a lively conversation about Kent and Hertfordshire, travel and staying at home, new books and music.
Elizabeth has never been so entertained in a room before.
The conversation attracted the attention of Lady Catherine and Mr. Darcy.
Mr.Darcy praised his sister, Georgiana, and advised her to practice to improve her playing skills.
Lady



Summarizing: Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s
countenance.Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me.But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others.My courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me.”“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
are not your own.”Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit.Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam.“I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful.The
first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at
a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?He danced only four
dances!I am sorry to pain you, but so it was.He danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.Mr.Darcy,
you cannot deny the fact.”“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.”“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?My fingers wait your orders.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth accuses her cousin, Mr. Darcy, of trying to frighten her by coming to hear her.
Darcy denies any intention to alarm her and insists that he enjoys expressing opinions which are not his own.
Elizabeth believes that Darcy's sister, Elizabeth's cousin, is capable of playing the piano well.
Colonel Fitzwilliam is aware of Darcy’s past activities



Summarizing: “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an
introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.“Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?”“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to
him.It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.”“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women’s do.They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take
the trouble of practising.It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers
as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right.You have employed your
time much better.No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting.We neither of us perform to strangers.”Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of.Elizabeth immediately began playing again.Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy,--“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master.She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s.Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste.Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was
ready to take them all home.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXXII.[Illustration]

Summary: 
Darcy is ill-qualified to recommend himself to strangers, according to his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam.
Fitzwilliam will not recommend Darcy to strangers because he does not want to give himself trouble.
Darcy has difficulty conversing easily with those he has never seen before and does not catch their tone of conversation or interest in their concerns.
Elizabeth has a talent for playing the violin



Summarizing: Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor.As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.
Darcy only, entered the room.He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,--“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before.He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”“Perfectly so, I thank you.”She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short
pause, added,--“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?”“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future.He has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.”“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there.But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle.”“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”Elizabeth made no answer.She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
house.Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.”“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”“Mr.

Summary: 
Elizabeth was writing to Jane the next morning when a knock at the door indicated a surprise visit from Lady Catherine and Mr. Darcy.
Lady Catherine was alone in the room when the door was opened by Darcy, who was surprised to find her alone.
Darcy apologized for intruding into the room, explaining that he had understood all the ladies to be within.
Elizabeth was surprised by the



Summarizing: Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had.My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest
thing she ever did.She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.”“An easy distance do you call it?It is nearly fifty miles.”“And what is fifty miles of good road?Little more than half a day’s
journey.Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,” cried Elizabeth.“I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family.”“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family.The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances.Where there is fortune to make the expense of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.But that is not the
case _here_.Mr.and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.”Mr.Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment._You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn.”Elizabeth looked surprised.The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--“Are you pleased with Kent?”A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk.The _tête-à-tête_
surprised them.Mr.Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his
intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,
without saying much to anybody, went away.[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]

Summary: 
Charlotte Collins is a sensible woman who would have accepted and made Mr. Collins happy.
Mr. Collins has chosen Charlotte Collins as his wife.
Mrs. Collins is settled in Hertfordshire, a distance of nearly fifty miles, which is less than half a day's journey.
Charlotte and Mr. Darcy have a strong attachment to their hometown, Longbourn.
The proposed



Summarizing: “What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone.“My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called on us in this familiar way.”But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year.All field sports were over.Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day.They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt.It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there
was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she
believed he might have the best informed mind.But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult
to understand.It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself.He seldom appeared really
animated.Mrs.Collins knew not what to make of him.Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable.It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

Summary: 
Charlotte and Eliza are surprised by the unexpected visit of Colonel Fitzwilliam.
Colonel Fitz visits the Parsonage almost every day, often with his cousin, Mr. Darcy, who lives there.
The visit is likely due to the time of year when all field sports are over and there are no activities for men to engage in.
Both Eliza and Charlotte find pleasure in



Summarizing: She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam.He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.[Illustration: “On looking up”]
CHAPTER XXXIII.[Illustration]More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
that it was a favourite haunt of hers.How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd!Yet it did, and even the third.It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too.His words seemed to imply it.Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.It distressed her
a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,
she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally
do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mrs. Collins have a close relationship with Colonel Fitzwilliam.
Mrs. Collins has long suspected that Colonel Fitz will be attracted to Elizabeth.
Colonel Fitz william has been making a tour of the park every year and intends to visit the Parsonage at the end of his tour.
Elizabeth has a fondness for Colonel Fitz and has often planned her marrying him.
During



Summarizing: Are you going much farther?”“No, I should have turned in a moment.”And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.But I am at his disposal.He
arranges the business just as he pleases.”“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice.I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.“But so we all do.It is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.I speak
feelingly.A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.”“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either.Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence?When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature.But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from the want of money.Younger sons cannot marry
where they like.”“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do.”“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.”“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is
the usual price of an earl’s younger son?Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,--“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal.I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind.But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.”“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must
divide with me.I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”“Are you, indeed?And pray what sort of a guardian do you make?Does
your charge give you much trouble?

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam are walking towards the Parsonage in Kent on Saturday.
They are discussing Mr. Darcy's business arrangements and his enjoyment of the power of choice he enjoys.
Elizabeth believes that Darcy has a better means of managing his business than many others because he is rich and many others are poor.
Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an earl



Summarizing: Young ladies of her age are sometimes
a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth.She directly replied,--“You need not be frightened.I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley.I think I have heard you say that you know them.”“I know them a little.Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike
man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr.Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”“Care of him!Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care.From something that he told me
in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted
to him.But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose
that Bingley was the person meant.It was all conjecture.”“What is it you mean?”“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it
would be an unpleasant thing.”“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley.What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.”“And what arts did he use to separate them?”“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling.“He
only told me what I have now told you.”Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation.After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she.“Your
cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings.Why was he to be the
judge?”

Summary: 
Fitzwilliam is aware of Miss Darcy who is a difficult young lady who can be difficult to manage.
Miss Darcy is a great favourite with some ladies of his acquaintance, including Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.
He is also aware of their brother, Mr. Darcy, who is described as a pleasant, gentlemanlike man and a great friend of Darcy's



Summarizing: “You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.But,”
she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.”“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the Parsonage.There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard.It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence.That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them.If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that
Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.He had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is!Her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.

Summary: 
Fitzwilliam is upset about Mr. Darcy's interference in the case of Mr. Bingley and Jane, accusing him of diminishing the honour of his cousin's triumph.
Despite Fitzwilliam's distaste, Darcy believes it is not fair to condemn him due to the fact that they do not know the details of the case and do not have intimate knowledge of it.
F



Summarizing: Neither could
anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought
of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.
Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.Mrs.Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXXIV.[Illustration]When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent.They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.Mr.Darcy’s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister’s sufferings.It was some consolation to
think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his
cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

Summary: 
Elizabeth is feeling unwell, but she is determined not to let any objections from her mother sway her.
Elizabeth believes that her father, Pearce Darcy, has abilities which Mr. Darcy cannot match.
Mrs.Collins, seeing that Elizabeth was unwell and not feeling well, did not press her to go to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea with her cousins.




Summarizing: While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room.In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.She answered him with cold civility.He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room.Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word.After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:--“In vain have I struggled.It will not do.My feelings will not be
repressed.You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you.”Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression.She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent.This he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately
followed.He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
tenderness than of pride.His sense of her inferiority, of its being a
degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger.She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done.He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand.As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a
favourable answer.He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security.Such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
and she said,--“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned.It is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly.

Summary: 
Elizabeth was expecting a visit from Colonel Fitzwilliam, who had previously visited her late in the evening and inquired about her health.
Colonel Fitz william was surprised to see Mr. Darcy walk into the room and immediately began an inquiry into her health, which she interprets as a wish to hear that she were better.
Mr.Darcy expressed deep affection for Elizabeth, expressing his



Summarizing: I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone.It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration.The feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.”Mr.Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise.His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature.He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it.The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings
dreadful.At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!I
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected.But it is of small importance.”“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?But I have
other provocations.You know I have.Had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?”As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued,--“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.You dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.”She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success.Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself.”Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

Summary: 
Mr. Darcy apologizes for causing pain to anyone.
Elizabeth reveals that she has long harbored feelings of affection for him and has been unable to acknowledge his affection.
Darcy reacts with resentment and anger to Elizabeth's words, expressing his feelings of rejection and anger.
Despite his anger, Darcy maintains his composure and does not open his lips until he believes he has achieved composure.



Summarizing: “But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
is founded.Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided.Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham.On this subject, what can you have to
say?In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him?”“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed.”“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have
reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty.You
have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed
for him.You have deprived the best years of his life of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert.You have done
all this!and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
contempt and ridicule.”“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
“is your opinion of me!This is the estimation in which you hold me!I
thank you for explaining it so fully.My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed!But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything.But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.They were natural and just.Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the
concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.”She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth has a strong dislike for Mr. Darcy, which was formed by a recital which she received from Mr. Wickham.
Elizabeth accuses Darcy of inflicting harm on a gentleman who has suffered great misfortunes.
She accuses him of reducing the gentleman to a state of comparative poverty and depriving him of the best years of his life.
Darcy denies the accusations against him



Summarizing: Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.She went on,--“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”“You have said quite enough, madam.I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.”And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.The tumult of
her mind was now painfully great.She knew not how to support herself,
and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour.Her
astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
every review of it.That she should receive an offer of marriage from
Mr. Darcy!that he should have been in love with her for so many months!so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which
must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
incredible!it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
an affection.But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal
of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner
which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not
attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
attachment had for a moment excited.She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady
Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.[Illustration:“Hearing herself called”
]
CHAPTER XXXV.[Illustration]Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes.She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have known each other for less than a month.
Elizabeth has a strong dislike for Mr.Darcy due to his arrogance, conceit, and selfish disdain for others.
MrDarcy has been in love with Elizabeth for many months.
Despite his love for Elizabeth, MrDarcy had previously tried to prevent his friend's marrying her sister.
Due to her disapproval



Summarizing: The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park.The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees.She was on the point of continuing her
walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove
which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.But the person who advanced was
now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her name.She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again
towards the gate.He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
meeting you.Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and
then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
out of sight.With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand.The envelope itself was likewise
full.Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read.You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.

Summary: 
Elizabeth has been in Kent for five weeks and has been walking in the country enjoying the change in the weather and early trees.
She passed a park which was still the boundary on one side of a lane and was tempted to stop at the gates of the park.
A gentleman named Mr. Darcy was moving towards the park and called her name.
The gentleman named Rosings, a letter



Summarizing: Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison.But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
their motives has been read.If, in the explanation of them which is due
to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.The necessity must
be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.I had not been long in
Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley
preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.But
it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any
apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.I had often seen him
in love before.At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with
you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental
information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to
a general expectation of their marriage.He spoke of it as a certain
event, of which the time alone could be undecided.From that moment I
observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive
that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed
in him.Your sister I also watched.Her look and manners were open,
cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that
though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
them by any participation of sentiment.If _you_ have not been mistaken
here, _I_ must have been in an error.Your superior knowledge of your
sister must make the latter probable.If it be so, if I have been misled
by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
unreasonable.But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
was not likely to be easily touched.That I was desirous of believing
her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my
investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
fears.I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I
believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.

Summary: 
Bingham was once the acknowledged favourite of my father and was brought up to rely heavily on his patronage.
Bingham and I were involved in a romantic relationship which ended after only a few weeks of affection.
I discovered that Bingley was in love with Sir William Lucas' elder sister, Miss Bennet, at a ball at Netherfield.
At the ball, I was introduced to Sir



Summarizing: My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night
acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
my friend as to me.But there were other causes of repugnance; causes
which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
immediately before me.These causes must be stated, though briefly.The
situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend
you.But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
disposition of both.I will only say, farther, that from what passed
that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my
friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.He left
Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,
remember, with the design of soon returning.The part which I acted is
now to be explained.His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited
with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.We accordingly
went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
friend the certain evils of such a choice.I described and enforced them
earnestly.But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have
prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference.He had before
believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard.But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
dependence on my judgment than on his own.To convince him, therefore,
that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point.To persuade
him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
given, was scarcely the work of a moment.I cannot blame myself for
having done thus much.There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I
condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
your sister’s being in town.

Summary: 
Bingham and his friend are engaged in a romantic relationship.
Both Bingley and I have strong feelings of repulsion towards the proposed marriage.
Bingham's mother's family has a reputation for perceived lack of propriety and perceived betrayal.
Despite his repulsion, Bingley managed to convince his friend not to return to Hertfordshire after the wedding.
The reason for Bingley's



Summarizing: I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss
Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.That they might
have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some
danger.Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.It is
done, however, and it was done for the best.On this subject I have
nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.If I have wounded your
sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not
yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty
accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by
laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.Of what he
has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I
shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.Mr.Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
therefore liberally bestowed.My father supported him at school, and
afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
give him a gentleman’s education.My father was not only fond of this
young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the
highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
intended to provide for him in it.As for myself, it is many, many years
since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.The
vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to
guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy
could not have.Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you
only can tell.But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has
created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding
his real character.It adds even another motive.My excellent father
died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the
last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to
promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
might be his as soon as it became vacant.There was also a legacy of
one thousand pounds.

Summary: 
Bingley and her brother are in a close and intimate relationship.
Wickham is the son of a respectable man, George Wickham, who was the manager of the Pemberley estates for many years.
George Wickham was the godson of Bingley's father, who supported him at school and Cambridge.
Despite the closeness of their relationship, Bingley chooses to conceal



Summarizing: His own father did not long survive mine; and
within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me
that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should
not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
benefited.He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I
must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
insufficient support therein.I rather wished than believed him to be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
proposal.I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.The
business was therefore soon settled.He resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.All connection
between us seemed now dissolved.I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.In town, I believe, he
chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being
now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and
dissipation.For about three years I heard little of him; but on the
decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.His
circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,
were exceedingly bad.He had found the law a most unprofitable study,
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present
him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little
doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,
and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.You will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition of it.His resentment was in proportion to
the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in
his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.After this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.How he lived, I
know not.But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my
notice.I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me
to unfold to any human being.Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of
your secrecy.My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and
myself.

Summary: 
Mr. Wickham's father did not survive his own father.
After his father's death, Mr Wickham decided not to take orders and sought a more immediate financial advantage.
Mr Wickham planned to study the law and offered three thousand pounds in exchange for his resignation from the church.
The interest of one thousand pounds would have been insufficient for his studies and he found the law an unprof



Summarizing: About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with
the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.
Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior
acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were
most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far
recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement.She
was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to
herself.I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
acknowledged the whole to me.You may imagine what I felt and how I
acted.Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,
and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge.Mr.Wickham’s
chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty
thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
himself on me was a strong inducement.His revenge would have been
complete indeed.This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
towards Mr. Wickham.I know not in what manner, under what form of
falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
either.Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
not in your inclination.You may possibly wonder why all this was not
told you last night.But I was not then master enough of myself to know
what could or ought to be revealed.For the truth of everything here
related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel
Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.If
your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour
to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
course of the morning.I will only add, God bless you.“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”

Summary: 
Georgiana was taken from school and an establishment formed in London and went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate last summer.
There was a prior acquaintance between Mr. Wickham and Mrs. Younge.
Mr.Wickham recommended himself to Georgiana due to his kindness towards her as a child.

Summarizing: 
CHAPTER XXXVI.[Illustration]Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents.But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at Netherfield.She read with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes.His belief of her sister’s
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
wish of doing him justice.He expressed no regret for what he had done
which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.It was all
pride and insolence.But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!This cannot be!This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words.So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to
the will, the difference was great.What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err.

Summary: 
Elizabeth received a letter from Mr. Darcy offering her an apology and a renewal of his offers.
The letter revealed an account of events at Netherfield and Mr. Wickham's connection with the Pemberley family.
Wickham expressed no regret for what he did and expressed only pride and haughty style, which satisfied Elizabeth.
After reading the account of the events of Netherfield



Summarizing: But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.She put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success.On both sides it was only assertion.Again she read on.But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice.She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance.Of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told[Illustration:     “Meeting accidentally in Town”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]himself.As to his real character, had information been in her power,
she had never felt a wish of inquiring.His countenance, voice, and
manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone
for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what
Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
continuance.But no such recollection befriended her.She could see him
instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could
remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the
neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
the mess.After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once
more continued to read.But, alas!the story which followed, of his
designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed
between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at
last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel
Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the
information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose
character she had no reason to question.

Summary: 
Wickham resigned from his profession and received a substantial sum of money in lieu of his resignation.
The circumstances surrounding Wickham's resignation shocked and disturbed her.
Despite her initial reservations, she concluded that the affair involving Wickham and Mr. Darcy, which she initially believed to be less than infamous, was a scandalous affair.
Colonel Fitzwilliam confirmed the truth of his



Summarizing: At one time she had almost
resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness
of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that
Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been
well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before.She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct.She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week.She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!His
attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown.Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his
actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.

Summary: 
Wickham and Jane have known each other since their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.
Jane is attracted to Wickham and reconsidered applying to him due to the support of his cousin, who vouched for him.
Despite her feelings for Wickham, Jane is uncomfortable with his conduct and considers him to be a stranger.
She considers his actions as a violation of everything



Summarizing: Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.“How despicably have I acted!” she cried.“I, who have prided myself on
my discernment!I, who have valued myself on my abilities!who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity in useless or blameless distrust.How humiliating is this
discovery!Yet, how just a humiliation!Had I been in love, I could not
have been more wretchedly blind.But vanity, not love, has been my
folly.Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
concerned.Till this moment, I never knew myself.”From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal.How could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other?He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious
of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what
Charlotte’s opinion had always been.Neither could she deny the justice
of his description of Jane.She felt that Jane’s feelings, though
fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
of shame was severe.The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.It soothed, but
it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

Summary: 
Charlotte is feeling humiliated and ashamed after discovering that she has acted despicably in her relationship with Mr. Darcy and Mr. Wickham.
Charlotte considers herself blind, partial, prejudiced, and often disdained by her sister's candour.
She has been pleased with Darcy's preference for one of them and offended by the neglect of the other from the start of their acquaintance



Summarizing: After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and
reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so
important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at
length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
must make her unfit for conversation.She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found.Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it.Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object.She could think only of her letter.[Illustration:“His parting obeisance”
]
CHAPTER XXXVII.[Illustration]The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.To Rosings he then
hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
Ladyship’s indignation would have been.“What would she have said?how
would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
herself.Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party.“I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as I do.But I am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!They were excessively sorry to go!But so they always are.The dear
Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year.His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”Mr.Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--

Summary: 
Elizabeth has returned home after a two-hour break due to fatigue and a recollection of her long absence.
During her absence, two gentlemen from Rosings, Mr. Darcy and Colonel Fitzwilliam, had been waiting near the lodges for her, hoping for her return and waiting for her.
Elizabeth was missing him and no longer felt concern for him due to her letter.
Mr.



Summarizing: “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer.Mrs.Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.”“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it.I must be in town
next Saturday.”“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.I expected
you to stay two months.I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.There
can be no occasion for your going so soon.Mrs.Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.”“But my father cannot.He wrote last week to hurry my return.”[Illustration:“Dawson”[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.And if you will
stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you
as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and
as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good
room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be
cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
large.”“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.”Lady Catherine seemed resigned.“Mrs.Collins, you must send a servant
with them.You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves.It is highly improper.You must contrive to send somebody.I have the greatest dislike in the
world to that sort of thing.Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her.Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.
Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner.I am excessively attentive to all those
things.You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.I am
glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”“Oh!Your uncle!He keeps a man-servant, does he?I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things.Where shall you change horses?Oh, Bromley, of course.If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth has been in town for only six weeks and expected to stay for two months.
Mrs. Collins had expected Elizabeth to stay two months longer.
Bennet could spare Elizabeth for another fortnight due to her father's inability to hurry her return.
Lady Catherine suggested that Elizabeth should write to her mother to beg for more time.
If Elizabeth stays another month, Lady Catherine would like to take one



Summarizing: Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was
necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.Reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave
way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a
solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of
unpleasant recollections.Mr.Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different.When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.They were hopeless of remedy.Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement?Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing.They were ignorant, idle, and vain.While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.His affection was proved to
have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Summary: 
Elizabeth has many questions about their journey, but is too occupied to answer them all herself.
Catherine has a strong preference for solitary hours and often finds solace in them.
Mr. Darcy has written a letter to Elizabeth, which she has memorized by heart.
Elizabeth's feelings towards Mr.Darcy's letter are widely different, with initial indignation and anger directed against him,



Summarizing: Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first.The very last evening was spent
there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out
her hand to both.[Illustration:“The elevation of his feelings.”
]
CHAPTER XXXVIII.[Illustration]On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it.The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.We know
how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode.Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
your time unpleasantly.”Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.She had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel
the obliged.Mr.Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,--“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably.We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that
your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.Our situation
with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.You see on
what a footing we are.You see how continually we are engaged there.In
truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this
humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast on Saturday morning before leaving Rosings.
During her stay at Rosings, Elizabeth spent her last week with Lady Catherine and her last evening there.
Lady Catherine gave them directions on the best method of packing and advised them on placing gowns in the only right way.
Maria had to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh when she



Summarizing: Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.I flatter myself, at least, that you will
be able to do so.Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent.Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage.My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking.There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us.We seem to have been designed for each
other.”Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprang.Poor Charlotte!it was melancholy to leave her to such
society!But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for
compassion.Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.He then handed
her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.[Illustration:“They had forgotten to leave any message”
]“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.”Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came!and yet how many things have
happened!”“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!

Summary: 
Elizabeth is a cousin of Lady Catherine and has been a witness to Lady Catherine's attentions to Mrs. Collins.
Elizabeth and Lady Catherine have a close relationship with each other, with Lady Catherine being a daily witness to her attentions.
Charlotte and Elizabeth are attracted to each other and share a commonality of character and ideas.
Both Charlotte and Elizabeth believe they are designed for each other



Summarizing: How much I shall have to tell!”Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s
house, where they were to remain a few days.Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them.But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals.To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister
further.[Illustration:     “How nicely we are crammed in”
]
CHAPTER XXXIX.[Illustration]It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“Is not this nice?is not this an agreeable surprise?”“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing
her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet.I do not think it
is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better.”And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable.

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Jane left Hunsford and arrived at Mr. Gardiner's house in Hertfordshire for a few days for observation.
Elizabeth is anxious to tell her sister, Jane, about Mr. Darcy's proposals and is apprehensive about revealing something of Bingley.
Kitty and Lydia are two girls who have been employed at a milliner's shop for an hour.
Lydia



Summarizing: Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.”“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer!It would be such a delicious scheme,
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all.Mamma would like to
go, too, of all things!Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!”“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once.Good Heaven!Brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to
table.“What do you think?It is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like.”Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay.Lydia laughed, and said,--“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion.You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared!I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say.But he is an ugly fellow!I am glad
he is gone.I never saw such a long chin in my life.Well, but now for
my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you!She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.Wickham is safe.”“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.“I am sure there is not on _his_.I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her.Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?”Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and
Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia.

Summary: 
The Shires have left Meryton and are going to be encamped near Brighton in a fortnight.
Elizabeth and Mamma want their papa to take them there for the summer.
Lydia has some news about a person they all like.
Wickham is gone and there is no danger of him marrying Mary King.
Mary King has gone to live with her uncle at Liverpool.




Summarizing: “I am glad I brought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box!Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home.And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away.Have you seen any pleasant men?Have you had any
flirting?I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back.Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.She is almost three-and-twenty!Lord!how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty!My aunt Philips wants you so to
get husbands you can’t think.She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.Lord!how I should like to be married before any of you!and then I would
_chaperon_ you about to all the balls.Dear me!we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s!Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!)and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun!Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked!When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least.Lord!how I laughed!and so did Mrs.
Forster.I thought I should have died.And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,
assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn.Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.Their reception at home was most kind.Mrs.Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”

Summary: 
Lizzy's aunt Philips wants Lizzy and Jane to get married before the age of three-and-twenty.
Jane is almost three and a half years old.
Lizzy brought her bonnet for the fun of having another band-box.
They had a good time at a party at Colonel Forster's where Kitty and Kitty dressed up in woman's clothes to pass for a



Summarizing: Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the
table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet
was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if
Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too.And then when we came away it was such fun!I thought
we never should have got into the coach.I was ready to die of laughter.And then we were so merry all the way home!we talked and laughed so
loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures.They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds.But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_.I should infinitely prefer a book.”But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme.It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.There was
another reason, too, for her opposition.She dreaded seeing Wickham
again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.The comfort to
_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
expression.In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents.Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.[Illustration]
CHAPTER XL.[Illustration]

Summary: 
Lydia and Kitty had fun pretending to be absent in the coach and treating the other three girls for a cold luncheon at the George.
The conversation took place in a large party in the dining-room discussing the news.
Lady Lucas was inquiring about the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter, Maria.
Mrs. Bennet was busy collecting information of the presentfashions from Jane



Summarizing: Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.
Darcy and herself.Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment.”“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”“Blame you!Oh, no.”“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very
next day.”She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham.What a stroke was this for poor Jane,
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual!Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything.Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one.There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much.For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.
Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.“Wickham so
very bad!It is almost past belief.And poor Mr. Darcy!dear Lizzy,
only consider what he must have suffered.Such a disappointment!and
with the knowledge of your ill opinion too!and having to relate such a
thing of his sister!It is really too distressing, I am sure you must
feel it so.”

Summary: 
Elizabeth and Jane Bennet are sisters.
Elizabeth has a strong sisterly affection for her sister, Miss Bennet.
They have a sisterly relationship where they share a strong affection for each other.
Mr. Darcy delivered his sentiments in a manner that was ill-suited to recommend to Elizabeth.
Jane blames her sister for not recommending him to Elizabeth and for her warmly speaking



Summarizing: “Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
of both.I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing
every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.Your profusion makes me
saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as
light as a feather.”“Poor Wickham!there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance!such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men.One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.”“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.”“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason.It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.”“Indeed, I could not.I was uncomfortable enough, I was very
uncomfortable--I may say unhappy.And with no one to speak to of what I
felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,
and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had!Oh, how I wanted you!”“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.”“Certainly.But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.There is
one point on which I want your advice.I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
Wickham’s character.”Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.What is your own opinion?”“That it ought not to be attempted.Mr.Darcy has not authorized me to
make his communication public.On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me?The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is
so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.I am not equal to
it.Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
anybody here what he really is.
