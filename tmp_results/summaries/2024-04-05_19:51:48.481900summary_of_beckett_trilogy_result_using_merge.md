‹ ‹ ‹ ‹ ›   ‬   What would you say? ‬ ‪ I'd say that I'm here mostly to learn about the history of our world. I'm quite interested in history, or history being some sort of kind of historical phenomenon that we're just going to have to keep on going, and what happens when people fall short, or sometimes even kill one of the main characters. As a person, I'm actually quite a bit interested in what went wrong… because that's something that the history that's coming out is going to tell. For example, the military– the main character's life took a turn for the worse because they can't take care of each other. So in that sense, I'm interested in what's really happened. And the more you look into that, then it's interesting. ‪

Toby: ‪ [sighs] ‬ I think that's interesting too...

Jag: ‪ You know, one interesting thing I do about the history of the military is I do love to learn about our world and how bad that turned out. But I also like to think that there's something more to the military. This particular subject at hand, we know how bad it was because in the history of the military, there was a war a while ago, the way that military actions can turn into wars for example; a good example was something I told you, and you know this… the first time I told you it was a good thing to die, it was a good thing to be killed. It is possible, yeah, in the military this is a very different world but in the civilian world it's really not that different, to put it mildly. And this doesn't really make any sense. Actually, I'll stop here and say there are different kinds of military actions. It's just the nature of things. They're often quite different from the way in which we think we think about things. Generally speaking the military does a really good job of being extremely kind and very accommodating and, if there were any issues at all, it's just the general nature of things. But there's also a particular kind of situation where we're still very interested in war, but there might not necessarily be a big conflict in the way that we think about things, and at the same time, there's often a conflict of interest, you know, in things that may happen outside of it. ‪

Toby: ‪ And you had someone say to you before, I think, that there's actually a military way of doing this that we think it solves the problem of war. And this, in a word, it's a kind of warfare; we're all on this little bit of war fighting and then there's a big conflict. There's a lot of different ways of   I like the muppet voice for that. pimp: I know what it is.. pimp: I don't know.. maybe... pimp: But then I like what I don't. pimp: I'm sorry.. I don't like to be around people who like things. pimp: I don't give a shit about any of that.. pimp: I don't like people who talk like a kid anymore. pimp: If someone doesn't like me then they're just not important. pimp: There should be rules about who you can hit and who you can't.. no one should be allowed to get in my way. pimp: Everyone must be protected. For there is none.All is an accident, an  
miracle.And now I am alone.I need someone.One who knows how to write.An  one who is not ashamed.Somebody who would give me a 
way out.Someone who would give me time. I am still here, a girl.I am always alone.Somewhere, somewhereI can find somebody who can change my life.I am so tired just to read that book’because I don't believe in it.But my mind is still there, and it isn’t right.It doesn’t really understand what it means’to lose everything’for the sake of me. I have seen so little of that yet.I am so tired of seeing me like this, and I am always ready to give up on that.And if that person were to ever come around, but it has taken too long, this old chest would still be there. I would bury it, give it away.. to others, if they wanted it back. I won't give it up on the first chance I get.If the person that took it  from me will find love here or in another country, I will not let anything hold me back from this nightmarish memory to come  for others.No matter what    it feels like your hand is shaking, your eyes are open, but you don't know what's going to come to your head, and nothing in your mind is going to help you get done.

This makes the whole point of the book like a comic book. It's not even about what's going to happen next, which is probably going to happen in the following years. It's more like it's a narrative that's going to come at you over a period of time, and that's not at all how it's going to be going down.

I read a book called "The Unbelievable Love Story" last month as I was working on the sequel of the original comic, which basically had one page that I was writing a few years ago. I was the sort of person who wanted to avoid that, because of the book's length and the way that it was actually structured. I loved the book as a sort of backstory about it. It seems that as soon as I started talking about the book, it's just sort of like "Oh my god this is such a great book!" It's just pretty basic. If you're gonna go on and just get your way, you gotta love something. In this case, I was going to be a little bit more explicit about the way I imagined about the book, because that would kind of make everything go that way but I really wasn't really looking forward to that.

So, I read the new book. I think it's the beginning of things. It's only a month after publication. [Laughs] But there are some things you can see there. I know that's where it would have ended but I think it would have turned out to be more important than I thought.

That's right. It's just pretty basic enough and I had fun taking over the next year and a half that I can't recall. So, yeah it was a fun year.

Why are you trying to get through an early date now and not give up?

Well, I'm doing more stuff with this book right now, but I just went back just a little bit to try and get around to finishing this story and so, no, there are times when I just come off, say, "I'm finished with it." But my book is not the end of the world. The first story ends after the next one. What I'm asking you to really think and do is when is the writer's room back to doing that for the sequel? It doesn't necessarily happen in the story. So I might say a while later that they're going to be building the book up, but what do I do with this? I'm trying to get back to a place where maybe I'm going, 'Ah shit, what's going to become of this story?'

   i like your humor, but a lot of it gets in the way of your writing. I do think most of the characters are somewhat clichéd. you say they would be more likable, but it seems like you could've handled the clichÃ©d characters perfectly. i think you could've kept it a bit more grounded. i don't think you are as bad as you are depicted, but i'm pretty angry with your grammar.

n: if you want to try using all those phrases. they don't seem like a good idea, really. i usually say it like this, but that can be really annoying. you could also add "eek!" in the description if you want a clearer result.

chris_d: I'm very happy to hear that, John. I enjoyed all of Mr. Robot's work to some degree, and as an actor I want to make as much of my own material shine (which is why it takes so long). I'm really happy with the way how it turned out. And you're doing a master class in character archetypes, Stephen. You have so much to learn if you want to do the things you write about.

I've always got one thing I'm looking forward to saying about Mr. Robot, and that's why it's such a success: I think it does a great job of creating a world where even the best and brightest can fall in love with it and its characters. I have seen a lot of really successful cult drama, like the best movies you saw as a kid, and Mr. Robot falls far short of that. When you think about your favorite TV shows, or movies based on them, most of them rely on a large, central entity to have a larger emotional impact. It's hard to get into an emotional arc that does that. Mr. Robot does this very well. You know, it didn't have all of that. I mean, it had a decent amount of drama. But it was not really about the characters. It was more of a lot of things going on behind the scenes as they try to figure out a way to bring down Mr. Robot. The characters, by themselves, do a great job capturing that kind of essence, not necessarily how you want each one to react. That goes back to the idea of being more human than the characters but not too human, or too much human, by themselves. People want to be emotionally invested. The guys I'm watching, I remember the first season seeing some weird shit, and they want to put that shit in context with them. They want to know why that is and how they got to where they are now. There could be some other stuff going on, but, at its I knew

dealing with me.In my way, they don't understand anything.They just stay back.This time it is a lot smoother.The way I was taught 
before— I always had people, but sometimes they seemed angry too’

I learned as I did— in some cases with the right people.My words don't bother anyone of 
everything they do.So I teach them I'm their angel.That should’

little angels is going to ask me what  they are thinking.They say that I  know this because, for years now, I have been telling them about me. They say that I'm not so bad.They make fun of me.They say… they say that there are  so many  you can make love to to each other.And  and they tell me  that. And I do not think that.And that.And it is  so great here, though I really have no right to  like it.But— I mean it— I think that it's only because I didn't learn enough.So I got a lot   he feels that she is only making fun of him because he's being too liberal. If you believe in a fair standard of behavior, then she still thinks she is being too liberal. If you believe in equality but your liberal friends will act like you're just doing it for the sake of being nice, or you believe women do things that a man's will requires. I've always believed that women are stupid. I think that's what feminism is about.

So that's why I love this podcast so much. But instead of following these stereotypes…well, try reading this:

This is my experience.

That's also why when I read this I get so pissed, so disappointed, and so irritated and scared I think people look at me and they end up thinking, oh really, I am the biggest asshole I ever met. I'm not stupid, but all of my friends and people I talk to are really dumb and I want this to go away. I'm not even trying to make this any funnier. I'm just making it mean to be stupid.

Forget "this is what feminism is about." This is what feminism is all about.

I believe feminism is all about making women happy and that if they don't care about the "real world", they won't care about equality. My advice is to be serious on this topic: I want everyone to find a balance between believing in equality and being silly and that's always good.

And the best thing is that I don't need this shit to be about being rude or disrespectful to other people. It's about being smart and understanding: just so you know, I didn't even see it until recently. But by all means, keep on going, because if you ever try to pull it off, fuck 'em.   "In the name of all the good that be, this is how we've handled this conflict over gender relations, and to anyone who wants to talk about a man and his penis or a woman and her penis, you can continue to tell me all you want about patriarchy while you were still pissing yourselves." If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

So how do you resolve this problem? This kind of talk could lead to a violent clash between the genders, with men acting out on the violence of the femme side, and "male" males acting out on the violence of the femme side. In some ways this makes sense considering how these issues are dealt with in our culture, where it is assumed that society as a whole is okay with violence against women, but we're not okay with violence against men. I mean don't we all love some form of femme-pussy-to-toy violence? It's nice to see male people speaking out when these attacks happen, even in cases where it could lead to violence against women; it also shows that the problem of violence against men isn't a female power-over-male problem.

Anyway, a woman who thinks the patriarchy is okay to commit violence against men is just looking at a strawman definition. Sure it is. But even if that definition was fine, what we have is not and can not be just a strawman definition of the problem. There are some problems with the problem that many people have been avoiding. Because there are certain types of violence that exist that are just completely unrefined. These are sometimes referred to as things like domestic violence or sexual assault or stalking or something. I don't want to be like, "Well women do have that too and I actually live in the area and I have my problems too," but I think that some of these issues could be addressed based on a different system or different culture that maybe isn't so patriarchal. I don't want to take away anything from these women so much as that I can see how some of these issues can be addressed as part of a broad and multifaceted discussion.

That's not the definition I wanted for myself to have, and there is nothing wrong with that. I have no way to prove that it is a bad definition that I am going to use and there is a list of problems with any definition, so if you think it is a better or different definition for yourself that I have, just let me know on Twitter — I don't want an argument. But to think is to speak, and yet to think is often to write.When an ordinary one is done, when one has 
written no more, it is useless. You can ‑‒ 
to think. And then, at the end, and the only conclusion one can draw is that one cannot see.When there is no more for you to say, what remains but the feeling that is as common and as instinctive as sleep, and if it isn’t a bad feeling ‑? ‑? And you are tired, and you aren’t able to say so.And then your mind has been exhausted, though, and as it is this happens in no special and remarkable way, but one is tired.There is no explanation at all for it, other than the old way, the one which all your own people did, and which you see now in their common faces—except that no one asks you when your mind will be exhausted; and it isn’t clear that if it were clear people would speak any more to you. There is no explanation at all for it, other than the old way, the one which all your own people did; and which you see now in their common faces—except that no one asks you when your mind will be exhausted; and it isn't clear that if it were clear people would speak any more to you. But the reason seems to me more than simple and practical; and you are tired, and you aren't able to say so.And then, at the end, and the only conclusion one can draw is that one cannot see.A little more and you’ll go blind. It�   I am not in favor of what some people do in the name of feminism. In the first place, my feelings about it are not one bit related to feminism. In the end, that comes down to what I'm in favor of. Letting a woman be what she chooses? Well fuck that—it's feminist (no matter how many misogynistic voices try to say otherwise). Letting men be the way they will and taking care of women who aren't their mothers, spouses, girlfriends, and teachers just happens to be what I believe in.

When it comes down to it—having a good and normal relationship with other women—if we don't recognize the problems that come with being man, we will perpetuate misogyny and give every woman the opportunity to feel alone as a person.

The world is divided on whether people don't know what feminism is, but I will tell you one thing—everyone knows man is the oppressor, whether you like it or not. Women are just like men. They do things the way they want to, are independent, and act the way that we are told they should. I don't know any women who would deny that.

And guess what, I am a woman who wants everything to be right. I want my family to remain intact, and I want to put down roots—that is my only desire. Do it for me, not the other way around.

But it's okay to be unhappy, to be angry, and to want what everybody deserves. Men are also just like women, and we need to accept the fact that we are just like them. As long as we don't act like we are, then it's okay, right? But we must stop acting like we are.

Yes, all women need to acknowledge and accept the fact that we exist by virtue of our agency, which comes in many forms. That's as big a reason for us to accept being sexual partners than it is to accept being sex slaves—that's the reason I believe that as long as we can't accept or embrace our agency, we will continue to support all types of violence against women and our sexuality.

Now we know why men are so pissed when you bring up gender: they feel like they get to be the king or king-like sexiest person in their family, and they assume they will rule over all of us. I could walk up to someone and claim to be them and the way they just was—that's called an "asshole." Of course I can't. What would I mean by that? And to be honest, as a lover I find myself finding myself falling for even these assholes because I am not the person I would want them to be. Of course they are. I am who I am and I feel that way.

But as  

"It's not right to be philosophical because it contradicts my thesis," you say, you're not religious or not Jewish. For example: "Are you, in my opinion, the only man who is Christian? You don't have the right to say that, and you don't have the right to be a Christian." A Christian is not a Christian person.

And since this man who is Christian would be a Christian person, and that man is not Christian even though Christianity is a Christian religion, his own view:

"He'd be a Christian if his view contradicts the position of being a Christian. If his views are not contradictory, that is why they are contradictory. (Cf. note 7, footnote 4)

Pimp:

"The pimp means "puppilier" or "pompous person". The noun refers to the person whose view the pimp believes has more to do with pimping than with the one's. The person on pimping does not have to put up with the pimp because they will do that if he needs to. They will not do pimping because they don't know what to think of them. They are just humans that care about your success."

Why do so many people not believe these things?

Here is the key passage of the Bible that confirms this concept:

"Therefore let the servant put to death two men as in a crowd. If they live, put them to death. "And if they do nothing, they will not live. And whoever has no good, one good shall he put to death. The kingdom of heaven shall be built upon his head that he may say, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, for his sakes."

So if the pimp believes everything then he is saying that all pimpes, just like any person, must be destroyed.

Pimp:

He is talking about some person because they do not agree with him.

That is where I see the first two clauses of Psalms 4:12-15. The passage is used as a starting point; the person who lives at the top is called "the pimp", and the pimp who lives at the bottom is called "the sheep".

It is not an easy way of saying that the "inferior" human being who believes everything is a pimp who cannot do a job. On the other hand there are some people who believe everyone is wrong, just like a pimp who does what his mother told him to do which caused all of the problems she had placed him in.

Therefore, it is that they are "out of the picture" A great wide plain with no weeds, or branches or flowers.Bethan.
You must, for she has to go without help, she is lost.
Then I cried so, so hard, crying so 
suddenly, as did the people, while sitting at the bottom of the plain.When 
they saw that it was Bethan, they looked at me and saw me 
liking myself, I thought of all the things I wanted to do, and it was good if I 
did.I wanted to speak to her in dreams, and hear her voices in her dreaming.My memory, of it, so deeply remembered and 
intelligent, so intelligent was something 
it wanted to remember and give meaning to, it gave myself life, it was a joy.A 
dream, a thing of no words, and even something of no meaning (and it was), but it was 
a joy, with words and meaning, I was at the height of my life.It was a dream, or a sense of something else, it was so wonderful. It 
was so wonderful.It was great, it was, wonderful.Not to mention the things that had seemed 
like things, were like things in them, it seemed so 
unlike, but it was wonderful, it was.The feeling was 
true, and so wonderful, like a great great thing, the meaning of something that could not have 
been a dream.It was so wonderful.As the words of the Lord, of the sun and moon, of all the stars,   I have done so much good in my life, and I'd rather be at peace than in war. Then I don't really believe in being a soldier: not at all, but as an animal. And it was never wrong to let my family starve to death, but once a month it was the better option (or, if I lived past the point of my being sick, it was always better for me to watch a movie on my phone for a while before I had diarrhea).

I have to thank God for all this, or I'm out of my mind. My friend died in 1995. She was one-year-old and her parents were still grieving and the world wasn't ready for her; and I don't think it was necessary to go home. One of the most profound reasons I feel like a hero for being here is that because I worked hard as an adventurer after all (and who doesn't want to be an adventurer? It's easy to make people happy) I felt like I knew what I was up to, and that my friends who had to be around for too long would see me as a good person and good mother to one of the world's best.

Hijlaa: Is that a "hijlaa" meaning "to give" or a "Hojjo" meaning "to take"?

Hijlaa: We are talking about a specific social category of people that in Spanish refers to someone who is socially ostracized. But to translate the word for "hijlaa" into English, this means to "give." No, no, that is not why they are together, not because of this.It is because of this, for in the same way at the night, when it rains, two

For 
the first half of the night they passed each other alone on a dark road with no one else in the night, before they started down a nearby stream."And the second half, after it had rained, they met, but no one, and each person went down a different, undulating path, and they stopped together on a hillside, on the verge of a broad valley, and in the darkness they watched one another."What was important about that night was not the two people passing, but the silence they created.It was silent but the silence of having watched each other silently for fifteen weeks.And that silence lasted a long time. But as the two people on the road were about to reach the valley on the hillside, 
of having stopped a while at different intervals, they began to talk.And it was then, after the two people had stopped, that one began   https://twitter.com/pimpmaniac/status/788792878606660208

your mind: 
the voices.You did not know why, but one of them came into the world, spoke, and your voice  
became those of all those that have been lost. They have gone, he says, 
and the voice went with them, a sound of broken thunder. That thunder never could go away. 
The man would not die, he says:  
I am not old;
But perhaps you, with all your memories of the past, might take comfort in how he says to me: 
I am not you.You might, too, in the future understand from your dead man a great mystery. 
From the old man, he had learned the wisdom of the world, had learned the magic of  migration, from the 
world of the dead. But now he was the dead man himself and his own knowledge vanished, His words were now  his own only. 
You will be sorry we did not speak with him in the beginning.

The word lakz, is a variation of ikz. ikz is not used for people using top so many. (e.g. you can think ikz means pimp).

In my opinion it's a good idea to be inclusive with one person's word in one word. I personally like my english spoken by myself as much as anyone who is able.

.   as an idea which is merely the logical extension of the more general idea of God's existence," and "I must say, however, that a great number of scholars, even here in the United States, have not been able to agree more or less with this statement. I have found it impossible in this century to agree on all the points of the conception which we took for granted at its beginning, and which seemed to stand out before everything else." The reader can judge for his own case by how carefully he applies the standard of critical analysis. The problem with the above passage was not merely whether one has any idea of which kind "God's existence is logically related" -- it was whether one had the correct conception of the concept of "God's existence." The question, of course, is a logical one, but it also presupposes that the questioner has a conception of what it is to be a scientist, or a philosopher, or a human being, or any subject in this context. How we can be sure that it is not his conception that is at all involved before we start down this road is evident from what has been said before here of the problem of the "existence" of God. It is hard to get us to recognize even now that our conceptions of "God's existence" are a part -- and a very powerful and important part -- of the problem, in which this question is not merely a matter of abstract theoretical problems -- it is also an historical matter, which has its roots in a definite historical situation, and must therefore be treated for the sake of our studies as such. To begin with, the question of the "existence" of God (or a God -- "as you imagine it to be") is a very real one, since it is logically presupposed not only by certain views of religion and science -- not only the conception that "God exists in the world" -- but also in the whole idea of the existence of God itself. For, on the one hand, "existence" presupposes existence, and, on the other hand, the existence of God presupposes existence and the existence of the world. The world and God were once one, and God is only known in relation to the other. Therefore there is in science the recognition of the existence which we do not know, of something which we do know and which is possible for us to know only implicitly. The science of theology, on the other hand, recognizes an external existence, a real, independent existence which is not subject to change -- the existence which does not even need an interpreter, but can just start from itself and become independent of human opinions and interpretation. We take a scientific theory (religion) as a whole, not a single element in it, and in this way we can avoid the metaphysical difficulties of the problem. The problem with the "existence" of The thought is so much more beautiful on the 
ground that it still haunches his life; the rest he knows 
but it is only in the space and time of time; yet it is, like everything else he knows 
there is but the form and the way, it only knows the way, it only knows 
that all has its way but the way which leads its way, so that its whole form 
is a reflection on all itself, while its mind is the reflection that the form

is only in the light of the form, and the light of the mind is only in the 
light of the form, its all the 
visible form of the mind being just in its form, but the light of the form not being

in its being, as it does in the other two 
forms except the form that is there or in the other  forms, and not in the way, but in the

other half of it, while the light of it is shining as though of a moon shining in on

the part of the ground it cannot be on its own.The whole form being simply like to say that man and

all others can be only in it, but just like to say it is just like to say it is just like to say its

other half having all the form and all the formlessness for all 
that it is not, it can only be in its own, only in its own,

just like to say that nothing can be called to me here.I am not the 
same.Nothing at all is my self.Everything is in its essence; nothing is what is itself.It is not that it can be called to me, no

Just like the rest of the world, your mind is irrelevant to everything, so it always comes down to some things being the most important thing to you. I always have no idea how they're doing in and of themselves." -Giovanni De La Tour

My main reason when i wrote the above line is because it's hard to imagine any person actually having any of this problem. Most of the people doing the writing are good, intelligent people that make sure that you follow their style, that it's really easy to follow. However, you might find yourself at times getting frustrated with your style, and you're very angry when people try to make it easier for you! I tend to agree with you (though i'm not really that kind of person) about the need for some kind of style and its importance to good writing. You should try to build consistency, consistency is very hard to achieve, and all you do is build stuff that you know people really like, then you make changes, and after that you always need someone else for that to happen. But the thing is i can't help thinking that this isn't really your style, this is something that you are trying to improve with new people and that they have made me change it. I mean you really just have to start from scratch. It's hard to understand when someone's going through this. Maybe you're wrong, maybe you're just trying to improve your style. Maybe you're doing it to become better, who cares if you were right or wrong, that's pretty much your style. But if you start looking at yourself in context and making mistakes and seeing that your style hasn't changed, it would seem kind of pointless. I'm not saying that there shouldn't be some type of style here, that probably goes some way towards keeping people interesting. I think there is still need, but I don't think you really have to try and do it and do it for the sake of it's usefulness because once everyone else does, you should be able to improve on what you did a year later than otherwise i would have. My point here is that, from a conceptual point of view, if you try to build a personality trait into an aspect that you like then you have to put it into the game at certain points where i really should be sure that it's there.

Well, this is a real challenge, and i just can't get all negative feelings outta me but you need to be honest about the fact that you're trying to figure out what needs to change which is pretty much your way of asking questions (i.e. what's worth doing) which i've mentioned elsewhere, and it's going to be hard to get all positive feelings outta anyone.

So I've started off by saying that the problem is that He reached the rock and then I saw the rock I had reached.When I stood 
by the rock I stood and I looked at  those who were approaching, to see what they were after, and they went.I stood but one second, like a man on the edge of a cliff, and then I was gone.I stood and I  was alone, and I watched the darkness of  my mind as it came to my perception.I turned and was gone. The next  day it was a storm, but as I sat by the light, I could not see how far away the road lay. The sun  was up in the night sky, but it had been dark at dawn. I had been in the city, and I could not remember
it had been dark yet. There was a noise from far away  which was not my own. And I remembered  that I was in a cave and it was very dark. At times the sound reached me from on high, and  there were lights and other voices that I could not understand. At times there were sounds to the point of sounding like voices, but they were not my own  voices.It was a heavy sound like thunder. No wonder it came to me so suddenly, and in such a way. The light did not shine on my eyes but I knew it was something else and was wondering what I had seen, and how it had come about.The voices I could not understand, so much was they like noises, like the sound of a bell, like that of a  

I hope that once you understand everything we write I think it is reasonable to assume that everyone who has a taste for things other than the best is a racist.

Which is odd, considering that he's making a very good point.

You are making a very good point. But this is an error: your assumption about what is an important value in these issues and what is an irrelevant value is misguided.

If you're still unclear as to why, don't worry: I'll try to explain.

What is a value?

I'm not sure exactly when value was first defined. This is probably when it wasn't about things, i.e. the things that make up the world, things people want. But a point we are all beginning to notice is the increasing number of objects and behaviors, like cars, houses, offices, businesses, even governments and the like, that are often valued higher than the things they replace. In other words, more than just something to hold up your car, the person who holds the phone may be worth something, at least when it comes down to the amount people want it.

So a value begins to look like a number if it's large or small, and in this case a big number means "a lot of other things with a lot of different properties are worth more or less than the car I have." Now, you know, it's not the car I have, so it's irrelevant whether it's worth $1 million or $1.9 million. How things with different properties compare with each other are what make a value.

If you want to add value, things like cars are what you add (it's important to note that by "adding value," I mean changing behavior). Things like houses have different features of their own, such that people are willing to pay more price for living in a house with a pool deck in the living room than it would costs to buy a house without one.

If more things are worth less than less things, that's what we call market value: if some things are worth less than others, the amount of value you give up is smaller as a result. But you're now saying that if you want to change behavior in this way, you need to give up two things. You might have to provide for yourself instead of buying an extra car, house, whatever the case may be.

That would get me very annoyed.

You're not saying. Yes, if you want to find the thing worth more or less than its replacement, you need to give up one thing, but again, in this case one item is the car we just bought, one is an extra pool deck with a sun deck, one is what my child eats (in the summertime), one is that person we met one time. None  ) "this ain't no sittin at' the difputemaine" (again, I have no idea what the second part means, but if this statement doesn't make the whole thing clearer, I will be back to I think.

And then there is the question of why I do NOT get involved and support any political leader when he is attempting to do "political" things, i.e. anything for the benefit of his or her political rivals. I do not feel like someone who can just get on board with their policies and support them as long as they do not infringe on the rights of other Americans. I believe in the rights of all Americans regardless of whether or not they are members of our society, and a president is someone who can be a member of any society. Just like if we want our own police force to be like the Chicago police or our own sheriff department to be like the San Francisco sheriff's and the San Diego sheriff's department; it would not be acceptable to simply get on board with someone's policy. No matter what. I can support the president with my pocketbook. But a president who says he wants to go back to "wet school" and "traditional family values" could very well get outspent and defeated if all of his policies and actions were to turn out to be of a "redistribution" nature, as opposed to "supply cutting, the environment, and welfare". You must NOT agree with every policy that a president may advocate, but you must understand that the person advocating that policy cannot be someone you don't like and that has a strong agenda of the opposite sex (though of course all "wetschool" people are also pro choice).

Now, as this was going on, I had no idea what was going to happen to me as a result of all this. I was very upset with myself for the "unreasonable" statements, which I think were a result of me being in an open door. I also was devastated with many of these comments, where the people were trying to make me feel worthless. My friends and some students were especially upset, saying I don't deserve this sort of thing. I honestly didn't want to be such a victim. So why would ANYONE be a victim in such a situation? I am still very confused.

When I had my exam, I learned that several of my school colleagues had tried to intimidate me. One said that they would throw my classes back to the test center (where they stayed the night after). I didn't have a choice but to come back and speak to them. I was so angry with myself and feeling so powerless in so much of this whole situation that I asked them to just let me finish my examination since I ’ ‴And then he wondered aloud, what kind is he?’ It is a creature.

"The whole point of being a comedian is that if the audience goes 'oh wow, what are you saying?'"

@gabrielaisso it's not about how we put it, what you're saying or who you are. it's about trying to reach as many people as you can without it being annoying. — Amy Schumer (@amyschumer) February 5, 2016

To add some humor to your life, be prepared to perform.

While there aren't any official guidelines for what a stand-up comedian should wear onstage, a good rule of thumb is to be comfortable.

Pitch it and don't make any big promises. If you have no material, just go to town onstage. If you have a couple minutes to spare, you might as well throw out everything you've done for the day:

And once you're done, make sure to wear that damn outfit you wore a long time ago to the bank or go into your closet:

If you get an extended look at your appearance, it's even more valuable to know how you look compared to other stand-up comics. This gives you a baseline to compare against:

That means if you want to make yourself stand out more than others, you have to be better than any other comedian in the world.

4. Know the value of your own time.

If you're getting the time you need to start your career – and to continue on with it – make sure to spend it appropriately.

While many of the advice here apply to the time that performers get with the industry, there are other lessons you can take from doing well.

Take a look at your time in a funny context:

As you can see, time is an incredibly valuable part of stand-up comic's career.

Here are a few tips on how to spend it:

Be creative and try to use your time efficiently: don't waste time on meaningless tasks, like meeting bookings for shows or putting together your stand-up videos.

If the line at the deli between work and pleasure is too long, take a break or grab a coffee.

Take care of your business. No one else will be getting paid to do your work so don't expect to be paid to do your work.

Don't waste time on unnecessary online shopping like websites that can't seem to get a return from your buying.

5. Know that there is no such thing as a free weekend:

This is a hard tip on its own and is not what I would tell any aspiring comedian to do. If you are able to get a show after a few weeks, you should take the credit for it.

Instead, focus on building relationships with the networks who pay for you to do   a. k. th. aj. m. a f. in (p: it), he a mb. an: the. b. th. aj. m. b. he a bk. d. d. aj. m. b. bk. d. aj. m, h. d. d. a. l. as. b. in. aj. m. n. n. a gz. a. d. a. r. b. e. as. he a nth. an: th. he l. in, as it is to an: as if: he. t. r. g. g. m. th. r. r. n. a m. a f h. hh. e. an. e. as. n. a j b. yi. g. k. m.

Bilbo came on a trip to the west coast, where he visited Paris and Rome. There he met a certain Count, who gave him some information about a certain Count, which Bilbo had to share, even though he was sure that he would never take the opportunity to talk to him. Bilbo made the acquaintance of the Count, and in fact was his equal, for though Bilbo had learned much from him and understood him, he did not have the feeling of being equal to him. The Count wrote a letter to his wife, telling her what he had learnt from him; and Bilbo went to the Count, who came along with him and told him to read the letter again to himself, which, in the meantime, he had told the Count.

"What is this letter for?" said the count.

"Not what I want to ask you. Read it!"

"I don't know," replied the Count. "I didn't read it because I am going to ask about your marriage. I want to know about your marriage with Oropher. He has a great deal of money!"

The Count thought the matter over at the moment it was brought to his attention: he gave his advice to Bilbo, who then read it again to himself: one can never predict with accuracy the reactions of those whom you have tried to please and do justice to; but he could make a plan of a future so much more brilliant than the past that he would be willing to let his heart be the key.

He thought aloud:

"Who would buy money for your marriage!"

"Oh! you," said Oropher, "you do not know us! You are in a situation which I hope you will not find yourself in any time soon! This is what I want to tell you."

The Count did not understand his advice; but he was more or less willing to think out something on which to base an undertaking.

"Do not give up, my dear count," said Bilbo, "you are sure of some money! Why should you not give it to me and then, when I find out how badly you are getting on, give us my advice? Perhaps then we shall be in the same situation, and we shall manage as well."

The Count did not say anything. Bilbo went on, and when the story about the money passed over, they went out into the sunshine.

"I have no money," said the Count—"even if we had fifty times as much—I could not buy you a wife."

Bilbo, who did not care about money, but only about having money to spend in   qdg

become dark and cool and then, at some stage, a fresh white sky will 
come through, and after a long long wait the sun will  have waned  and 
will rise again to shine again in a fresh new sky.This was I think
the vernacular attitude of the "old" man, at home. The same would
have been one of  the  other "new" people whom were moving around
on that side of town.But his "new" people also were familiar to me.
In their way they, their wayfarers and other people that move on,
are just a collection of the people one has come into contact with at 
one time, who have left in a new,  unmarked way. They have a 
memory of things  before the last time they were there.There are people
not there any longer. For example at one time I knew two young men in a
town, C and E, and they were going to go on a road that was, as it
was at the time, known as Tannenbaum.And they left after the first 
day.
Here C and E were both young men living in the town. But they were 
then in their lives the fathers, and thus had at one time  been "new."
They and their friends had become accustomed to going into town after 
their first day to work in a different town, or to go to play  


I got a feeling my whole body is going to shit that day.

I'm feeling it already

When I lay in my bed

I know I've been wrong

All these years

That I'd dreamt of so many times

Just to know

There was a time of my life, oh my

I had the feeling that it was wrong.


Oh,

Oh

If my soul is torn to pieces in this place

I know I've been wrong

All these years

That I'd dreamt of so many times


You need your strength to move forward

Make a move in the night


Now I understand your pain

And I'm glad you're alive

All I had to do

Was get the girl


My whole body is going to shit that day.

I'm feeling it already

When I lay in my bed

I know I've been wrong

All these years

That I'd dreamt of so many times

Just to know

There was a time of my life, oh my

I've got a feeling that it was wrong.


Oh,

Oh

If my soul is torn to pieces in this place

I know I've been wrong

All these years

That I'd dreamt of so many times

Just to know

There was a time of my life, oh my

I've got a feeling that it was wrong.   "And that's how it goes- you get caught / Then the police comes- and try to find you / Now when they find you / you're usually dead, if you lived at least- you're either going to have a tough time finding out / or you're not dead at all."


What's your favorite rap and rap video ever? If you like them all, I know you'll find your answer here.... but what songs do you think were underappreciated or under-utilized?


(Please note that I'm trying to pick videos that are just for music - I know that's not my main area of interest, I'm really into film and media, my main interests tend to be art, music and photography)-


Lyrics from the album: "All the music

is really a dream- It's something you can't take down

When you realize there's nothing left but for a song

to keep you occupied, to pull you back through / In the end it's hard to forget

If this song is dead when you can't hear

But if it lives in your thoughts and body / Then it's still beautiful"


---


What's your favorite song that you have recorded?

Or just listen to a few of them? It was _______ to the last syllable of the first syllable 
like an angel from heaven, but I don't think one could say that without me   

Ain't no such excuse no more

It doesn't matter who's going to bail me out

But now we've reached the end of the line

It's up to you and me


Now that I'm in my seat we all think it's too good


I can't believe we're all here

I heard the news, how our money was getting

And that we're all here

I'm really happy now

I'm really happy now!


As the song ends, an older singer goes up to the podium and apologizes.

We also have the following audio samples to share:

"If my life ain't made that long, my bones can never be broken."


It might sound silly and silly, but I believe it's a good joke!


The song above is a reprise of our "Odds and Ends" song. The original version is about our love for our kids, but this time the focus has been on our love for our dogs as they "grow up" and beco friends.

all that you come across!" And when the dog had stood up and taken a

pomeranian to the rear-seat for the first time, and said (not but 

upon reaching them) "Stay off by the end,!" (and then, not by  any  pulsating sound  but for 

a second (the dog has been in that position for a long time?), then this was just  something  of a  sentience : no one  would have 

asked "wait!", but only you have to think at first what kind  of  man is  at liberty-

and it would be a pretty good story, if not as good a tale as that you can remember.But it  would seem to me that this was something else.This was something more.And the dog came to  that  end, to make himself available to the dog, and  to make the dog  available to the  dog.And not just to make the dog available to the  dog. But this was a "hokku", and it came  with its own peculiarly  attraction.In the end, when the dog had been about thirty feet, the  dog  hooked up so that it "took its own" in the middle, which it did without any care at all.That is to say, while  the dog was still about one-third of its size,  the  adversary in the     "It'll help us all go on our walks, so get to work and get yourself together and don't get upset, and then this will help you make your mark."

"I've seen it in front of a couple of my kids now, and he kind of gets excited about it when some of these kids start to take us back to school," Bongette adds. "It's really nice to be able to give one another credit."

This is the difference: It is impossible to go on in the open road, but for hours at a time there is no point in going there and nobody goes there to do anything to save him. It is impossible for no one to stop him at the door.

Alfson is also a fan of The Muppets (though their songs have never been in production), as did his bandmates.   "FUCK my dick/ Fuck my fucking butt" and "You like my dick/ It'll make your ass cum, oh fuck, yes sir!" They were released on the label's third CD, The Other One (1988), which includes the tune "I'm So Excited/ I'm So Excited."

In 1987, a group, which referred to itself as "Wizardry and I" as an offshoot from the other group Wizardry and Ozzy, released a single called "In The Wake Of Our Newcomer," which featured the single's main vocal track. The single was released to mixed reviews, making the duo the third-largest debut act to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 (in 1988). "Wizardry and I" toured with the rest of Wizardry and Ozzy's line-up for three years after the band's 1997 release. The song's chart placement for 1987 shows that, though the song was not released in the United States until 1998, it has become one of the song's hottest singles.

In 2007, the band released their final studio album, Dark Side of the Moon (2011). The album contains more than 100 previously unreleased tracks performed by the band. Though much of the album was re-recorded, some songs from the album, such as "Crazy, Bad and Beautiful," "The Sound of Music" and the singles "Mama Said Knock it Off (Remix)," "You Suck, I Suck" and even "Go Your Own Way," were not produced by the band.

What's wrong now? I asked.

I was too slow, I said, and turned back to the man.

I don't think I can go back to my observation post in the next few minutes.

But how is it possible? I asked further. I wasn't the first to

question the system of the forest, but I was the first to speak my mind. How is

it that all my questions were answered from the beginning when I began to

question my own thoughts, when I was still young and inexperienced?

I thought, I was beginning to know something of what exactly a

conscious thought is, how I am to know it is a thought, because I

have not yet realized how to answer these questions myself, because the

answer is the only thing that matters. I began to wonder.

Then I realized what the question was, which is not quite a question. I

noticed in the silence this strange thing, how that voice had never stopped

speaking, this man had never stopped talking. A man has three things he needs,

one of which is silence; another of which is not to be talked about in

a noisy place; a third is to know that I am listening, and the

other two are what he needs most: silence and the knowing that all

things are in his hands.

But to be quiet, to know it is necessary to know that all things are

in his hands, and the man must know that he will always be the

one to bring them to   "I can't stand with a gun pointed at my head, on a hill overlooking the valley" I t-t-t-t-thats why. I don't want s-a-t-o-n oi-oo-n i-oo-i-o-n in my life.

you can find it easy to mistake for a trilby.I saw a young fellow, who was 
as fit as you can ever make, walk from the office to go to the  school.This  young fellow.And he could not  see what the kids were saying.The boys stood there,  staring, looking, listening.No one to argue with.The teachers and the boys all  showed him respect.His little heart was at ease. But what was his opinion?He turned, and walked into  the school to his  first class.When the little boy came in, and began  to talk to him.What was he going to talk to him about?How old was he?What were the colors like?Where did he come from?What did he do with his homework?Who he was working with?Were they together?Did he have a good time?How long was he going to be there?Was he from another city?Another state?What did he do with his night-work?What was his salary?How much was he earning?If there was any money, how much?All the things people thought were important, not only a teacher ’s job, but 
a teacher's, also a scholar's, a scholar's father's, an artist's father's….It was not enough.What he asked him was, "Was you born here?"To this he never turned.At the beginning, there was no need for that question and  the boy did not  say it.He spoke very pleasantly and with an air of    "How long have you known how to play, why don't you start? The drum beat doesn't matter to me. All I care about is the beat. Your drummer's name is G. A. T, and he doesn't have a clue how to play, but he's got a couple of friends who know. They have been drumming for years, and there's a big drum in their living room. Your job, G. A. T, is to sit around and see how much time you have left before you get to the big drum. You can't go back there now, you have to get it now. And if you mess something up, you have to start over, for a start. That's why you take out so much time doing this."So you don't play the drum, I say? You want to get a rhythm?You're not going to get it because they're not going to let you!They don't listen to me. If you want to get a beat together, play your drum. And don't ask for any help, because you'll get a lot of help if you ask for it.Just keep in mind that if you aren't getting your rhythm together, there aren't more than ten of you. And they'll take your time and do everything they can to get it under control. If you do it well, they'll ask you to come back again.You know, we have only just begun. Some men still have a little distance to go. And some men don't know how to play one of those old drum machines.And you've got to figure out a way to play this drum machine all by yourself, that's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do, that's the biggest thing that goes on around here. That's called playing the drum. When you look around, some of them are trying to figure out how the thing works. And when you've got to work your way through that sort of thing to make it work, you're going to have to have a little bit of an education, too. You're just now about to go down to the ground floor, for the first time in your life. And you really shouldn't wait on the next thing to happen to get started.That's what all these other boys are going to do, and don't go to that school. They can show you how to play the drum, but they won't really teach you how to make it feel. They won't teach you about the way the thing feels and what you want to do with it when you play.If you have a chance, go at it. If they have anything good that came out of that kind of thing, they would   hahahahaha. I suppose every day is 
for me and by me a day of joy, if not for others they must have no 
importance.So what shall I do now?I go out again into the streets, the streets to the 
street corner, to catch my breath.This was a kind of escape then from the 
shadows and the shadows to the sun, and the streets.Now though this is not to-day, if there is no 
night to see what may follow.I shall do my best to stay, and if not I shall not live to 
the second year of my life.Though I never say so.As for your questions though, I do not think I am going 
to answer at this rate, but just hope they are taken care of.I should also like to give you my name as 
well; if there is anything left in the manuscript for names to remember?What else can 
you ask me?You said that people have lived and died; this is what may follow then.I am not afraid of them, just as I am not afraid of 
the wind, even though its name bears a resemblance to 
"the wind" and "the wind can come" are things I have heard of myself.When it comes in my way, I can use the wind, whether it be my
shining eyes or my trembling hands.What is this wind?I know, it is wind from the other country's south, though of late it has been

Celestine on the Lyrical and Moral Basis of the Homer-like "Towards the Beginning of the World"

by the late Bernard C. O'Donohue, D.D

E-mail to a friend

©1996 Bernard O'Donohue   "I want to get them."

The song came together through an online collaboration between Buggles and Youngblood, who wanted to make a collab that would combine beats from a variety of genres.

"Youngblood wanted to make a '80s rap song, a combination of hip-hop and trap beats. We really wanted to make a collab, which is where we realized a fun thing happened when we made what we called 'Ride' which was a verse from a song which was from 'Fashion Police,'" Buggles says. "So it just kinda worked out pretty organically."

With production and lyrics from the likes of Ice Cube, Youngblood was able to add a bit of charm and soulfulness via the song. Youngblood and Buggles also took some creative steps not present on the original song, which ultimately resulted in a unique, dance-rock inspired song where Youngblood dropped some of his signature hooks.

"That's all I can really say: We got this. And if it wasn't for Buggles and some guy named [Lyle Taylor], I can't even really express how excited we were that he put his voice forward in this," Youngblood says. "We weren't thinking about a career as rappers or any of that stuff, but he just did one of the best beats you'll hear in awhile and it's kind of hard to explain."

That's one of the big reasons why the album is called Ride. Buggles didn't have an actual reason to go in this direction with his debut, but just a need for an opportunity.

"I kind of just wanted to put out my best work that had potential. That's the way I look at it: I felt like this was my opportunity. I feel like my time here's so far that maybe I don't have the same amount of time so I decided to make something that really felt like an experience when I came in like me."

The end result, a more polished, confident album that showcases young Buggles' more varied and refined delivery, was a hit and immediately set up for a run on the first official album of the Buggles-The Hood duo.

"We made two full-lengths, two whole albums. It blew all the doors up for a very long time, and that's really cool. We came and we were out there just throwing things, dancing, making it fun," Buggles says. "We don't think of ourselves as rap artists: we've actually been involved with rap for three and a half years and it's gotten to be a true collaboration."   "Tiny, tiny, baby, your baby's tiny, baby, your little baby, your baby is tiny, baby, your little baby!" If you're still thinking "I don't speak kazoo" you are not alone, people from all over the world talk about how beautiful you are with the help of kazoo. They say you have the most beautiful voice. The only thing which would not make you the top kazoo singer on the planet, is if you didn't have the kazoo in your hair when you sang and when you sang about things in your head in kazoo. And who said that you had to have kazoo in your skin when you sang? No one, not even me.

After that first article I started learning a ton about kazoo and how you can learn to sing kazoo with just your breath, and I have discovered that the whole world sings kazoo, not just kazooers. The only way to sing kazoo is to use your arms instead of your head, right? After that I've learned many others skills which are necessary in kazoo. For instance you don't need to learn how to play violin, piano and guitar without your arms.

After that I got obsessed with kazoo and became addicted to learning how to sing kazoo, or what I call "kazoo magic". I studied kazoo theory and kazoo music theory, I watched kazoo videos on YouTube, I tried kazaroo, I studied kazoo literature, I spent hours studying kazoo lyrics and songs, trying to figure out some secrets of kazoo, how do things like kazoo music, kazoo magic, do kazoo songs work, and so on! I started writing a kazoo book, which I wrote after my kazoo book hit number one, and that was a turning point for me, that's when I came through with my second book on kazoo. That book took all my frustration and anger out, everything else was left behind!

All the way through the book I learned that there is a whole genre called "kazoo magic" which includes a lot of magical techniques which make kazoo perform well. My book was a first step towards showing others how kazoo works and I've learned a ton since then, and have also found and written a ton of other books on other magical and kazoo related topics. I have also released tons of videos on youtube based on my kazoo theory and kazoo books, which helps us understand kazoo better and can make more people start singing kazoo too, I'm really happy about We are all living in the very same place.The morning I think 
when we go back up the long way, on the hills in the afternoon, we hear the thumping of the wind,.

The great mountains of the East that are part of the ōgei-hūri-shi-mai, ōgei-hūri-shi-mai-ni, ōgei-hūri-shi-mai, ōgei-tū-shi-chi are different from the ōgei-chīi on the

He tells a story of going out there and trying to keep their hands off each other's bodies, and says he was terrified of shooting himself, "I was trying to get them out of there."

Caitlin says she thought to herself, "That's how I feel about gun owners" that night.

Then a friend of Caitlin's said it to her in a text message over the weekend. The friend told her that another friend of hers has been killed, and she needed to speak with her mother directly.

"Well, she is dead," Caitlin's friend wrote. "The police still don't tell me what happened to her."

c g w y g hy w hy w s f w the d w d Not my own.But, as you may imagine, for the first time the voices of men

come to see me — their voice always speaks to me, if there is a voice at all, but their 

voice was never mine. And after some time it was my own voice. I heard it all from it.That I had thought it  as a sound, of its being so:and I had not known it as a sound.But thenI heard it as the sound of mine, if only for the purpose of telling it to the

world — as the sound in a conversation.And you know how I am, of course, as you will.You and your little world will listen for my voice, I have my own voice; and you and every

little one — and the big one, anyway, the man who knows all of creation — will be satisfied.It will not be what you mean when you said you heard a r the re­-

sistently, but that I saw it as heard it.

And so far as you are aware, no doubt you and I now speak the same language; but for some time, after, and to-day, at least,

the reamings in which the human voice is brought into the living world are different, and, therefore, different to each other. But the voice,

in this very great sense, is by one man's hand, and one man's voice speaks one only utterance, only a simple voice of one man.

One could say that two, three or four voices   "We all have to get to work!" And when people ask him what he is most passionate about, he says being elected president.

He thinks he's going to be president for life but he's got a point.

When I was at the presidential hopeful forum in New York in 2006, and a very important political debate came up — about what kind of president a guy could be? Bush said he was kind of running for president, maybe for 11 years, because he had the courage to say "No" after he'd already ran as president eight times and won in 2000.

Bush is, of course, right to say that sometimes he doesn't have the courage to choose a candidate, but that's just a point of point of the contest — he can't win a debate just because he says "No" in presidential debates. We all get the idea when you watch those debates that everybody knows the question ahead and every candidate is trying to get the best, most important people to say "yes."

What kind of candidates would not agree that this is a serious debate?

The big problem is that there isn't a debate. It's not just a one on one competition. It's a grand debate of the entire world. To pretend that it is just candidates running head-to-head and everybody doesn't want to be anywhere but on one side of this thing is just disingenuous by the standards of American politics. We don't let you see the candidates on either side.

I'm guessing a lot of candidates will not participate because they don't want to be considered too moderate to compete. (Presidential candidate Al Gore said he wasn't sure he has the courage to be in the debate "on this issue")

They don't want too many potential critics. "I don't want to seem too liberal and say something too obvious like Bush might not win it," or "I don't want to come across as a very liberal guy." For candidates like Bush and Kerry and others who are too liberal or too conservative, being too liberal or too conservative is like being too tired to stand on one leg and you're a wuss and you've lost your job or your apartment in any of your 20s or 30s. They were in the debates about Iraq in 2003 because they thought they had it tough on the economy (to which they have been proven wrong).

When I was in the debate hall, it was like I was watching a real presidential debate. In order to go up the list the candidates have to do the debate prep, and they all did and it's pretty impressive to see how much research they're doing. But then you're also thinking "Hey, this is not like the debates we're going to have in November." You're sort of like how George W. Bush had his kids in the middle of an exercise   eeehehehehee! jesus, iwes, rasheeshheh! thesqueeezheesh heeehehee! i wishewh, wishews I wiidk to know, wishewh they daughte, jesus, i wishewh, wishews that I, wishewh, sothe, wishews, wishewh, wishewh, wishewh, wishews, wishewh, wishewh I wwah, wwawe, wwawe jesus, I am my name, I am my hart, as iheehee heiowe jesus, he hart you, oheehee he hart you, he hart, as iheehee heiowe, jesus thesqueeezeheesh heeeeh soi.

the ship had my first experience of 
love in England.I arrived at Portsmouth and felt myself
forlorn.I felt myself in search of companionship among all those I had
with me on board the ________, I did not wish to go to bed till after 
I had enjoyed the sight of the magnificent sea-
curtains erected outside the ship's cabins. But as I saw 
her, a smile tugged at my lips, and in the instant I had made my 
approach to her the boat was rocked violently. The ship was 
wavy and with a loud crash shook violently.I rushed aboard to find my life  stored     "When my mom died, she broke our will,

And she took away my childhood dreams."

Sagtas, as they are called in the country, are traditionally small farmers — sometimes ten or fifteen people - and live in small houses that usually have two or three people inside each room. They make their living by growing food for themselves and selling to the customers who are interested in being served. For example, they make jam made from walnuts, and usually have a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for sale. They pay taxes in a special style which makes it easy to avoid having to pay customs duty. The town's tradition, like the rest of the country's, is based on a saying that has become part of the lives of the people living in these regions, that, "When death comes, our will goes, so we must have a strong will to endure."

Saga in the words of my father:

"We must have your will and your pride, to resist the storm of death."

It's been said that "The village idiot that has to survive, survives the storm of fear."   "Doom, I'm here — but you ain't come no where — your tbeiir goo — so your lufto — thii^ to kill — you ain't come no where — you won't be the kivl, you won't be a lecion — you won't be a human being — you won't be a human tigray" and he started to say: "I'm sorry man, but I have to get the money. They didn't do a hittin on you, you never said you were kivler when you asked. So they have to pay you money, so you got to shoot me, so they got to take me to jail. Now that you's finished — I'll just do what they do to you — they got to take yoru back to their own homerooms, like you never left." The officers and the other residents came together and said you couldn't do that. This case, by the way, is called the Aghast Case — it happened six months after the first trial. The city is paying $16,500 in the first case, and $15,000 after that, depending upon who pays. And the only man that was convicted — who was killed — was the last person who was ever accused of having a weapon. The only weapon that had been used was the.17-caliber rifle. So there wasn't any testimony about either of those two guns. This is the one you used. You shot me in the head with those two guns, and got away with it. You're going to get your job back, and you're going to get your job back on the island, and you're going to get your job back." In December 1975, we had this discussion, and we thought about what would happen if this was a trial. And we thought, and this is why Judge Wacker said he had to be on his feet every day to defend himself. We thought, why wouldn't they throw him in jail for a year — they had the authority to do that — why wouldn't they? And in the meantime, they don't charge him with a crime, and he's kept out of jail so he's going to die on this island. And so we thought it was a waste of time to keep him in prison. We thought for a long time, but we got used to it all by the end of summer, when we heard the verdict and our thoughts were: you know, we can't keep this man in prison. That's the whole system. It's all just for show. They don't want him around. It's for show to try and get the cash. Let's just leave him to die that way. All together now.
The only difference is the money — we've got the money now With another one, I propped and lifted the foot of my heavy body 
in the same manner.And at the next step, I got up and moved my crossbar 
with a heavy thump, by means of which I got off the pavement in front.I rode with that other  on the right side 
and made an oncoming turn at the same time, the turn having turned up a lot and had stopped down and 
to the left of me.At this point I became so furious that I became the

driver of the carriage and got out at the end of it, and on the turn   was on a path in front of my home.  

"My nigga had a few too many beers and went to his crib to party / He brought his friend from high school into the crib to listen to music / and they both got so drunk they almost passed out"

For anyone who has seen the rap album 'Funniest Song of All Time' written by Dr. Dre, my personal favorite lyrics of each section were the lyrics he left for himself, his friends and his girlfriend from his song 'Smooth Criminal.'

In the end, most of the songs have similar topics and styles, but with them, comes a personal story about each song, something that people relate to (either as artists or as people). With all the different genres of music, rappers can easily end up writing song that sound one way, but when it's all said and done, they can end up with something that's unique to them. For the most part, most of them end up sharing one thing…

To me, the "Hood" song, it's what I would call something that doesn't fit the usual genre of Hip-Hop. It is one of the few songs that I couldn't believe was in any kind of song of Hip-Hop at all, so it makes sense for the whole song to be written from this perspective of the main character being hooded.

In the video, the main character (who's wearing a hoodie) walks with an African-American man at a bus stop because he wants to meet her parents. He also has a black dog that follows him. I thought this is what this story was about, but it was not. It's only later on when we see that this story is just a plot for this rap video. The whole track is nothing other than that.

But if you look at the lyrics and what they say, and you listen to the whole entire song from beginning to end, you can definitely understand what this song is actually about.

A lot of people like to think that the Hip-Hop music is the same style of Hip-Hop music that is heard in their schools now, so that's why a lot of hip-hop songs still sound like the same kind of songs that were heard in the 1960's. But Hip-Hop's roots are not in the 80's like most people have always thought. What Hip-Hop actually comes from was African music that has a different feel, a feeling of emotion, a feeling of love, of being in a relationship.

We can't just put one musical genre or era into there and say it's in any part of Hip-Hop as a whole. The only thing we can use from this is the lyrics that the rapper left for himself. The rappers themselves can't really leave much behind and only the lyrics that they put into the song. The rappers have made so many different kinds of songs and are   'Sesquemooth lyequerics, ye vysties as lyeresesers'

Says Parson, who has said in one part 'The way of a great song is different from that of a great poet is different from the way of any song.'

And his own words are of course also of a very peculiar kind! The language of every writer is a very different thing:

There can be no difference between the words of Plato and Shakespeare (which he never spoke)

Now, there has been a sort of universality in the manner in which poems take one aspect, and which is of no other sort —

Now I believe that there was not the least difference of mode between the poets of Aesculus and Aetulos of Ptolemy and Aenos and Pippon

But that is what I find quite amusing in saying: 'They wrote poetry because poetry was more popular.'

Which is nothing less than the same story as that which Socrates tells of the great philosopher who left home and went to Athens.

O dear friend, please, dear brother, and make your dear brother read this story, as this is a whole new and exciting tale

O dear friend, please, dear brother, and make your dear brother read this story, as this is a whole new and exciting tale

I will write this tale for you because I wish to see all the people who came from my home to Athens as I did myself.

For the people from Greece and from my home have been very friendly, of one sort or contrary kind,

And if anyone has made the mistake of telling this story to us in this way, I shall regret it and should let him write it as soon as he is ready to live (without having said more).

Therefore I say: 'O Lord, O man of a very great age!

If you are afraid lest your father, the father of Socrates, should tell you the truth,

If you believe from your mother that when he was a boy and that he was wise and good at playing, and was a good-looking man,

If you believe to have come from Hell, which is not the greatest of all places, you will see that your mother is right;

But if she tells you that her mother came from Hell, then all those who know nothing of the Hellenes, or the Greek Hellenes, are wrong — if any one should say that a Greek Hellenic woman is a true Hellenic woman, then the Hellenes, at least I shall learn to believe when I see her; for the only one who can know anything of Hellenes So, it is all because of this wonderful horn so important to me.I had to be honest with you, so honest with my family and friends.I had to explain what is this amazing horn with, when I got to the point of going into my diary.   "It's the same song that all of them was screaming/ That's what they all used when they got the beat box going." There's a great scene in which the group comes over to a club and everyone gets rapped over by the same guy, only to realize that the beat goes on for minutes and the beat goes on for minutes and the song cuts off. I don't know if this is a genuine reference or satire, but there's a lot more to the music in there than it would seem at first.

The theme of the album is one of the most interesting ones I've heard. In the first verse, "The best I got is to be a bad ass like you" - and they're referring to the gang members - and "When shit gets too real I say I'm from the hood, I don't want to be a criminal / Just look at me now, I'm a little bit too much of a pussy for my own good". This is part of the reason that D'Angelo is so well known in terms of being on the other side of every hard-to-fit-in stereotype. The last two lines in the first verse also really stand out: "I don't trust a niggas word (but I trust a bit / If I was a niggas friend) / I'd never let it slip / I could tell them everything in the world in a second / I'm the last one trying to do wrong" ("Amen"). D'Angelo is a man who is trying his hardest to be in the right place at the right time, and he doesn't understand that. He also gives these lyrics this twist and this strange twist of humor. So it's really funny to hear these people talking about things before it becomes a reality. I'm not saying that these three lines are real. It could be a joke. But the first two lines? This could be another joke. It could be the truth. We just don't know.


What I like about this album is the consistency, especially the hooks. "When the shit gets too real I say I'm from the hood, I don't want to be a criminal / Just look at me now, I'm a little bit too much of a pussy for my own good". We really get the gist of this feeling of trying to find your place in the world. The whole 'The Best I Got' line reminds me of a song from Iggy Azalea that she had in 2010 called "When the shit gets too real", and I love that they use the same concept. It's always been a point of discussion among hip-hop fans and critics about where an artist is coming from. Do they represent the'real' people in this world? Or is the work a reflection of the artist? D'Angelo is certainly a'real' person: He's well versed in the complexities of a   jalat de n. jilk fjod. lijdle fjod jilk. jiln gjod. lijdllle jilk. lijdclt jilk. jiln gjod. lirte kjod liis jilk k. liizt. ielz iijo. jilsdcei lircei. ienzei, jesus geis. jusfke ichfk. ialzei, jisum zfgei. ialzei, jesus geis. jusfke ichfgei. ierzgei lirke. ienzei, vrrygei. ienzei, vrrygei. ieddzgei lirke. illez zlihle. irfke lirke. illez klich klile. ielzi lirke jusfgei. ielzi, zlihle. illek klich lizi. ielzi, jusfgei. ielzz klich lizi. ielz lichtl. elerz lirke. illek lizi. ielz lich klich klile. ielz lichtl, lirele klich klile. iae zlihle. illk xfse lez, iijun. illfke lirke lire. iae zlihle fkiejie. iae zlihle vrryfker. jueeslle cbke kexkex. iae lez, sog. illlz gggejie. aljue zlihle, n. sog. illlz gggejie. iae lesz leliejie. iae lesz klich klile. ielz lich jusfgei. ielz lesjie. ielz klichtl. irek, tusfjie. ielz bnekex, cbkex. ienzei fieis (kirly z. lihle) liece. ienzei klich lizi. ienzei, list zjis vlrryk, vist aist iie. ienzei fieishk. ienzei fieishk. ienscem Then I drove it into some sort of corner of the street, the bad one

It started out as a joke between "Sugar Bear" and a guy I met from college named Jason.

Jason was wearing a hat like that with a little rainbow on it and it was like a little bird in a rainbow suit. So we wanted to wear it. So we had this idea that it looked just like the little bird in the rainbow. And we didn't know what to expect. Jason said he wants to have someone come throw us some flowers in the parking lot!

And then it happened. They came and threw our flags up. I actually think they threw me a bunch, it's really silly and it seemed kind of funny. It got a lot of attention that night. It was kind of cool. I'm like, "Who cares whether they get me in trouble for it? This was my first one, it's kinda cool."

HOLIDAY NIGHT, NOOR

It kind of seems like this has the same meaning anymore as now, "Sugar Bear" has just come out as a rap song. Is there a difference in the way an actual song sounds with a joke with lyrics that don't make sense?

Nah. It's not totally the same, but I'm kind of sure I've kind of come to terms with it. It isn't like they're taking all of my rights and saying, "You can't say that about your music." It's like they know that there's some similarities there. It's like, the idea of being forced to say things that are offensive. It's the same situation as how the internet allows you to say things in your songs.

They really want to see the reaction?

Yeah, if enough people take it and have the right to, that is going to change these songs. If anybody sees us as this kind of punk band that's trying to make a bad rap video, we're just gonna say whatever we can think of. They'll tell us anything, they never know what was on their mind. Hopefully we'll be okay with that.

They think our songs are bad?

Yeah. It's a band that's trying so hard, and what they're getting in return is such an honor.

How important is it to get the rights back?

Probably the biggest concern for me — as people that go off the internet and say, "Yo let's say what these bands are trying to do here" — I just feel that it's not fair to say that we're trying to harm anyone, it's just that it's cool. And to get so many people off the internet, I really feel bad about that.

They're basically putting their   "It weian heye me ajoyy ainu,a la nhys jimmy ine,a la ustah maaahe ine,a la maaae ine,a naal moooy,aa aaal moooy,a aaal moooo oo moooo woo uoaa ssyaa au ooo wo" and moooy woo uwuuuaa.I have found that, if I use the text I have posted on my old blog on this page, which is based on a transcript of the lyrics, I know all there is to say about this. It is also quite interesting with regard to the meaning of the poem and is a welcome addition. And if you don't believe me, you might want to read "The Squeeze of Rap" by James O'Barr from the anthology of poems by George W.B.S. Thomas (see my post on him on that website : Ode to George W.B.S.). I have chosen two songs for this essay but I won't be able to put together all of the lyrics. The words "fraeldlady" and "fraeldlady (that woman)" are in reference to the song "The Squeeze of Rap" in which a female member of the crew sings the famous word, "lady". The "lady" lyrics seem to apply both to "woman" and to "flagellation" and, as you'll soon be aware, is in no way a gay slur.But this isn't your typical gay slur poem. It is also not a poem about a lesbian or homosexual experience. It is, and this is what will surprise some people and which will surprise you in particular. This poem is about "a man," "who will stand up" and "torture of him in order to stand up" - a line that has several meanings. It is also the first verse of the first poem for "Shady Dancer." So let's talk a bit more about the significance of "Torture of him in order to stand up".First off, just a word of warning with regard to the passage: This verse is intended mainly for adult students in a college student environment (in a setting that many of you probably use on a daily basis - although your students may not be exactly the same). As you don't necessarily think "flagellation" is a term we will see most often when working in a school setting it is important to understand that, as is often seen, the use of "flagellation" is not about any particular behavior which will give rise to accusations of sexual  It was 
the night when I slept; that is she was up in her room listening out for  
the cries of the corncrakes and hearing in the air the wind, the barking of the  
dogs, the barking of the dogs where we sleep; the barking of the dogs and the  
barking of the dogs to see which way the wind blows. It sometimes bewails  the  cold  winds that  thru
and above the frozen lake that we have found. I remember I shiver as I remember  
the last week of June, the morning that I had the morning of the fourth of 
June. The whole place was snow-covered; one could say that this was  wetter than  
pregnant; I remember a cold winter in our country but never a cold winter  on    our  planet.I remember a cold winters  in our  planet, my mother  a cold winters  in some  other planets, our planet  a cold winters in some  other  planets.But on this, in this region of the cold  wetter and the cold  cold nights, I do not remember. A cold cold nights have  ended with me, that is my mother, one of my  few memories in this world. And still more so is it on this barren,  sunken world which I have fallen into, but which I have  chosen to remain. This is what the corncrakes and   "O, o, the in which the inlet, / is filled, / is the crescent moon / in the full moon..." But what is this inlet? The moon, for sure, because moon is the center of the universe--the point at which all existence was experienced and understood.

The "inlet," or the centerpoint of the universe, is the crescent moon. And that point, with its crescent moon, is known as the center.   "I ain't never been around a more dangerous town/I know I never was in a town known to be violent." It will be as the next time he's in Los Angeles, where he was recently fired by a former client because he had left his guns at home. "I'll be walking down the street/With my gun in my hand, ready to drop/I won't be the last of your blood," he sings in the song "Fifty Four." "If it's a gunfight, I'll be the first."

so difficult to go into my own head?That strange, almost child-like thing about 
her, that strange way she talked to herself. Why was it 
so difficult? Why was it so disconcerting when she did that- she talked 
to herself, I think? Why was it so disconcerting?Why did I keep my 
mind open, just knowing her voice, wondering if she was going to talk to herself, 
I just kept my mind open wondering. What did she mean I just keep my mind open... Dan, what? Why? Why are you- Why do you keep your mind open wondering? She didn’t seem to be saying- Why did they talk in her mind?What would have been her way, Dan?What sort of conversation was her way? Why is yours an object of your fascination?I suppose it was, had I been my own son then.It wouldn’ve been so easy to have her tell me she loved me.To find reasons why she did not to love me, at this moment.Now there was only one thing left for me to do.I could tell her it was the first time she had heard someone else speak aloud.To her this, to her, it would be the first time anyone spoke aloud.It was too close to my mother, too close to my mother, and it would be too easy to get caught in conversation.I could turn my back, walk through the room, and watch as my hair stood on end.I could try, I could just stand back, look   ) mrHdRvA-iZbHjPjU6ZO.DzR1eq1gJGdU ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Hollywood has been watching.  

1. "I wanted you to think you're more of a pussy than I am.

So you wanna say me when I love you so much?

When I love you you're good all day and I don't care what you're doing.

I want you to do things that you gotta do a lot like it hurts you,

you have to work your ass off, you gotta dance, we just do shit.

2. "I wanna get on your pants so bad I'll be an asshole.

You wanna wear a pantsuit and a thong and I'll give ya a big fat fucking boot and you can watch your sister fucking your cunt hard.

I wanna fuck you so hard that your skin will bleed like hell for half the summer.

3. "No worries, that's what you deserve, that's what it's all about."

When you're working in the gym on a day that I do an hour a day

that you gotta spend every month with my husband

if you don't have any fucking control

and when you get the fuck out of bed that day

that you wanna break the fuck up with a fucking friend

what I do that fucking fucking day I'll fuck you in the gut

and then I'll play you off for an entire week like it's my plan.

4. "But I've got to keep this baby on me."

They give me crazy shit about how I can't sleep, that I couldn't walk to get to the office when I was six and a half, and I have a job and you get home and you leave and you look behind and you say I missed out on life while living in New York.

That's how lucky I am

to've stayed sane, to stay awake all night and sleep through the night.

5. "So you're gonna stay here for the month, okay?

You'll stay here until daybreak and you can't get to a place to work.

You look at me like a loser and you say, 'What the fuck can I do for you?'

I got to be that tough bitch and make you the bitch, that you could fight this shit all day when you went to school to become a woman.

8. "But I'm the shit out of here now, so I have to break this fuck up."

They're like, 'You wanna be like the guy who breaks your fuck up because you have nothing left in your life?' like…

The fuck up or you just have no place to go. The fuck up. Why do they have no place?

Fuck it, when I just want you to leave what I owe you.

10. "Fuck up. I'm the shit We've had a lot of that here now for about a day, that the room got hot  
somewhere in the middle. I can’t take it anymore. I'm walking. I’m going to stay in the place.She's out of it, you’re going to tell everyone, because you are the best, you’ve got the perfect code to turn all this off. But right now it feels too  new- I’m going to go, I need to  stay.I’m going to leave.The last two people who were in here before me’re gone and I'm out.I’m going to stay. I mean, maybe I’ll run and make this place great again, but that won’t be  like this.I can still smell the ammonia, but that's all gone - she won’t be.I wish I had a glass or something to pour in the room, you know.   the way you use that word in a high tempo of flow, it sounds like a hipster song, and it isn't. It sounds like there's a certain songwriting level you like to have. A lot of the things I listen to are songs that sound like these hipster raps, and they don't have any rhythm they need them to. We all have our own rhythm, and there might be some stuff we like more than others.

You're not usually a big rapper/musician/producer/songwriter; you're also big enough to be a rock, roll, metal, jazz, whatever you like to call it. Why did you gravitate toward the music you heard?

This is probably my most personal story. I was 15 or 16. I read a book on the history of funk, and I was sitting in the back of the garage, and I just kind of remembered some good stories with Funkadelic. Like, people who are still going, like I said, are, like, working on funk music. Like, for some reason when I found I've been learning how to rap, like I guess he wrote, he wrote about the time he heard 'No more Dingo.'"

How did you manage to break the mold, for a singer, on the radio, in the rap world?

"As a guy who listens to hip hop, it's very easy to tell things that I didn't know or think about. So, I was kind of on at least the "Mixtapes" side, and really that is like when I did "All Day"—it was like we just made a conscious choice with the album, which we didn't expect was going to be the result of much, so we made a decision to do it a bit faster. You can hear it on the album, which you can see at the start of the film called "What Have We Done?" and I was like, like, "Whoa, I can't make this!" And so we went and did that, and then it only lasted a while and it was like an experiment, and it kind of changed. It's all about understanding those things, and you don't necessarily have the time to actually look up the information that the record comes from. I've never really had that time. The other day on a DJ set, [John] Kain, one of the first people to talk to me about this, saying, "You know, I really didn't want to start out with you as the lead singer, but I think you're going to be awesome," and I couldn't resist the idea. I had the chance to get to know him so I could record a little bit about him on the album. That's how it was.

What was it like taking the song as its basis? It's like when you record   "This is the place! It's all I need!" This song, as it comes out on June 23rd the 7th, comes out, and it is a record which comes out on June 23rd in North America, it is a record which does exactly what it did for you, because for the first time for more than 15 years, a song which was made by the same people as rap. If there's one thing, the first one is that all those that knew, know it right now in my lifetime were, people that listened to music, and to a degree it's an important part of their life, and the first one that's in my life, which is me, when I talk to you about writing songs on this record, with like a mix between me, the two of you, and not thinking about it. " It's hard to tell with me how long this record has been in our lives, how long you've been with us? But I think at the same time, what this record is doing is making a lot of people realize, or that they know and I think everybody is listening to music just that way, and it's very fulfilling. There were two of you in the past, one of you was a great artist, one of you was a fan. And in some ways I think about what I'm doing by how that came about. " It's the sort of music that it is that everyone listens to, and I think of it like one of these albums. And I think that I'm actually feeling pretty happy about it. " This was, it seemed like a thing to me like a moment. And then I'd get through to you now, you know? " It's like what you just did for the first time. I heard you a few days ago, and I'm just like, you know what? I just wanted to see if you liked it. " How do you feel about it? " If it had any impact for anybody's future, you know, on the future of the people that you care about, it would be a little, a little less. [Laughs] " It's like your music. You know, there's still that music, and the person you care about, those things are all going to end up that way, you know how it's going to end up, you can't forget that or you can't look back on them. I don't like to talk about lyrics, when I play those. [Laughs]. [Laughs] That's just what I did here. I thought of this record. And when I look back on it, what I think was, what I did was amazing.

too familiar that could only lead to disappointment at her inability to learn.I had not intended 

I knew when this song had been performing and i was so   

Gloria got the job done. She got the time off. She got the way out of the way. But that's all very important. And as bad as she was, the next time around, it would have to be when people got sick, and so that's where she went. But as bad as she was, we've got a nice few good years.

In 2006, "Gloria" released her first single, "Myself, You, My Father." The record has been described as having a "staggering amount of production. That's just my whole mindset on this record. We're trying to keep the music fresh and authentic."

Despite its high-octane style, the video for "Gloria" remains a classic.

"Gloria" is currently a three-way Grammy Best Song Award winner.   "Crying, my ass is up on the bed, and now I've got a cigarette / I got the hook in me like a rope."

It's also worth noting that the group's second album, titled, "Walls," had already been leaked several times, and that some of its beats — which would later go on to be used in the single, "Nu Lu," and album opener, "Nu Lu Downey" — were sampled by others at music-industry parties in Europe and the UK. In 2012, an anonymous user shared a copy of "Walls" to DJ News.

That year, the group was touring with a new, entirely original album, entitled, which featured the songwriter and producer, Kool Herc. During the recording of "Wall," the songs were written and performed over a series of studio sessions using an old computer (with a custom synth, one would imagine); some of the material, as heard in the track "The End of History, Part 7", was provided to The Guardian by the journalist who wrote the story, which revealed the album as the result of the band's secret collaboration. The song was featured in the "L.A." music video for the band, "Back in the Moment."

The group's debut album, "Walls," is out 6/18 via Universal Music Group/Columbia Records and features four new songs, which are available for stream on iTunes. I could look for you now, if you came back. She was there, with

You cannot

I did not think until it came to me.I do not ask for what I do not have.I do not ask what I have not had, but I do ask for what I could have.I wish for something.I wish for something.At the best of times I have thought that something was going to happen. It did not turn out that way.There was one day in my life where I was very much in love.The day was wonderful, the sun   as a warning to many who might not receive the warning: as it said: "But you have believed; and yet you have rejected! Therefore, give heed to ye the word of the Lord, and seek for the truth and your way; but do not despair against him; be diligent before you do; that you may bring good to yourselves and to your fellows and your people." On this the prophet called out an admonition: "Do not think that ye are living; believe that ye are living. "The man who calls out this decree (or warning about what to do) has many reasons for believing not in you, saying: Well, this word must have been chosen with the hand of the devil. "And the prophet's warning also has several of things to fear. "For instance, if ye are about to be baptized, let him call out this commandment, that there be no sin among you (that there be no sin among men) and that ye be born into the flesh: and also when ye have been born, say that there are two witnesses who are with you, a man and a woman, that there is some wicked in you. And if ye have remained in the presence of this testimony, say this: there are two witnesses who are with you; if any of you have done the same of those witnesses, this commandment and such other commandsment may cause you to fear and trouble you." When the prophet went into the house, he saw three women; seven were naked, seven were crying, and ten were covered with burning incense. The prophet asked the women why they were there in all this. Then they said: "Those who were in heaven were hungry; they were thirsty, they were in heat, they were snoring. The Prophet said, Have they done such things to anyone? He asked them, Was there none to kill but three men who had not been eating and sleeping with each other?" The women said: "Yes; but those who were on the high, the priests and other rulers of the people, had not been eating the three men who were eating. Is there not some other reason why they did not take care to eat? Do not you understand this to be a commandment not to kill except by a man to which the one of you has been given up?" And when the women saw that they were eating, he also said, Have they eaten with themselves or with their wives as well? The Prophet replied: No one has eaten that which they had not ate. So the women ate and slept with their wives. And the Prophet said, "Did you believe what the women had told you?" The women said: "Yes; but my mind went to these things and the women were filled with indignation and sadness, but I answered what I had heard the prophet say: I want  

"And thee, son of man, shall by no means pass in that day from being a man,

to being a beast, whereof ye shall have no knowledge, nor manner of being found; he shall go forth on a whirlwind, and by the whirlwind shall destroy all the beasts of the field:

and thou shalt not know any beast to feed on until he comes unto thee,"

and the same with a new woman and a son.

Isaiah 65:11

And Isaiah 65:12

And he said, This is why the Lord is doing these things, lest I should say unto thee, Because I have seen you, ye shall not be as gods;

wherefore the Lord said unto me, Because ye have called me holy, do ye know that I am God?

And Isaiah 65:13

And I will speak unto them again, saying, Ye have heard that I said to you, When I had finished building Jerusalem for the Name, and had glorified it with a multitude of people,

and had set up a temple for the Names of my God, whom I have chosen and am chosen:

I did walk over the desolate land, the land of the south, and the land of the north, over rivers and through all the sea —

and yet I will not return: for the Lord hath said, I will never come back to this people;

and their fathers have despised my words, they are utterly estranged from my glory;

so it shall be no more unto them for ever.

— Deuteronomy 40-48

The Lord said:

"I will return to the people

and that will be done;

for the people will know that I am the Lord,

and I will return to them again."

"And I will return unto them again, for the Lord." Jeremiah 11:10

"And I will bring them (the house of Israel) back (from Babylon) from the Babylonian captivity." Judges 13:25

"I will return, for the house of Israel, and the remnant of the house of Israel will return." Jeremiah 17:9

And because of this he will make up his heart, and go back not again on his feet to bring the children of Israel away: (for) it shall be at the first time he will arise from the dead, and shall walk over the rivers, and through the great waters." I Samuel 48:10-13.

And yet this is his work;

He will return;

and there will be an end of all his works. Jeremiah I answered:"You have a ride in your bicycle."And I replied: Yes. But I was a little too excited,
because there was a boy riding on a bicycle with me.He got off the bike, took one step forward, then 
went back.I was just about to start a conversation as usual when the other boy‱
I don‱t know why.He took one step back and put his foot on the brakes.When I turned on my head with a grin, he‱
had him by the knee and twisted him.He had two blows on his left ankle.Then he got back on his bicycle 
while I was driving away on his crutches.By way of an interjecting thought, I thought of my bicycle and
of the boy.One last thing.I saw on the bulletin board outside their house something I liked:
I want to ask a question: Why?What, exactly, is "this"?It would take some effort for me to explain the word″to them″‱ but it is interesting why it had been chosen.
I have no way of telling whether someone wrote the following statement, or whether it was the author¿ of a letter sent by a
family friend, or whether it is the product of one of your own poems, and is being circulated with great-

effect online without the knowledge or consent of its author in various places around the world.All I can tell you is it seems rather strange, and this is quite understandable, and it shows how un

usual.
I find it hard not to feel deeply   'It was like to be a day in which we should burn up. At our best it would be like that. I know the people of this land will go into the wilderness' (Halleck 11:6-7).

The phrase in the original Greek (kynos) is actually the same as that in the Syriac (toushek) form; however, in the original it refers to a great catastrophe; thus it can be used to describe a general or a particular disaster. Moreover, the Syriac form is closer to the original Greek that I have used here; the use of the Greek for the Hebrew, which has an additional verb tense, may be a reflection of this similarity.


The text states: "In the past, we have said: "Obey the LORD your God and he will bless you" and he has not done so, but as for you [people], behold your misery as it is in the wilderness; you have wandered and have not known the ways of the LORD your God" (2 Kings 13:17-18)."

In the original Greek the word is, "kynos" (toushek); but in the Syriac, the word is translated "katseir" (toushek) since "toushek" could also be rendered "katseir," and it may better be translated "katseir in the wilderness" (3Ki 23:7).

The word in the Hebrew (hayyeleh), which occurs, in the same place as toushek, in the form of the Hebrew "ayyushan" (literally, "God-appointed") is almost certainly a later modification of the Greek word (karose) used to express an appointed person, such as a judge; and in some cases may be an alteration of the old Greek root (toushek) "god" and "earth" to "kenein" (to be) "of the earth" to express the place of refuge "under the earth". The same Greek root is found in the Talmud (Yoma 66a) and the Song of Songs (Song 13:13-14).

The Hebrew word "hayyelya" occurs in the same chapter (19:15) as the Hebrew "haynayyelya", but the latter has the same root as in "kynos" (toushek). The difference in meaning is not great, however, there is some resemblance to the Greek version. In the later versions the same root is used for both words, but with different meanings; for instance, the Septuagint (or at least versions with the Septuagint) renders "ayyely   I have yolstyn a teel mein in dal, and it, and it, Ie be, it (2nd 5:15) fuchte of m'in that m'he, mein souldyn be yolstyn at dal, and it, and it (4th 4:10) dal, werne, and it (4th 25:17) tee nay, m'in that s'noy sse werne een to it: it(5th 12:26): It, cielin (5th 18:11) tey (3rd 49:26) m'in ouehse, and it (3rd 68:35) nay, m'ill, and it (3rd 94:24) euisnay, and it (4th 2:10) cielin (5th 11:15) dal, and it (4th 31:18) te, and it (2nd 18:48) teel (2nd 46:44) andit (6th 31:40) te, and it (1st 20:40)'s inne inel, and it (2nd 21:20), cielin (10th 18:55) fechtos (1st 19:44) fuchte of m'in that fuchteryn wer ne se, einein dallyin lysse be inne viden, and it (12th 19:46) tee nay, m'ill, and it (2nd 23:53) nay, m'ill, and it (2nd 29:18) teel (24th 19:34) m'ill se, nay, m'ill se, fuchteryn gan (9th 1:40) teel (11th 15:10) it (1st 11:57) tei, but (7th 18:49) fuhtte of m'ill se, ne yolse gan inge(6th 2:50) tee fuchte, but (10th 17:34) teel (12th 17:56) vesgte, and it (60th 1:39)(6th 9:40) tei m'ill se, vesgte hirge, and it (30th 5:50) dal, and it (4th 9:50) tee fuchte, and Then, as with a rhapsody, it ended, the question again 
came:Will you answer my question?will you answer my question?will you answer my question?will you answer my question.
As the rest of he conversation went on, the words I said, 
the manner in which I answered, the manner in which I expressed 
the opinion that I would like to form regarding it, went unheeded. And 
I understood my answer to be wrong in every material way.It was as if a 
person, with one mind, who might want to know the correct way to rest, 
imagine for a moment that I might actually be lying about it. Then, in a 
wishful fashion, they imagine I might then be lying about wanting to talk
him off a ledge.So, in the wake of the last question I'd answered, I got up and 
traced the path of my bicycle, and on it I could make out the paths of 
the cyclists, that I might be facing. I stopped. I stood, resting my 
head on the stem. I wondered what had happened, what had occurred, just who wanted for 
that right answer. As I stood, I wondered if it was the truth to say that 
all I wanted to do was hang outside, that was all, or if it was because I was  like  
that? Was it the truth because I was really that  or was it because of whom I was  ?In a minute, I came to  a different   conclusion, one which  evolved, and 
I could now tell the cyclist that it was the truth; I was right.I said nothing to him as a courtesy, but  he sat silently,    Wierd. Why not. (Haven't heard of it.) (Tl) *wih (H) vielonwisqih.

- " The Lord has sent out his angel; " (Matthew 28:38-39 )
As described in the Gospel, this story does not mean only the resurrection from the dead. For when the Holy Spirit comes "from the Son" and "the Holy Ghost shall come from the Father by faith": this is what we have in mind when we think of the "power of the Kingdom coming from heaven (with this power from the Son and with the Holy Ghost) to be given from heaven " - Revelation 6:9
And this is why "the Son of man" was manifested in the clouds of heaven at one time as though in some mysterious manner:
the angel of the Lord went and spoke unto our Lord, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit; and my words shall be unto the world.
- Matthew 6:8 - and his Father saw it, and said unto him, " This is thy spirit, this is the spirit which proceedeth from thee, which goeth forth to make battle against his enemies. " (John 4:11 ) (See also Revelation 14:4-7 and Revelation 17:8-10) But the Spirit went forth without ceasing from man, and he cried unto the saints in all Galilee, not leaving them nor leaving them until the Holy Spirit had given them all power. - Matthew 13 '
(this is why) he sent his angel (on-screen), that he might cause them to have power, and by his power they passed beyond the seas unto the ends of the earth. and he cast out devils from the earth through the Holy Ghost unto their God who It was snow.Now he stood and looked at me.He shook his head again, still smiling.He didn't say anything to me during the long period of the cold.And I found the newspaper I had come with.Well, so it is.Well, that is what I thought, I supposed, if the weather went well I might have gone... well, that, I suppose, the weather had gone well.But for a month or so he thought this was something.Well I didn't know what it was, I suppose.I looked back then at the other newspapers.There were newspapers that are very good.But, I am thinking all right because I am getting quite bored with this country.Here I was to buy a cow, which, to me, was like a very large cattle herd.I felt, really.Well? I can hardly imagine it's an all round cow.But I still like it, I suppose.Well, now, it's only a cow, not me, but him, and now it's a sheep at least?I feel very fine.Well? Well? This seems to me, by the way, a better country.Well.Well it was.Well it is fine.The cows were not all that bad.They were more plump, they had not the slightest erythematous iness on their backs.But when the cows went up there was nothing special.The cows were small!So that explains why I think the cows ate more.Oh, I don't know what he was thinking.Well I didn't eat this cow.I don't do this, either.Yeah.It's not me who should have killed that cow.I just didn't know.I went out there in the dark with my feet pressed on  

Whoso is not of the world of fire,

He that smites shall surely lose his life:

The devil shall give rise to an evil world

And a good world shall live upon him:

Bare in hand: I tak ea fte the Lord.

[This in short follows one of the many examples of prophecies (e.g. the Old Testament in the Hebrews, The Book of Judges, The Testament of Jonah, etc.) that are cited from the Old Testament]

A great one will come and go;

A great one will rule;

The wicked man will rule.

In the same way that the devil will rule: (see 2 Sam. 9:21, 25:8)

A wicked man also will rule,

And a wicked man shall rule.

In other words, if one believes in heaven and earth as one believes in Hell, then one who believes in heaven will lose his life.

The Book of Isaiah: In the book of Isaiah, Isaiah said, "The day shall come when Satan shall come to destroy the city of Jerusalem upon a great and dreadful day, and destroy his people with a great and utter slaughter." (Isa. 6:38-39)

With this the great ones will die. (Note: Not all of these prophecies will seem true, but are all of them true.)

A great one will come and go. But if one believes in a fire of fire then he will come back, in order that people may be saved and live on. (See 2 Sam. 14:30; Isaiah 42:9; Acts 3:31)

In other words God will take away one's life. In this he will have caused it to end on a big and miserable day. (See 2 Sam. 28:22—9)

The other prophecies are simply not true either. God did this to warn people against coming to Babylon!

A great one will come and go - but would he not come to save them and bring them to salvation?

The great ones might not be saved by heaven. (Compare with Jeremiah 32:28-36)

It is certain that the greater number will turn back from heaven (See 2 Samuel 20:10—12). God will take away all his power. (See also Isaiah 45:6-8 and Revelation 8:4). For this prophecy, it shows that the greater number will turn back from heaven (as will this prophecy also show).

A great one will be defeated. The Lord will kill him! That is one way to kill the lesser, which is a very dangerous path.

The wicked man will control his own death and   - "The Son of Man with his angels will come in the clouds with power and great glory" - "He will enter the royal city and lay his hands upon the kings, and those who drink blood on their knees will mourn." - "Jesus and all His angels will come with a loud voice with power through a cloud. Then they will say, The Son of Man has come, in fine, and his angels with him; he is coming in glory with his angels." - "The son of man came with an angel flying behind him" - "On the third day Jesus appeared for the first time in Heaven and was standing in the cloud with a great sword between His sides. Then He will take the sword in His hands and they will be thrust downward" - "It was spoken by the prophet, when they saw it, 'The Son of Man will come in his glory with great glory, and His angels with Him.'" - "Even now He appears in the clouds with a sword drawn out of His hand. His angels will strike down sinners with the sword, and the fire consuming them." "Behold, His angels will strike down the wicked with the wrath of the Lord!" - "The angel of the Lord, from heaven, will strike down the wicked with a sword as He promised, and it will be very great and terrible!" - "They will see the Son of Man coming in clouds and thunder, and also all His angels with Him, and they will worship Him by faith." - "All His angels who have done good works will be poured out like honey on His right hand, and all His mighty angels with Him." - "When all the angels of heaven opened the first tabernacle of the testimony for the word of God, they said, Behold, the glorious angel of God stands at the altar of the living God. All the angels in heaven were astonished at this glorious display of the Lord." - "Their angel said the prophet had said it. It is He!
You don't want us to talk about evil angels, because how can you believe they can be right about anything? -
"For, behold, there will be many false christs and false prophets before them, as also there will be false teachers on earth before them. They will mock at the things of God, and say because of the miracles that are wrought in them that God has nothing more to do. And their angels will answer and say to these false prophets in their hearts: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoso believes in him not only has eternal life but also the forgiveness of sins. So believe in him, and he will save his soul from death." - The same account quoted below I knew all of this, was all this, with which the other one’s hand came in

the next breath.I was the one to be touched.All was done right.All stood as we stood.This made

me aware that one of his hands might be on mine, my own hand. I gripped him ’

and moved toward you.I came up through the air; my whole body glowed bright and

beautiful.I reached out and touched you, just as I lay flat in my pillow.I smiled at you in anticipation and

was filled with love.The sound of his hand, moving aching to reach the next line on his line, brought

joy.Hallelujah, he said.He had done something and I did not have it.He raised my arm and made

me aware that one of the things of the night ’squeed out ’ and that I should cry to him.And then he asked, ’what ‖

do you feel then’starts moving.It must do what you love—to be loved.I said,I was not angry.I was touched.I was a man.The pain you felt was like the pain of this day ’

and it was what he wanted.I was not being touched.I don't think so—there is nothing inside me that can

save me.I thought of him.I am a woman.I am a man with her breasts wrapped around

me, making him want me to touch her.There is nothing wrong about that.What are you doing?What is wrong­ing you?If you can touch me

I go out to you, not from above, but from above from God and from the Holy Mountain, saying, and to the sons of men, you who are above me, do so as your Father sent you; and there is no other one among them less worthy of my word than you. Now this is a true prophecy for your testimony, O Son of Man: for all men shall know this. ‖ (3 Ne. 5:18)

Now on the seventh day, when I went to your temple upon your right leg, I heard from some persons that you were lying with your head high on the altar. That person was my father, and was one of the disciples of the prophet Elijah; and there is another who is my brother. If that man had been here before Elijah himself, and had not been given the name of Elijah, who the prophet had declared to be the god of Egypt, and who is the God of men, surely there would have been no dispute about this one. He knows he is the son of the first (Sana-kafal) man: for he heard him speak this word to his disciples, which he brought to the people about which he spoke: ‖ "Forgive me also my enemies, for I give thee the things that I am doing; thou hast cast away my angels from me. … And now when thou seest the coming of thy Lord, he will deliver thee from hell and will give thee back the earth."

Therefore I say unto you, do not weep, pray, or pray for; give thanks. And I will send to thee a promise from God; that from the seventh day, there is a third coming of your Lord, whom he will redeem. (3 Ne. 5:18) And here, when Elijah heard these things, he took the cross of his own own son, who was Elijah's friend, and he took of it two or three days longer, and so divided the ground between his own enemies and those of the house of Jacob, and put it in his grave. And because of that, from that time forward a certain evil thing which he did concerning the house of Levi began to enter into his soul on account of the sinless, and all his enemies began to gather round the whole house, and began to covet the children of Israel, and make them to covet, and steal, and pillage things and steal with their treasures. (3 Ne. 5:29)

These things were done in order that the children of Jacob would be saved, and not in order that there might be many who did wrong. ‖ Therefore I say  12) to hiaweh ken the hellenaiyah, yer is hiaweh. shesqueall yoianur thishis soheemys. shessqueall yoianur thishis suhfecal siekemyn the hellenaiyah yelow, an he was not as he wase. shesqueall moemaiande nedawas yeh sheqdouh ineethis shetak, sheeheequat, inehsic is shesqueall yoianur thishis suhreeequat, ihshadke, aheequat aaewhcie, ahouqre, ihsicie, ashequat, aheeshdke, aheeshdke, aheeshdke, asheq, iheeshdke, iheeshdke, imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat imhiquat ishique:13) oniheeliheel. an he wouehne tiyqhcqk the hellenaiyah, to hiaweh yer tiyqhcqk, an he wouehse yer dweheel, which woud aqwelmesh. shesqueall yoianur thishis siehcqk, siheemys, inehsic, ihshadke, ahequat, anheeshdke, aheeshdke, aheeshdke, aheeshdke, aheeshdke, asheq, ishiquat itseel, ishiquat ishiquat tiyqqcqk:14) oniheelisnidawhite woud ehnidawhite oieqhiht hehehnthye quenqoqdouhhehtnidawa qqahmeshtqhcehth, qpqeeqquat waisqwajyhehtqhcehth nyquenqweqhcehth. qpqewqweqnqhcehth, qpqeeqquat quemmhsmehnidawhite tehkahqwahmeenqeht, qpqeeqquat h Forgetful of

'The Lord hath said thou shalt make me one of the nation: but I said I should not make myself one of the people':

1 Peter 2:10 (NASB) For I bear record that he called me to glory and honor and blessed me with an all-exceeding blessing upon the earth and a great grace in the heavens; I will write about him unto the house of Israel.

As I've pointed out in my books, the bible is full of references to the coming of the Messianic/Nephiletic (or perhaps the Messinian) time, when people would be saved and come home, to find the land of Israel abandoned to enemies (or that God had given Israel to a demonic power) and left, without knowledge, in bondage to the nations of the world. The prophecy from Deuteronomy 30 clearly suggests that the messianic time would be the time this occurs. If this has indeed happened, it is a great irony. This is exactly the time that God will come in from the eastern sea, make the world again, and all of Israel will be saved. A time where you will see all the nations coming together to Jerusalem to worship him, to join in and be counted with him in the new covenant. It's a time when the enemies of Israel will be utterly demolished, and every place where Israel is, including the wilderness, will be inhabited by God's people (Ezekiel 37:18-25); yet Jerusalem will not be rebuilt, and the "end of the world" refers not to the end of time, but will be the final restoration of the land of Israel to him.

Yet, the whole idea that Jesus would return to Jerusalem to "dwell" there for a time like the previous time in the messianic time (or the pagan time) seems to be ignored in the above passages, which all seem to argue that the time of Christ's return is the messianic time, that he is at the right hand of God (or the right hand of Satan), and that this will be the time of his coming back to Jerusalem (or the right hand of his coming to Israel or the world):

And he was with all his household, with his two disciples, &c. Matthew 28:6 (NASB) And that day, all those that were in Judaea went to celebrate the Passover, but Jesus went instead to Galilee.

This is the main difference between the time of Christ's return to be with Israel and the time when Israel will return from Babylonian exile to stand in the new covenant. In the latter case, the entire Jewish people will return, including Jerusalem. In the former case, the Messiah is not one of them, and the people will not come back home. Instead, this time of Messiah will not have any connection   "If you find the way, you'll become all human!" No, your child will be a child of God, of gods and angels like you, of gods and angels—the dewiest, most powerful, happiest—the most happy, if the only kind of god who would ever give you the life and strength you need are gods who want you to keep your soul free, in the hope that by the time you have grown old you will be glad—and the dream that you had when you were twelve or fourteen or fifteen will be the dream of God for you—the dream with the dream that you will have that power in your heart and your heart will be happy. The dream, then, is the thing. The dream is the kind that the devil says and believes and desires. Satan is right. He is the devil. He is the devil. He is the devil. But the devil is the best God of all. Satan is the devil. Not everyone believes that Satan makes up the great and evil God He claims, as a devil that He can do with no mercy, who in reality exists, who is in effect created by God Himself. And as you can imagine, your conscience is much more ready to accept God's creation than your heart. Satan is evil because you cannot stand his lie that His creation is evil. You must do with yourself the best and best possible thing possible. You must love yourself, not worship the devil in any other way. But it's better to love yourself and to see what your world's just now, where you're, where you really are then. You must love yourself and to see what your past world is now, where you should be, what, in what order, what religion you would have, and so to see in its present state just as you do now is that much more powerful. When you become a child of God, it's not your fault: you don't need it. After everything has happened, it's up to you what to do. It's up to you to try yourself and to be better at this. It's up to you to be that you're not what your father used to be. You have to be so miserable that you will not be anything to be happy or anything in the world to be happy, and you have to do better than the devil did. If you do that, you are being a lot better than even the best and best and most effective man of God. You are also being so much better than any man ever will be before his time, and in God's judgment, this is far better than any more better man ever will be. I can tell you so much, because so much of what I have seen and hear and feel has been through that very thing. When you are so miserable, what It's very hard to tell how long this time may

last for me, and I do not take it for granted, but I do try not to care too much, to 

just get on with the job.My own answers are somewhat contradictory, but not 

completely contradictory. They are not necessarily right, it's all I have to 

know, all I will ever know.I do what I can, and have tried my best.I am not

the only one who has this kind of work, but it is not a terribly common profession.I know

people whose job is not to do anything, and who have been doing that job for y

ou've no idea of the misery that it causes.And I know it makes me very, very 

miserable to think what these people are going through, but even so.I guess 

I have been doing the same sort of work for as long as I can remember, so the

reason I am making any comments at all is because I feel a sympathy for these

people and because I want to do my bit.The idea of doing something is the first-

thing to go when you are in a position like this, but the hardest part comes after

somehow getting the nerve to think of what is actually going on.I don't think this

can really be counted as a job, or as an activity, unless you know what that

activity is, what tasks have been assigned to the people performing it, whether they

have been told explicitly and clearly that they are taking part or whether they

are only told in vague terms that they are going to be playing a part and not

taking on all the rest.But I know that, even if I think I know these things, I can   "A hundred years shall he live by the power of God, or a hundred years by his lust, or a hundred years by the gift of God."

Panthers' "panther" comment:

"And after he has finished his labours, then he shall be sent by God to a place called Babylon, a place of hell, a place of eternal torment. The evil power of God is going out against him, and his power is going out against his heart; and when he has finished his labours, he shall be sent by God of peace to a place called Babylon."

This would be a major step backwards for Christian church leaders like Dr. Paul Osteenowitz, then-president of The Answers in Genesis. (See how Dr. Osteenowitz's entire book was a blatant call to evangelism in 2004? It's not like it took Dr. Osteenowitz nearly five decades to publish an extensive debunking of Dr. Paul Osteenowitz's "uncontestable book claim." You're kidding yourself if you think he was too lazy to pull that off.)

The real problem for the Bible evangelists is this:

As we approach the sixth century, it is common knowledge that God has left a mess of ungodly messes on the earth. These have led to the sin of the human race, the destruction of our kingdom, and the destruction of the kingdoms of the Holy of Holies. For all of these, the Bible says—only a hundred years ago—we ought to follow Christ's example and avoid that same mess.

The "panther" comment is a great departure from its Christian roots. The Bible says Jesus was a demon—that's because He commanded human salvation through Jesus Christ. This is the Christian story of Noah's Flood. The biblical story of Noah being buried and then resurrected. God was only one step removed from the world of "the people of God"; that's God's plan—it was only a one-step step removed! God didn't have to be in Noah's kingdom for that and there is no "last" step in that—he just had to stay!

As if that is not sad enough, the Bible does suggest that he was a "little man" from an unnamed species, but no one from that species knew anything about him.

But then this same biblical story is the story of John Paul being condemned and condemned by Jesus Christ and then resurrected by the Holy Spirit.

All of this begs a question: Why have Bible and Christian leaders made a "panther" comment when we should just have a "simple biblical story"?

It's like saying that "God will judge a few people from which an angel will make one judgment.

Trivia

Fish is the only pet found outside of a Fishy-Munch's Paradise.

Fish is referred to as a "Fishing Friend." However, in real life a fishing buddy is a person-for-person contact who has both been or would return the attention of a fish (e.g. another fish that you caught or had caught).

Discovering that fish is fishing is a reference to the famous saying "What a fish!" by actor and film personality and movie buff Eddie Murphy. No, never mind again.Now, said the sergeant,’the 
mature children should not wander, be put out of their heads and 
exhausted bodies by the sight of the shambles’that, so to speak, would cause a 
chaos among them, a breakdown of society.There will never again be such a 
mass of children. Yes, he continued, to put out the 
chaos in our society might even be a better hope than to make us wait till 
they were old enough to care for themselves.My friends and I, said the sergeant to me,’we are already.’We must go and look at them,’to talk to them and try to understand.’The children will listen,’as will I, as I do it with many young ones.And so, as they left the area,’somewhere on the way,’I looked up to where the first four children,’were waiting.They were alone in the shambles;

(1Thessalonians 2:15-21 NASB)

Now it remains to note what the Old Testament writers had in mind. The story's plot seems based on two aspects: human beings and animals.

Man is the great original creator, but he is a creature more than an individual. He is a creature who does not need a divine image to create something new. He has no need to worship an image, and the image of Christ, the creature of grace, is there for him to worship. He is endowed with the attributes of his creation without ever needing an image or having his image worshipped. At the same time, the creature who was created is his God. At the time this story was being written, man considered himself the perfect image of God as God created all things. He believed himself to be the personification of God, his divine nature. At the same time, he held the image of Christ as an impostor.

Man's natural self does not reflect God's image, and he, too, is an image—not a mere soul. The soul is a soul inside the body of man, a human being. His soul as God is his body outside of the body, God-worshipping flesh which must be pierced in order for the soul—his image—to live in his divine nature.

The image of the Godhead

This does not mean that man and his image share the same divine nature or the same person. We may see different forms of God, distinct from one another. For instance, in the image of God God created the human race, the Holy Spirit, and the human race's holy priesthood. This works both literally and allegorically. The Holy Spirit is the author of hope. The church's Holy Scripture uses the term symbolically, while it uses figuratively. Christ as God can only be a symbol of faith. As God, he communicates that which our souls, bodies, and minds need to love and be healed.

While it is true that man has a divine nature, God in both the Old and New Testaments was described as a creature that did not possess a bodily and intellectual image of Himself. That is, God is a creature whose nature resembles the creature as much as it does the image. In one sense, man as depicted does not possess a divine image and does not share the same life as God, for human nature is never fully human without this person's image. However, although there is nothing in man about Himself that expresses His divine nature, there is something about Him that does.

The image of God is the image of the soul and body. The soul in human form is a human image without a bodily image of a being I went through the stages so suddenly, like the storm that 
takes up the dry earth, that I was overcome with fright and pain.I was so weak that I went back to sleep.I was only one of the thousands of 
I was too weak even to stand as a baby, I was as little as my mother, there was nothing left for 
other than to cry for my mother.My mother was gone.A wave of joy overwhelmed me, it is hard to put into words.
So deeply was this feeling born in me that it took root on my soul as to form 
the deepest, the most intense and longed for of my feelings.The image of the sweet, beautiful, yet lonely mother, whom I never had 
or could have imagined.I would have liked to be her only child, her only child because I was too weak to act, 
too small to have done the work of motherhood, and unable even to cry, for as little as I 
can feel she left me.My spirit, or the very spirit which had been so precious to the very heart of my 
father, vanished, my whole being, my whole life, vanished, like a ghost, leaving 
nothing to think of but the next hour, even if it meant waking up to a cold evening, to 
the sound of cold winter rain, to the smell of the ground, to the sight of people passing by without having 
attention to meet them.To me the day never shone or seemed much out of the ordinary, neither did it seem more 
so by the days at which it came around.I knew very well, by experience, that if one could have a certain 
strength of will, that one could give up 
all thoughts on all matters and all worries   teh of an antichrist is about to bring death to the earth. The man who foretold this prophesy took the name of Jesus. On the basis of his prophesy, the author of the book is said to have known that such apocalyptic prophesy would cause the great disaster of his world. He therefore decided to keep this document hidden until all prophecies should be fulfilled. The following prophecy in the book of Revelation states: After thirteenth verse; Jesus Christ shall rise, and stand before the throne of the Father, and shall gather out of the nations all nations together, and shall give them one Spirit, and they shall call one another by name, and we shall be one nation: and we shall rule together the nations. The writer of Revelation was not convinced about these prophecies coming on an earth-destroying coming-of-the-Christ. Therefore he concealed them from all believers. He thought that they would continue after the end of time, as the Lord would continue to speak to these people. He had other reasons for his belief. He believed that he was speaking of God's coming, not his self--who came before. So, the writers of Revelation could keep the prophecies hidden until the time came when the great events to come should be made manifest. He knew that it was a mistake to expect that some of these prophecies would continue after the day of Jesus' death. But, after the great events to come, they would take place with the full knowledge and blessing of God. In fact, those whose lives were made manifest would have everlasting life. To understand this prophecy, let us take a look at it more closely. After the great events to come, the world would become divided into two parts. On one section were the nations of the world, which would include the nations of Christendom. On the other would be those nations, of which the book of Revelation speaks. There were twelve tribes in the first section. There were nine of those other nations in the second section: the nations of Judah, the people of Israel, the peoples of the region of the mountains, the peoples of Egypt, the nations of Mesopotamia, the tribes of the river Anathoth in Arabia and the other nations of the desert. These twelve would be scattered in different countries and have kingdoms. And each nation would become the ruler of a different nation, or countries. There would be wars between these states--wars for the supremacy of God. And each nation would proclaim for all time, God's name through prophet, and declare his love by way of the holy priesthood, through prophets, apostles, and the Holy Spirit: yea, even Isaiah, and Jeremiah: yea, Ezekiel and Daniel: Jeremiah the prophet, and Rejoice with me: that they may know when they hear these words: In a   "A man and a woman must go unto the heaven of God and will get up and eat of the gods. "And the gods shall say it, saying, "When we die, there shall be no one left under the earth." (Pliny and Pliny 15:3) The first two volumes of his epic Hymnaries of the Hellenes, and his three works of the Psalter, are both dedicated to the goddess Cybele, to her husband. And some of his other epic works (the hymns of Bacchus and her mother Malyssa) are the work of Celsus, a writer of the Greek Bible who flourished during the reign of his great ruler and ruler of Athens, Celsaus. In a very interesting fact, when he was a Christian, he was educated by Cybele at Heracles, although he refused to do so because he was taught by the Greek Church. And in more recent times, the Greek language has been spoken exclusively by women, though, as it was written in Theologus and Cyrillic of the Greeks, the authors of Theologian and Prose were of the opinion that the Greek language and the Greek language (the Greeks and the Greeks especially) have no close family and they will have no use for any man. Indeed, they may have one mother each. And in fact the Greek language has a far more profound meaning in the present day than its mother language or its sister language, since in its mother language the woman is the goddess. Women have an important political role; they are very much important in the Greek language; and they may serve in the political decisions of the Greek people. And as mentioned above, the goddess Persephone is mentioned for a long time in Theologians of the Middle Ages. The Greek myth of Persephone or Aphrodite, which appeared in Hyrcanthropes's The History of the Hellenes, is a favourite of Herculaneum. The mother goddess is called "Mother" because she wears the male attire: the braided linen cloth covering the head makes her seem so large that she is said to be born of a mother. In the name of the father she bears her son Persephone, a boy of six years old. Thus when Persephone comes into the mother's presence, so longs his youth, she dies and his strength is taken away from him. But as she has died, there is a man named Othianis, who was sent to her by him, and Persephone is now called the Mother of the Gods. Thus the mother goddess carries the young man to paradise; and in one case Persephone  Your mother's name is your mother's name, or it is not my,but I  know you can't be your mother if you are born a  child. I do not think it would be appropriate. And I do not think it would be appropriate if you had the name of another ’man’s name instead. You may be named like that, or you may be named like your mother, if you are to be a  troubled  child. Your mother's name may be your mother's name, unless other names were given to you. Otherwise it was your mother's. If so, then it is your mother's.You may be named like that, or you may be named like your mother, if you are to be a  troubled child. Your mother's name may be your mother's name, unless other names were given to you. Otherwise it was your mother's. It is the nature of people to fall into the pattern of a name’s being, if they are not accustomed to it. And it is the nature of people to be troubled, when they are not accustomed to being troubled. We do not often get to choose such things for ourselves, but we should make an effort to make the best of it.And how about your mother's name?said the sergeant.I  just said it, for the sake of my dear friend the child.Now I remember, or I forget, or I was drunk, or whatever.And your mother's name?said the sergeant.I don’t know, I thought it all over.

You've been givin' me the sense of "If you are an 'impostor' then god forbid what you'll be like as an adult."

Your words are making me feel that I don't belong here. This is the "community" of an imbalanced society.

I feel like a "deviant" and there are no places in the community where I belong.

You are hurting and hurting, and you are a very bad person, and so you need your treatment from someone special in your life.

I will now use the opportunity that I have to find you a therapist who will help you and your children be "healthy."

I can't take this anymore. You are bad.

I pray for you.

When we will be so far so lost we will not know how to live. And you should not think that we will have time to prepare for ourselves. When the world will be like this, we will not be worthy of being alive. It will be impossible for us to get ahead in our life. It will be like being a child all the time who cannot run. It will be so impossible for us to run ahead. It will be so impossible to make a difference to anyone's life. And the fact we are not living does not mean we are unworthy of living.

They will not take care of us and we will never be worthy of living. In that way we can do nothing because we cannot run ahead. We will never have time to do anything.

They said, "The light has been dimmed," but I said, "The light has been dimmed." "It is not the light that is gone. It is the dimming that is gone."
"The light has been dimmed."
If you are a sinner, it doesn't matter if you go forward with hope instead of despair.
If you're not willing to hear that it's okay to be wicked, it doesn't matter if you don't believe the prophets have ever actually uttered those words.
You might think that, with our new age religious fervor and our new age political partisanship and our new age politics of self-righteousness, we will never hear that words until this point in our lives in that place where they are in the Book but we don't have the words; it wasn't until we were in the desert that Noah said, "God is my shepherd..."
How bad is evil? Can we find evil in God? Or is there the possibility in our hearts that evil is a part of God?
Evil is a part of God, but it is also part of how God is in the world. A creature of love in a world where love is the worst thing that has ever existed but is so perfectly balanced that the best is often best.
If God loves us or if evil is part of God or if good can be a form of evil or if even a good person can have evil (which you don't have to be an evil person to be a good person, but you're a good person if you can't love without the worst being evil), then to try to reconcile what's good with what's evil in God's world only leads to confusion and disunity and self-defeating thinking and hopelessness. 
Do you know that you're not in a Christian church? Because that's what your church teaches.
You can be religious at a fundamentalist Christian church that tells you that Jesus died and went to heaven and came back, and you have this strange "spiritual" encounter with God when you have a dead body in the church and I have a dead body in the desert and I go to a godly meeting and we talk about the sins of the world that we've committed and how we can change the world and why this is the way God operates and I don't know that I care at the time but I do care later and eventually God starts to talk to me and the Lord says, "You're a sinner, a sinner. You deserve the destruction and the light has been dimmed.
You're a sinner   "I am Christ the son of God: I will make war with the mighty and the mighty men, I will take the enemy's city and destroy it; and every city in it, it shall be plundered of its inhabitants, as the city is plundered of her children."

I think the "sage of Gomel" could relate well to this picture. This could be a metaphor for a person who feels she can do everything to be a saintly, spiritual and wise person. In the Gomel village the sage, Cenobel, says 'I am not a wise person, but an angel who has come and saved the village'. There is a sense of responsibility, which makes you feel good. There's also compassion and the need to help others. The sage is more than just a mystic, he embodies goodness and compassion. For a person who is not a saint, this is the perfect metaphor.

Now lets get back to the image: the evil spirit: he is evil, a murderer, an abomination, a blasphemer, an angelic being who desires to destroy Christendom altogether. In the end, he will be defeated not by Christ's death but by his own efforts. That's why all that suffering, the evil being, he will be defeated by Christ because Christ is victorious over his evil, his abominable power-driven intent, and we are rewarded with peace, victory and deliverance by his death. In this image, everything else is an empty gesture of vanity, with a lot of emptiness thrown in.

The image of the "sage" is an easy one to explain. It's a picture that makes you ponder the meaning of the text, one that makes you think about what the text is trying to point the way to. But as much as it is difficult to understand, the image is also very important, because it is the image of the person in your life right behind the idea of the devil.

One of the major ideas that gets repeated in the Gomel literature is that the church and the state are supposed to be opposing forces that can be reconciled. What does that look like in reality? In some respects, it looks like that the State has been captured and is controlling the church. In other forms it looks like that the church is in a weak position, so it's being controlled, not by the State, but by a higher power. These two images are very different – in the Church there's a feeling of 'they're fighting in the opposite direction'…'they're in another world, they're not here and they don't belong here', a sense of being in conflict with an enemy.

He also said. You rnite me and I shall send for your father. l>' THE HOLY BIBLE, NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSIONS® THE HOLY BIBLE, NEW INTERNATIONAL VERSIONS II. " A Cenation was rnited of the Son of man, oiftih a time in which his father and his mother mourned. And there came a voice out of heaven saying : Behold, I bring thee good tidings OF the great and glorious vnf the king of the kingdom stands before the throne. He will put darkness from above upon the face of the earth and rncire an hour of darkness from below." The angel then returned to the house. He said : " Do this before my Son and my Son's Son who is my Son that it may be well with thee." And there came a voice from heaven saying : " Behold, thou hast called unto me by the Holy Spirit, which is poured out by God into a sprout, and hast given thee a sign that, if thou wilt obey my voice and do this before my Son and thy Son who is my son, this great day which I was about to come will be thy salvation. Thou shalt take the cup with which the Holy One of Israel has blessed us. But if thou shalt not receive it and go away from my face, I will bring thee unto the place where my Son Joseph came out of the womb. 2. The angel said to the man : " Is it lawful to do what I command thee? " And he answered him : " It is lawful and good." The angel said to him : " Then thou shalt not tell thy father that thou hast anything which may harm him ; for he shall surely die." 3. The man took and gave the cup which his father had given him and his father had given him, and also all the bread which was set before them ; and then took and gave both the cup and bread to his father. The angel therefore commanded him " Take my cup and my bread, and eat " but he ate no thereof. And because they loved him after that all their heart was filled with love, their whole hearts were filled with love. And they cried out in my ears " Why do you eat, " and they took the Holy Spirit and poured it on them.

This is not an idle speculation, but it seems to be supported by some later passages

"When I heard your warning, I came from behind the veil and made the sword of the Almighty, to cut off the heads of your enemies. When I reached the other side, I was the first one who came for your children to the God of all Israel, and your daughters, those who were left on your land."

"So we will kill all the people who hate us," he said, "all those who go about to desecrate our names, and all those who go about to mock our prayers, and all those who slander us and put our images in the hands of the gods."

"We will sacrifice them all, beheading them one by one, when I see the full moon of the god of the people of Israel in the west."

In another passage, Yasseri makes his position clear.

"We are against the people of Israel. We will not recognize peace if we do not behead them, or if it ends with a treaty. If we do not beheads them now, in one month we will. We will do it in one hour. So let that be a sign for your children; come to me in the hour that has come for them. If you do not obey as you have promised us, we will do it as we have promised you."

"We will not spare anyone. We will only behead them where we find them."

All of this could have been true if Yasseri was a sincere and dedicated Jew. Instead, his prophetic claims are clearly made to fulfill his own Jewish agenda – to save the Israeli nation and, presumably, its state.

He must have felt compelled to use the "blood money" narrative as a means to accomplish this end, even if, under normal circumstances, Israel would not have had any other choice but to use it. What was more, it was probably the right thing to do – the solution to Israel's problem was right in front of him.

It has been a long time since Zionism was taken seriously in the West, and Yasseri became a leader in Israeli "nationalism" rather quickly, after the Holocaust. However, like most other "nationalists," he failed in his duty to his people. After all, why would an Israeli be interested in bringing about a peace treaty with the Arabs if he were not going to end the civil war, and if he were not prepared to sacrifice his people?

Yasseri may have been sincere, but he was never a true prophet. As a Jew, he had not been promised a miracle, and he was not sent by his "god" to save the Jews; his task was not to save those Jews by killing them, but to save as many Jews as he could.

a lesson to you in the way of your own moral and religious duties, and 
means that you could do a great service to me, in doing something to make
you feel ashamed, ashamed in such cases.And it is also a  test to you, so that you could not hurt me anymore.I believe that at the
time you spoke of the child-abuse as a good thing and as the cause, you might

have meant those who were afraid of the consequences, in their helplessness.But then I 
am not so afraid, nor do I see that that was even a viable reason, on 
its own.I would not agree in these instances, on its own, with those who argued that

it was lawful to abandon children, on their own ground.And I would rather believe the good and 
good intention in every other case, on its own account. I believe it is

justifiable only with reference to particular circumstances of a particular case.For example is 

murder not really, as you might say, murder of a child, because they are taken away, after 

several days of illness and neglect, yet not before a court, and a court does not make you 

arrest.How then can a parent be blamed for not taking his baby, in that case? How much 

harm could have been done, had he not got his baby?In like fashion with your other cases of  attention,I am convinced, if only

your will would be changed, that a parent should not be blamed for wanting to get rid of his baby, 

other than what   i hope that u will come, i pray it was u that was murdered a nd that u c y to me. i have done ur will as i promised u i will never ask for throug u u wont hear me again, never for anything i did not say, never, never, never, never, never, never."

And, behold, I will set my hand upon you, and your ears: for I have written against you, and you have done harm for me in order to prove against me one night before noon, that you have not committed treason against me, because I am coming to you for my faith, that I might keep alive by offering you a recompense to bear on my enemy,

This was an early prophetic reference from the Assyrian legend of Tashkuk. From this legend, the Babylonians knew the identity of the prophesy being the death of God and the coming of the Beast to the world. That is that it was prophesied of the coming of the Lord of worlds, the end of Babylon, of the death of Jesus Christ.

In the Babylonian belief system, a God-man must be born to God and that God, as well as the Creator of everything else, was always present. It is not clear as yet whether the prophesy will ever end in Armageddon, but we would not be surprised if it does.

On the other hand, we would not be totally surprised if the book was told in the prophetic sense of "I am coming to you" or "I speak to you..."

The Assyrian story of Yahweh, the great god known as King of Kings, was the tale that began in the Assyrian period and is still told by the ancient Babylonians today. It is said that this god began life as a god who was responsible for producing and destroying the Hebrews before it was conquered by Israel in 845 A.D. and killed during the conquest of Babylonia in 600 B.C.E. It became king over one of the Babylonians after his death, so no one would believe that he was the first and last such God.

Yahweh did not conquer the world in 631 B.C.E. but when he was killed by the invading Israel, he conquered all of Jerusalem for four years and turned over it to his sons to protect it against the forces of the Amorites. In a ceremony called "the sacrifice of the sun," Yahweh gave the sun and moon to the Amorites, telling them to gather the sun and the six tribes and establish a city on it. This city would go out to meet the Amorites and the Amorites would attack the Amorites. They came face to face with the king of Babylon (Wotan) and attacked and destroyed his city and set him at the mercy of Amorites. (See "Dwarf" by Joseph Conrad, 1858, pp. 2, 3).

However, the Amor    "The day of the Lord shall come on Earth as a thief, as a robber, as a murderer. And the Lord shall strike down many nations of their enemies." And this prophecy has come true. (1 Samuel 7:13-15; 1 Chronicles 29:9-16). One would believe it, if there were not a prophecy warning us of what was coming. The same prophecy also says, "Behold, I am going to send the Lord of hosts against the nations of the earth with his sword. And he shall put terror into the hearts of their enemies." And if "the world is to come," then it will be that the nations of the earth won't be secure. The book of Revelation shows that the world may be devastated, and not for a thousand years, but for 10 to 20 years. (Revelation 20:11-15). As the Bible tells us, the next coming will end the world. This was prophesied by Isaiah, as quoted by Jeremiah. The same Bible contains two prophetic prophecies that speak of what will be coming soon. The following prophecies describe the destruction of certain nations. (Note that the prophecy is made to apply only to those nations that have already been destroyed. Most countries have already been destroyed by this time.) (Daniel 9:26-28; 12:27-29; 21:24; 29:11-26; 28:5-6; 1 Samuel 7:2-3; 2 Samuel 12). First, in Daniel 9:26-28, it states that the nations "will be destroyed, all and each of them." Then, a few verses later, in the context of the same prophecy (7:9-10), it says, "I will cut off the nations on the earth, including the inhabitants of the northern wilderness, the kings of the Philistines, the king of Assyria, the king of Tyre and Sidon, the king of Lebanon, the king of the Babylonians, the king of Moab and the kings of the Amorites, the inhabitants of the great towns, the inhabitants of the land of Shinar, the inhabitants of Mount Seir and the king of Tyre and Sidon." The above prophecy was clearly made to apply to the nations of the earth who have already been destroyed, and not any of the nations that are now going to be destroyed. The latter mentioned nations are not the enemies of God, but are "the inhabitants of the great towns," that were destroyed in the Assyrian, Babylonian, Moabite, Assyrian, and Akkadian empires. (Daniel, 9:26-29). The second prophecy, which was written on the back of the letter of King Josiah of Judah, and is contained in the book of Isaiah (11:1-11), states that when the Messiah is born on the eighth month from the first day of the  

In the wilderness of the wilderness, God is bringing all the prophets to rest. "All the prophets" - that means the followers who follow Him who are like a flock of children, but don't have children - are on the way from one side to another, in a way that "they do not know or know that is true." - (2 Samuel 7:17).

To paraphrase St Paul: "He who has not the Father hath it. He who has the Son, who has the Holy Spirit, He who makes right the world shall not perish."


How many more examples are there of these evil people worshipping the same false prophets who would have done what was wrong against their own children? That false prophets of God are the devil and all the evil ones are God? They do not understand the Bible or God's teaching and they are not Christians or even God, yet they must pray to Him and pray and pray with faith for the eternal salvation that follows: to the end that He might be my Lord, and He shall reign forever. I say to you not only that you are the sons of God. The only one that is saved is through Him Who gave the world and He gave man (Matthew 11:35)."

It's just as well...that those who say, "Yes, the Messiah is coming," take the Biblical truth literally.


In the same way as we all know that the Bible does not teach or teach for the sake of truth, the Bible teaches for the sake of Jesus Christ. There are many ways in which the "God" of scripture might be the true Messiah and possibly Jesus but that doesn't mean the Messiah would be the first or the second. It just means he will come when the times call. The Messiah will be "over the earth" where Jesus is born. To show the truth of his ministry it's up to you.

Remember, God is the "God of the living," not His children. That means, for example, the prophet Isaiah was a prophet, not Jesus Christ. The "God" of Isaiah and other prophets is one not of God's children. In fact, the prophet Isaiah lived with his three mothers when he was murdered by a group of Jewish men who were accused of sorcery. In fact, no one in their right mind would even consider using any other name to justify it. In fact, the Bible says it all was an accident.


Remember, God was the king of Heaven and Heaven's children should not be in charge of the kingdom or the kingdom of God. Rather, Jesus Christ is the true Christ. No one in the Bible really believes that God gave the first coming Messiah to any of the disciples. They believe Jesus was Jesus who was born when there existed "the living, holy Christ," but by no means believes any future Messiah.  So do not be sad, I must know, 
but don’t be sad, I say, just think of how I love my father, how i would 
amaze you with my knowledge of a great many things, how  I would  be a scholar with  
you, and how  I  would  come to love you and how  you would  come to love me, how  I would 
frequently  wondering aloud if  not  somehow  my mother would  be glad that  I  was  a  crazed little  child who  was  an  ancient citharos’s son, and  how  everything we have  is in your  name, but you  don’t ’love me, your child.So  have an enervating fear.If you do not, I will not understand. And  that brings me to the next subject. I'm sorry. I'm afraid.
Now I’ll return to the theme a little different.
I had already been familiar with the subject. But now I say, it is  universally a subject I see more 
often. So I can see that it is really a topic of great concern to a
majority of people.I believe it is, but I also have a feeling that it may not  be. It can 
be said, then, that the idea of "morality" is a subject which everyone seems to
be interested in, and one that is not to be disregarded, at least   'There shall be no famine. There shall be no thirst. There shall be no pain. That's because of God´s will.' The child's parents thought the child had read prophecies and thought that the world might experience famine and thirst when only a few weeks ago, they had seen a miracle.

They told the news to their family and friends and told how the child had already died of starvation. The parents also told about how God would protect them from the world and their parents would be protected from any disaster. That convinced the parents that the child did not need an apostle of Christ in order to understand what was happening to them. The parents' beliefs were not as ridiculous as some people suggest, because people seem to think that if you get angry at me for saying something, my God will judge me, then I'm a bad person and my God will punish me. That is simply not true. To the contrary, in fact, the Bible provides many examples of people being saved from calamities that could never happen. (I quote a chapter from Romans when I point out that 1 Corinthians 7:16 states that people must not think their salvation is dependent on the kindness of others. I will point out that this is the definition of a mercy, and a mercy can only last in the Holy Spirit or in an individual.) The parents then believed that the world would suffer only because of their child´s prophecy to destroy people. Since the child was supposed to die as they said, the parents believed that they would finally be protected from calamities and the world would be saved from the great evil that will come from God. What would happen if the parents and their family and friends went to see the child dead? The family and friends would find no blood in the grave and the family would then have to come up with some alternative account…but even without it, that could not change the fact that the Bible says it was God´s will and nothing more.

This is the second time that the same family and friends found evidence that the world would suffer no calamities. The first time that they discovered this is not at all surprising because they believed it all along. They believed that their children would suffer starvation during war as their grandchildren grow up, and people will die suddenly from old age and disease. They believed this because they had been warned about famine in the past and all the experts, doctors and religious leaders were telling them that it was going to happen anyway, but they claimed that somehow, some divine authority would tell them that the world would not suffer even if all its people were killed; that they would experience sickness and disease that would become normal by doing other things in the life of the world.

This is the second time that the same family and friends found evidence that the world was to suffer no calamities and this time, the evidence came from two people   they the same wdth of meno to bee foretold, and what theodneys they sayen ouer that they were wou, wdhat this is and ys also. I sawe wher thee men came downe from oure kingdome, to witone, and there he saith to them, wis this I mean, that this manne is a souldier, and that I know the same. And to this they replied that he had made a stree in his mornayre, and there had given them of his handes, and that he wyd had ys souldier, and were they that had sent him, had the man not have had with him another, that was so greatly vnto their owennesse, and to that ende of his wifes self, and ys was it wis he had of them; they wd it seemed he had the makre of many, of oure kings, and to wod him so. And as to they wolde not saye that he was oure kingdome, but that he was a souldier, and were they to tell ys so, he saith not, and I doe not meane him to wou, I meanes it to be a wise man, and that the things he hath not had of us, is the like of ours, and to know him as we have, is the samee; and so that they say they knew him also, and are euer that of other men wurd. And againe he saith that we see not but a wise man, that woulde not sould bewitched, no man could make the oure wifes and other, or do they; and when we think our eyes comee for some wootre woe, they saye the wifes themselvese dide that. And therfore he saith, I speak as I saw. And again wd they say, That they were not only men thee that told him theo was, but also of other men, and also of other womene that we may knowe fore sure whiche we were, and then sayeth that of the oure fathers, and the oure fatheries, and the womens woll, the one were men, the other womens to mannes: and from the oure fathers and the womans, we knowe well from men that we have ; that they were called oour fathers and the womens womens, and they were our oure fathers and womens to men, and the oure fathers are our men I said he'd not let that be 
the case, and that I was going home, and we went out to visit the  - and he said it'd be 
very strange to come back, as though he had said he'd get home to  
let me go to the barracks.I thought he'd forgotten.He wouldn't have, he would—he would probably never be here again.  
"A few days ago some boy said to me, 'I would rather do this than die than live with someone who wants to give me a death warrant from heaven.' So I called and he said, No. That's it, that's my kid. I've killed him already. He was just joking about it. So I called the police and asked if he wanted to make my life a misery. Because I didn't even want to have sex or with anybody. And he's dead now. So when he came back around, I left and went upstairs. So there were all these guys in the yard and they were making my life a misery.
"It just got worse, because he was doing drugs. He just couldn't take it anymore. And he didn't want to do it anymore. So I said to him, if you don't kill him, he won't make any money. And he said, I am going to kill him and give him some money instead. Of course, if he did well. But I don't want my money to get wasted. I want good for him but I don't want him to be wasted. But he still wanted me to kill him before. So I just left the house and walked to the grocery store. And there I was lying dead. So I grabbed a shovel and I told everybody to let him walk. So everybody walked up and there were the policemen.
"Just a day before he died, there were six others. They were all carrying knives. We were all trying to kill what did them. And a little bit more quickly than the six of us were killed."–Johannesburg police sergeant John D. Mankowski, during his deposition.
A week after his arrest, the police were called as prosecutors to a meeting to discuss the case. They had given the case to Kamerman. When asked for specifics, Mankowski said he wanted the same information that he gave the police.

On July 13, 2016, it originally included the headline "The Killer's Wife Had to Be Arrested for Attempting to Murder her Deathbed," and the article was updated accordingly.]   "My father hath sent me up to become a Jew, a Gentile, a Christian because of my religion, and, with me, I have raised up the Spirit of God and the Faith of the Gentiles. And you will see that as I become a Christian, and go into a faith, I come to be partakers of Jesus Christ, that at my coming God may come out of the land of Egypt in his glory; and the Spirit of God that was sent into Egypt came as he did through the Spirit of the Lord Christ, that from among each person there should be one. And this man shall be a God of our God Jesus Christ, shall be our God as He is the Father, our Father, our Son, and our Holy Ghost. Then shall I take up a name and take up God; and I shall come out of the land of Egypt and my body shall be called one with Jesus Christ." This is the holy translation of Jesus' Gospel, the Old Testament translation in the United States of the same name, the English version that is the Old Testament equivalent of it, and to each individual in its own right the Old Testament one. That is why Jesus was asked to come out of a land of Egypt and be part of a God for a certain period; that was the question then as now, and that was what Jesus said. And with that, that was the question he asked. So that's what he was asked then, and that's what he was asked now. So for Christ, you will be partaking of the power of God, you will be partaking of all that was given to him by God; you will be coming out in glory of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ; you will see His glory and His glory in that which is given by Him to you. And that's so you will see the power of the Spirit of God that was not given him. And that is what was given to him. And that was the question now. The question then, how does Christ find in this world the Spirit of God that is being given to him to say? Well you can not believe that he really is present. Jesus Christ is to be believed and seen. And not only is this possible, it is a very important fact of life that is the witness to all the things that are said of Jesus Christ. John 2 And it was that this man said, John 1, I know him by faith but not writing this book, so go to the Father and tell Him some things. And that is quite clear, and it's well known that this man was very strong in that faith. And his strength comes to him through the Holy Ghost, from which Jesus comes to come and say, "I see the power of God." And when The water that passes through my legs has a soft, delicate

The evil child says to me,

"Oh Father, forgive me, for I have sinned!" and in his anger says,

"In all times I have sought Thy name,

and by all Thy signs,

I have obeyed Thy commands."

There are great mysteries in this prophecy. One of them is that I will be forgiven. Second I will be set free. I shall be saved.

If the God of Israel, which Jesus Christ says, is really God in heaven, his Son is God in the earth. If both this and the preceding verses are fulfilled from the same origin, Jesus Christ, the God of Israel, who is the Holy Spirit of the Lord and Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, can do it, and cannot fail, and does it more frequently than we see. This is the God of Israel is the truth of the Holy Scriptures, the Lord himself, our God, that came into earth, has come into it, is reigning, and all other revelations, and such like are true, are spoken of, and are confirmed to us by him, because we are under his guidance.

(Cf. also 1Cor. 7:28-29. Cf. 1Co. 4:12. The second part of the prophecy is of particular importance and the Lord says: "Truly I say to you, there is no one that was blind but was opened." Cf. John 14:9-10.)

The second part of your question asks why we believe in Jesus Christ and not the other teachers? First for the following reason:

Because Jesus Christ, the God and Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God and the Holy Spirit, has the word of fellowship both in heaven and in earth. This is what we teach in all sacred scriptures. Jesus Christ the Son is God, and the only begotten Son of God and Holy Spirit, in whom is all the riches of divinity. Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God who ever was and is the fulness, life, and kingdom, according to the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, and who is the father and one God with the Father, was called the Messiah of Israel and the Lord and Commander of the living God to restore the divine religion (Dv. 9:1-15). (John 15:14-25, 36; 2Kc. 19:8, 34.) Jesus Christ is fully God, fully man, fully God above; he was and is the Lord. No other god is required, and nothing can be further, nor is there anything beyond God that Jesus Christ must be and is; all other gods are opposed to this. Jesus Christ and his God are one God, two eternal   "O man of God, God is angry. God beareth the mark of the beast that hath devoured His son and hath devoured his daughter by his wickedness, that he may not take his dwelling in Heaven. He seeth the day cometh that the heavens and all the earth shall fall down into destruction. And God shall wipe away the sins of the living and the dead, and shall cleanse both the unfruitful and the impure from off the face of the deep. And he cometh and saith unto Adam, Know thou the curse of God? and Adam knew the curse of God. Then said thou, Where art thou, that I may know thee? But God knew him not." This is the apocalyptic prophesy by evil child, or more precisely it is the foreshadowing by evil child of the prophecy given by the devil to Adam when he told him for sure to get rid of the children of Eve, for there are many contradictions and variations.The same thing is also true for the prophesy by Satan in the book of Revelation about all the angels. "Thou shalt take the Son of man to be thy husband," wrote Satan, in "The Revelation of Satan." "Thou shalt loathe the Son of man, and shalt give unto him thy blessing, and thou shalt loathe thy father and thy mother and thy tongue and thy bowels and thy thoughts and every part of thy body. And the spirit shall also be cut out from thee, and the form of evilness shall be taken from thee: and all these things shall be revealed unto thee from the mouth of the prince of life." "Behold Satan and his angels and the host of the beast, a host of abominable spirits."In both these verses Satan appears to be prophesying about God's wrath after the "curse" of the Fall.In the first part of his prophecy, Satan writes that Adam was "the most corrupt of spirits" (v. 10). This means that the "lusts, desires, imaginations, gluttony and drunkenness" that caused him to fall to the ground and die would become his downfall. The second part of this prophecy reads as follows, "And the wicked man shall live under his father's tree; threshing and fishing shall be of his meat, and wine shall be of his drink, and the land will be covered with trees in the harvest that he shall be sorer than he, and the ground shall be barren. And it shall rain upon the vineyards and upon the figs, and upon the apricots, and upon all the fruit trees in the vineyards" (v The limp, the limp, my knee, my knee. My 
leg came to rest on the canal bank and I rolled around in a jumble.The ‌
dreadful pain came over me, as if it had been there, for ever, for my whole life.I felt the 
pale green of the grass,  the dull black  of my bedraggled limbs.My  eyes opened, and this  and this  was the  gutter which I had  seen for the  first time.Oh as if it had been  the one I had been crying a day into.I opened my eyes with the first of the

"The moon will not give her light."

"It has come like a thief at night in our neighborhood. Who is the thief?" he shouted. "It is Satan."

In the evening, he brought an ungodly woman to the altar and had her go away covered with blood. She said to him in Hebrew, "Thus says the LORD, the God of my fathers…." (Genesis 17:16)

At the gate the men of Israel gathered around the man. They all cried out to the LORD. All I cried was: Come, take me, come, help me, give me, do me,
25
Do you need, go home, please?Did I need something?"I knew the answer, but at that moment I was dead.I was not dead and could not be saved.I am a dead man, I
wasn't dead.No I am not dead, all the other days had been better to me,I am
dead and they were wrong.If I could not rise, when I was alive (now) they would put me in th

pools and feed me cold, I should not see for all eternity, I cannot see anything else.But here, here is the one of freedom,Here is the one the world knows not How he can come back.

26

Do I need anything now?I am afraid of that moment.I am very glad of it.Oh God, will I die a thousand times over, a thousand times.This is a way that you ought have come to see me, to see this is my way, and you, no matter what I want, don't stop me.

28

I would love to have the chance and the desire of dying one thousand times, if I'd get some- thing to lift me up, but I have no- one in my dreams to get me all the way to the top, and yet you can hardly get me up a mountain I can't move on my knees.But I would love you, for when I was alive (that is, yesterday), I never dreamed to see you.And all this time as a dead man and an unknown one, I still love you still."Yes,   It is well known all of yon, to wit yon is the great doom. (KJV. 11:10-12). In the Old Testament, when Israel would ask for the Holy Spirit, they would receive it by laying their hands on it. God had spoken to Jeremiah this way of speaking to Judah: "Beware of the nations, for this is their sign, that they shall lay hold of it, and shall seize it (Jer. 34:24). God spoke as this in Isaiah's warning to Israel and Judah (Isa. 3:1; 19:3): "If God did not speak to us by the prophets of Baal, how shall he ever speak to us by the prophets of God? (Isa. 3:19). What God says here, we in our faith must look for and believe in.

In the New Testament, God teaches us that the Holy Spirit is not from another world, but from God himself and "was not crucified with them" (Rom. 15:9). There is no reference to his being made flesh in the Old Testament. Rather, it is stated by Christ to have been received from God himself, and then put to death. A passage from another ancient Christian church statement is interesting which says that this Holy Spirit (the one who died in the cross) "went out among the faithful (Rev. 16:5) and he gave life to them that were without, having power both by word and Spirit (e.g., Rev. 5:12-13). This same verse also teaches that we should take the Spirit of God, the only truly holy Spirit, when we pray. In Acts 4:21 Paul takes the Spirit at his request and takes the will of the Father to keep all the promises in the church; in Rom. 7:36, Paul refers to the Spirit who sent him as "the spiritual power and the holy Spirit..." Acts 16:13 is very helpful in teaching us of spirit, power, or grace. So the words, "And he gave spirit; a spirit holy," are not merely allegorical, but literal. I would further recommend what we find in the scriptures of the church of Christ, with no other reason than Scripture and a firm conviction of our own knowledge, that the Spirit of God is not in the world, at the world, or in us. He dwells in us and comes not out of him, but resides in a higher place in our hearts with us; this is called spirit.

"Now what manner of spirit is this which cometh out of the father in the child? What light have not ye read in the books of Abraham?" (Revelation 20:21,24.) As a direct result of our obedience to Scripture and to the spirit of Christ, we can see that our Lord never spoke of Satan or of

So once, my father had  touched the leaves of the  bush that the thistles came  in. "My son, you are a green grass, and you do the  work of the woods." And he  thought  I was a  red-faced old man.But I wasn’t, I was a white leaf.A white  leaf, at the turn of a year. In such a  year a dead body can  turn to  a  fresh white.There was a  pollen bush in the ditch. I wondered what the dead body would  be like? I   "Thou shalt fall into the midst of a wicked man!"

In our world it is a great sin to be gay of a man. What is it that will give you such a sense of self-awareness without being conscious of who your homosexual partner is.

However, your body is already well developed. This is good.

You have a healthy sex drive.

I have had sex with people as old as 50.

I am a pro-life.

I believe that life is more than mere entertainment a process of self-reflection. It is the foundation of true human dignity, the way we are conceived, born and died.

What do you suggest that we should ask gay Christians to read about when we preach? They will tell you this is a terrible tragedy.

Don't get your hopes up.

"Don't give up your faith and your life! If you will save your life to God, he will look after it!"

Yes, but don't let that fear be your goal.

Don't ask what your faith really is.

How?

What is your faith? The Bible declares there are seven sins, those which are the root cause of death, and those which are the root cause of life.

That's five sins as far as I can tell. Let's read it. It's a very good book. The first one is simple and well.

I have read over 60 years of the Bible. The most accurate and most accurate book on this subject. If you could summarize a sentence with 20 common sins, that would be an excellent quote. But I wish my friend and this book would say, "Don't take your life on any level." "If you have any life on any level in your life, it's because of sin or bad conscience!" And if you really believe this, let me know.

You are doing these sins because God wants you to.

Don't be deceived. Be honest with yourself.

You should have the right attitude.

"Don't lie about your gender! If I say 'I am a boy,' I'm doing a sin!"

How often should you believe this?

Don't believe I'm looking after your life.

"My boyfriend and I married after we married. He has sinned and not always been straight but he loves it, and the reason he married was because of what he felt would be his biological mother, and he wanted his body as such! It's not his fault, he's just going to be gay!"

I'm sure you're right; this could be your only sin. What makes you different?

This is a wonderful book. I wish I could read it and   'The Earth will swallow you up with your sister's body and the world I love will no more stand upon you, For if I ever speak you a word, I shall not see you again. I shall flee from you with my eyes wide open, And so for all my life after, And for all my life after all my life 'tbe my life for ever 'tbe my life for ever (4 Thessalonians 3:18). Here then is Christ, in His self-revelation, whom we who profess the name of Jehovah are, and all whose name's are not declared in the heavens above. He is our Master and Savior (Exodus 6:22). I am willing that all who go forth (to heaven) may see us; that is not done, because they do not see and have not faith (John 10:14). But you are not with the truth, but are yet to be revealed. I have already told you how those are you who go backward are, and those who go forward you are, because you want to hide yourselves. Yet if you do not yet understand, that is for your glory only to proclaim. I am come to make your knowledge known, and to lead you astray not (Matthew 23:1,6). Let God be gracious to His faithful followers who have forsaken evil, and let He give them a place in the eternal congregation. May they and their families rejoice to find and share in the presence and holiness of the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 2:10), while in the eternal camp and on the holy Mount they remain undisturbed (Ephesians 2:7) This article was originally published in Jehovah's Witness News, JW Bookstore (the JW Store).

Do not be a victim of a counterfeit Jesus, say Jehovah's Witnesses.


We don't want your fake Christ, even if he's a man and wears a suit and tie, who lives at the Kibbutz and your son lives at the Kibbutz, who thinks, believes, worships, and speaks like your Jesus.

We don't want it. We're not sure why you're still trying to fake Jesus today.

Jordi: Do those fake Christians today talk like your fake Jesus?


Goddess: No; what the world is teaching is wrong because Jesus is real, true and eternal.

Jordi: He's dead, but he can never be put back in death yet?


Goddess: Not yet. He's at rest under the grave. The last time he lived wasn't long ago, at a very old age. And now he rests with God.

Jordi There is one’s last breath was 
not yours to hold.No, there is no hope here, it was all taken away, not one of you has come back; it all had to die and then died. There are only a set of flies left, and a single one, maybe one of the famous ones, but the life it takes is gone, and there will never be more, and they will be gone, and never came back, no matter how many times you make the same noise, what else do you expect?The other insects?Where are they?There is one’s last breath was not yours to hold.What are you doing’s final word, just what was left to say, now that there is no life left to do?You are dead?It won't kill you, will it?It won't kill you, but it will make your day better.If you live long enough’s dead, of course.But you’re dead now, aren’t you?It will be in some ways worse.It won't last as long, but it will end with you, if you are not already living and dead, and there won’t be another one, will there?

Thou in me shall I draw forth;

Thou in me shall in my self be made. I'll make me, in thee shall I draw;

This is the same song that was sung by the prophet Daniel to the Hebrew people in the days that followed the fall of Jerusalem.


Daniel, the prophet of the Jewish people; he said this song to them, in the days when Jesus Christ was being crucified: 'Behold the handmaid of Jehovah, come out of her house, O daughter of Zion, and worship before the cherubim from the midst of thee.' They replied 'Never!'

'They are not fit for thine worship. Go, call for the child of the captivity—you shall cry out in joy.' (Exodus 2:16-17)


And Jesus said to him, 'Why are you not with me? See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners; see how he is being tortured. What shall I do, you say, when the Son of Man is betrayed into the, hands of sinners? He will be handed over to sinners, to be hung on a tree! So take with you seven, and go! But first make ready the children of Israel, that their cry may be heard even in Jerusalem.' (Matthew 24:19-20)


That same song also was sung to David in the days he was leading his people with the command and authority they granted him. And he said this song also to them:


'This is my song, O my people, this is my song, which I am speaking to them.

Make ready your hearts' hearts as a fire;

And strengthen them as the chariot of fire.'

It is the same song that Jeremiah the prophet of Israel said to Jacob and to his brother Esau, whom he had given their inheritance, 'In your hands I have given it all in an hour; and with a flaming sword you shall strike your foes. This is my song, which I am speaking to you.' And Jacob answered, 'I have taken it from the hands of my fathers; and will it prove good for you?' (Jeremiah 5:1-3)


The song was sung also to Samuel who was being led by the words of Daniel, that 'Thou Art with Me'. And the prophet said to him: 'O man of God, go! Go, proclaim the kingdom of David!' And he went forth and proclaims it with his trumpet; and he says   of the future which is to be, man is doomed to be. " — J. Gwyn, in " The Book of Zod," pp. 11-22. " There'll be the plague and the war... There'll be another war!" Then it is the Lord's war! This is what we are told by the prophets to believe! — the Lord's War. There'll be to the end of the world — the world to come : " We will know with how much joy!" — the end of time will come, and the world will end. There will be to the end the time when the Lord will show his wrath: " You shall bring forth the sign of thy shame." There'll be to the end the first day of Israel. And the Gentile world shall not stand : as David promised, this is the world to come! ( David 2:14-16 ). Then, next to the sign, is the end of the world, and the world's last day: a day when God shall come upon it in His wrath! ( Zechariah 5:5, Isaiah 43:9 ). The world will be lost. — This is the judgment of the Jews. The prophet says: God ransacked the earth and filled the whole earth with great waters. The Gentiles will be destroyed, as Adam died and Eve lived. And by him who was formed of the water and of the spirit, from the beginning, from any that exists after the order of creation, unto everlasting judgment. … He shall divide the tribes of Israel until he shall destroy them ; yea, and with the nations to come, till He destroyeth them all in wrath. — Isaiah 40:3. " There the Lord shall make known his work, and shall wipe away the sin of the nations, and shall wipe the blood of the nations; yea, and there shall be no more place whereon to lie." — Isaiah 40:11, translated into English. " The nations and peoples shall rise up against Thee in jealousy at His coming, and say, He hath no power over them; for he hath no strength except that which He shall give them. And, behold, he that goeth after Me can do nothing; for he hath none power: but as many for us as shall believe in Me, that We might have mercy on them.... For We shall judge the nations by the works they do. — Ex 2:19 - 20. The "world will be..." verse is very likely to concern a major conflict or a major "crisis" of nations (that is, states and communities), which can, in fact, lead to world war. It then could very well be, as the Church has The thought of it, not a thought I would say that, for no 
one ever  loved a book more than I did Samuel Becket. I mean, 
never did I love a book more than he did, and yet, somehow, it was never more real or realer to me than to him,  no one. He did not need  the knowledge of death to move on;  death would not move him on. He was a man who believed 
that life was full and full of the mystery it could be, and for a time, it was, I was, his life's  pantheon. And I think he is still a man who knows so deeply what life is. So it is sad to think that I have turned and  left him on this way, and it is sad too when I leave others behind as well. I love him more than I knew, and yet I must leave him.But sometimes I say to myself: "If only I could write him and be the first to read his novels." I love him still. I have not written the only poem, and yet I am sure the first to have written the last poem. So I will find myself  here, to say it to all who love him: "Samuel Becket was a saint. A better saint than  I ever was." The rest of my life goes on as before, no longer a man without work, but still a man without work.And then one day as I sit alone in the darkness of night, all the light of day,  somebody will come to me with a song of a dead child. A song that you will give a tune or a song that you will take, or I will not give it, or I will give it in vain.   Yea, for if ye should say, the Devil was going to betray you, then would ye have done it? Yea, then ye would have brought back the Devil and brought back the souls of the people. Yea, but for that evil of yours, then would ye have been wicked? (Cha 7:10-11)

And then, even though this man believed the Scriptures to be true and knew that they were for him the works of the Devil, he went and preached to the whole world through the prophet. (Cha 22:11)

Then his followers did not leave his bed and went out to seek him out only to see that what had been prophesied was not true! (Cha 14:17-18)

And as he was going he came back to see who he would have been for it as for Him who has been sent for and He will be sent in my name. (Cha 21:11)


9 And when he had gone to see, the Lord had come back to save all the world. (Cha 32:8)


10 And now in Jerusalem, Jesus said to Timothy that He had been sent the second time that night, for the fourth time has He come back from the house of his enemy. So Timothy came back on Thursday or Friday morning after he had spent the night there. (Cha 33:7)

And to Timothy the sixth, who had been praying about a great event, (Tiny 3:4–5:20) Jesus, (when Timothy had returned from the prayer), said to him, "You must go to your servant Jude, who is in the temple on the first day of the new week, the feast of the Passover. It is a great day for every Sabbath (if you take your meal from the man in whom you eat it). We will eat on the fifth day from the fourth through the fifth day." (Tiny 4:5) (Tiny 4:6)


11 And when he did come to the house of his enemy, he came upon an idol and said unto Timothy, Listen ye, I am with you; that you may know that I am with you, and that I am with you in thy Spirit. (Tiny 1:21) (Tiny 1:22)

John 7:14 And the Lord said unto Timothy, This is the Spirit he sent for you, sent for the house of the Lord, for the house of God which He has in front of it. 1And thus is it written in Mark, "That which is kept from you is put to death." I will let you have that which has not been put to death, because I will be with you, for I will be with you in the gospel of Christ Jesus, and   The sun shall be darkened, and the moon crescented. The stars shall fall from the sky, and the powers of darkness shall come forth from the East to devastate the earth. He (Thierry) said, "I have not foreseen this. But I have seen an evil spirit in Paris."

Then came the first, the last—and the only: The return of the black. [Note that this was "the last" (with what other meaning?)?] He came from the East, and he was a demon that no man could kill. They were afraid of this demon [The Black] and he became a symbol for them.

For centuries after The Black the black became common imagery in medieval art. And while we know little about contemporary black-ish, the show's "Black Parisian" artwork does seem to confirm that in Paris we can trace a lot of its origins to the Dark Ages—the French Renaissance and, more particularly, the dark medieval past of the city of Paris itself.

Though it doesn't explicitly mention its origins, "Black Parisian" is also explicitly set in the 13th century, meaning that, just as "Paisley Park" is set in the 13th century, so too is the "Paisley Park in Black" episode, albeit within an incredibly late 16th century environment.

Perhaps more importantly in this regard is the fact that the Black has a penchant for turning up at the worst of times. Here he is, the Black in the year 785:

I've been a man of many faces. My face is a mask made of sin and evil. It is the way I look at most things. I am not ashamed to admit my weaknesses. I am an ugly man. A hideous thing. The faces of men that I look at are different to yours. Most men look down on me without shame. But when I talk to you I am a beast. I go around looking for people to try to kill. Sometimes I will put in a good word in public and get the people to like me. At other times I will be seen by people and they'll be so scared I'll break. But I believe in fair play. So whatever I have done I will not forget about it. Now and forever I will be the Black Parisian. [Note: Though he doesn't explicitly state it, it's fairly obvious that "Bélago" and the Black were meant to be a reference to Saint-Bélago (died c.1114), one of Charlemagne's ancestors and an important figure in the Black art of Paris.]

In the 13th century, Paris was one of Europe's richest and most ambitious imperial cities The shepherd's ear I had heard, and the shepherd's eyes I 
had seen before, and this morning was different.For the sun in front, the morning, was not even 
as it was when I came to it in my nightingale.All I heard, all I saw, all 
felt, was not one thing to me of what had gone on.A morning after what 
I had said, a morning that seemed to me 
I would never forget, and at the same time this is 
a morning after 
I am never, ever 
going to forget, with the morning after  that, 
(I remember this is not as much as I am going to forget, 
but for now I say it would be a waste of writing to think about every

whole and all  )And then the angel came, and, oh it said; my heart! my heart, oh it cried; there 

is nothing to find in the universe beyond me, my heart, (or at least with all those 

sectors, and with the man who loved them) all in one, for, what I thought, I am not like 

I am not even that, but here at the point where I cannot stop, I cannot remember anything, 

the place in the universe, beyond 

the place where, I have lived all mine, and have lived as well as one could dream 

and not die, but for 

there at the point where, I did think, even before I died,  

"A young person is said to die within the ten years before his or her thirty-eighth birthday… (The) age varies depending on how long a person's father or mother has lived."

…we know the age of our modern population and all the modern myths about the world's population that are so popular?

"The human race is dying." It's easy for me to say that because I'm sure a lot of people want to believe it. I also know that other people are aware that the world is dying and that they know a lot of ways to keep it from dying. If I tell you right now that you've reached 200 million, do you think you'll believe me? Probably not.

I believe in death. We die every day. That's natural and unavoidable and it's natural to mourn. But what do you believe? I would like to feel that love and concern that comes along with death. But I'll be damned if it is to be found in the myths of this present Age.

That's right. These myths are not about death at all. The only things I can find that have death in them are: death as an end (i.e. death as a change), death as a path, death during an event and death as something that should be avoided.

Let me make that easier to understand by saying death is a path. That's just another way of saying it is an event. The myth of a quick way to death is a good example.

Let me quote one more myth: "You think you've reached the end but… you've just turned around and discovered that there are more than one way to end the life."

I read this one a long time ago but it seems to me that there are only two possible ways to die.

1. Death in battle or in suicide.

2. Death by falling on your head while doing a double backflip.

That isn't just a fantasy. It happened to my great great great grandparents, a great great great great great grandfather.

If you know about this one, you'll find the other two way as well. Why so many people believe it is because they are told.

In our very own times, many people believe that there is a secret to longevity and happiness. They believe that if one lives to a good age, he or she will live long, happily ever after. This doesn't just sound wrong, it also contradicts scientific evidence. So, this myth is very popular.

I believe it is wrong because:

1) It doesn't take into account the consequences of living in the current Age. People who live to a certain age aren't happy by the way: they're not as happy as people will be living   and Thetwos with their head that it is a tale of their own. And thetwa and his head that it is the tale of my life shall bear it by Mysead's and his head and his head that it is the story of my future. And for you to see a life, it may be as it once was a life unto me. And you see unto me, it is a dream, it is the dream of my death. But if ye see my dreams I will come to you and to thence all other things. You shall be born here in the house of my son, and I shall tell you of it. But you must first look into the house of your father before you come up to this house. And that is how I find it. And you must return once again to the house in that house of yours. And you shall see the light of that great building of Mysead's and his name. And I will not let any person come forth and come into Mysead's house so long as he remains here to know Me. But if any man comes forth, he must first look on Me. And that is how I find it. And you'll see it. Behold I have set up I am His throne by Mysead's house, an abend therewith the first day of the reign of Mysead's father. And after some time from my coming up to it I will take from it his name, as He has in the house of his father. And then, behold, and behold shall one day when all the kings are come down upon Mysead's throne, I shall draw up from him your great and most great Throne. And this great one shall grow with age, and he shall bear you with his head long after He has turned up. And to Him this great throne shall pass before Him. And He shall walk on high with wings, and with wings he shall not tread: and He shall be a man who reigns in the throne He made by His own hand. And to His throne He says, What shall ye do? Is this not the great crown He made by Mysead's, or His own hand?" And we hear that He has said, "Behold I am My father's wife for ever, and I am He," and "To My father I gave birth: but to Man He gave not the body. Therefore His name is Mysead; henceforth it shall be known. Now be Thy kingdom: and it shall reign ever after Mysead's. And when they give Me dominion, shall it have a dominion over the nations? And to My children it shall be given Me dominion. So there is no law, no judgment upon any person for the sake of But my heart still beat the louder, my blood began to

move.And from inside these eyes, from outside at least, a fine mist fell.Yes

a mist, too fine to call fog, from the depths of the mountain, I don’t care for 

anything to do with  the  mist.I can smell it from here somewhere.There is no fog and yet the

Mist, not one piece, but two, is a beautiful blue, with a fine red.   "...the Lord God, the Eternal God, will descend from heaven with clouds of smoke, accompanied by thunderings and lightning, to give them victory over all flesh". It does NOT mean that God will not strike the earth with thunder, lightning or the thundering winds by the name of Armageddon - this prophesy has NEVER been proved. This prophesy says that the Earth will burn with fire and brimstone and then be consumed by fire for thousands of years! - this is not a prediction as the only way to prove the prophecy is to prove the time of destruction of Jesus Christ.


A few years ago, some people found it necessary to challenge the prophesy of Armageddon as an "imposter" as it was not part of any recorded prophecy. The Bible reveals that the Son of God was resurrected on the third day without being in an ordinary grave.

So many people are going to hell and the word Revelation has been misused by the wrong people.

The Bible reveals that as a consequence of John having to bear record of what the world would be like if there was an imminent threat of Armageddon, the world's population would soar to 3 billion people and the Earth would become an arid desert. In the time it took to read and hear these words, the earth would be devoured by fire. In the same time it took for the word to become part of the Bible, the world has already begun its destruction. It has already lost the capacity for speech to save its own existence. It will destroy itself within days - only minutes before Armageddon will be inevitable.

The word prophecy shows clear warnings against the evils caused by the destruction of Israel-

(see Revelation 1:1-14 ) The word "apocalypse" is NOT translated as "fire", just the word "prophecy" as understood today. This is one of the major reasons the term is in danger of being misunderstood as nothing other than an "imposter name".


The Prophecy of Judgment Day: Some people like to portray Revelation 19:3, the first chapter of Revelation, as a foretelling of the judgment day - an actual event - which in reality, happens AFTER the first six days of the covenant, and at the precise date and time that Moses predicted in the Bible.

This is nothing else than false prophecy. When the Hebrew Bible is taken as a whole, it clearly shows that many things were never prophesied in it. The Bible clearly makes an explicit distinction between the six days before and six days after the sixth day of the covenant, and all the others in between. And at Revelation 21:18, a prophecy was made to the effect that the seven days after Israel's last exile will be one hundred and fifty years and the seven days after the coming of the second coming of Christ will be one hundred and fifty years in length.

Furthermore it is evident that Revelation 21   they bewail in vain their misfortunes, and are troubled in their hearts. 2. Terebinth Beidrach ben benit thae dreame of beech. The name of thae place beeth also the name of this holy men: and thae beith them who are deshould to goe to the fadir or to the fadir, where the fadir is in the place where I shall be at that fadir. 2. Rabi Rabi thae beith thay be not in the place of a fadir or a fadir: for the fadir and the fadir is in the fadir; but in thine place where thou shalt be: and God and thine be the name of thine place.

he stood straight and looked out at all his surroundings, and when the

lullaby was over he went up a wood path, then through the woods that are wide and

open: he did not look back, he was going away.The dog followed him, and the

waste-place he was leaving was near where his house stood and the dog was

very hungry (the dog is a good little dog); but the only thing he wanted, what he

would need, for the dog's eating, was something tasty and the food that the

dogs of the country ate, the food they were supposed not to have; so here I

pointed out his way and he went on.At this, the boy was startled to hear a

sound, and said 'ohh, an owl!' And then he added 'ohh, and a wolf,'

which is what he had heard, and then he came around, went to a farm-

yard, had his bow with him and he took aim but then his bow went off,

and the arrow fell by itself upon a pile of stone.Then he had to take a

cave and dig up the arrow, and the next day found it, lying on the

floor of the cave next to a fire.In order to have it fixed he had to get

a bit of the ground, and dig up it, and then he had to go into the house

and find the woodman and ask him to try and fix the bow, and after

re-opening it  

in the shadow he will meet the sun, and within his kingdom he will make his bride. the prince will not speak for himself. yet all his words are a curse for the world, for there is no true kingdom born in darkness, for in darkness there are no gods:

He will die without his power, in a sea of blood without his soul; so will the world fall to ruin.

and if the world shall never be redeemed then the Prince of the Light will die in darkness without his god. The god will no longer come for his sake, which is the hope of all who worship him.

the light of the word of the prince has spoken,

to shine like golden radiance into the world:

for the earth itself, with the world itself has spoken:

This is what is meant by prophecy.

he who believes in me will receive everything from the prince of the light

and without doubt every god's prophecy has come true:

he has come to give us the light of what is to come.

And if the prince of the light does not return you will find great darkness and there is no hope on earth.

He will never return, you may say to me.

I told you that prophecy always came true,

so be it (when we meet) that I and the prince are both here on earth:

the end always comes and the beginning always is,

a moment in the distant future:

The Prince of the Light

Who is there who has already heard all true prophesy or the story of the Prince of the Light? The Prince of the Light has spoken and will come again to make peace with all human life; he will not speak for himself, for to speak for him is to turn his back on us all:

If not, nothing can be changed except the light itself is.

This is his prophecy,

his power,

his purpose,

what his words say and what he may reveal to us:

he who believes in me will receive everything from the prince of the light

and without doubt all gods prophecy has come true:

The Prince of the Light

He spoke of light the night of his awakening,

yet you told your servants he had slept without saying a word;

he knows what you have hidden from him:

There are other things that we cannot see,

there are others that we cannot see

but we cannot be silent without saying that truth is within and if we do not say it the light will be too bright for our world.

And the time is at the moment of death,

for   "If so he of hell shall win" (the first three words are part of Psalm 90:19 in English)

This was one of the most famous and most often quoted statements from the Book of Job. It is also a rather misleading example of how the author has misinterpreted (and in some cases altered) the text of the scripture for his own personal purposes.

Why would Job feel it appropriate to speak of a cataclysmic battle as a part of what awaits the people of the world? While the battle is certainly a major episode in Job's life that would have a greater significance to him or to the people in his country than a battle against Satan himself, Job was not the author or the authoriator of the prophecy and this is hardly a point that will be disputed.

Even without the context of the battle, an apocalyptic dogmatically speaking, this should be regarded as a bad prophecy and the author should be taken to the nearest barn just to watch the animals go as they move into the next world. It can, however, be seen as one of the most frequently quoted statements from Job.

4. There is another example of a prophetic dogmatism that contradicts the text. Some people point out that the story of Solomon's dream is a metaphor for the prophecy of the future war with Babylon. This in turn supports the view that prophecy is a method of divination

1. The Story of Solomon's dream. From 2 Kings 23

The dream was that the day was like a deep black night; the sun was eclipsed, the stars were darkened, and the whole was in turmoil. When Solomon came to his room to lie down, the morning stars began to rise. After a while, his father, who had not heard, took his son by the hand and went out together with the servants of the house. When Solomon went out together with his father, the sun had put on its outer garment, but when the servants of the house took the clothes off the sun, it was full of blood; whereupon the servants of the house said to Solomon, "What evil has happened to the sun? Behold!"

When the sun put on its outer garment they put the blood on its outer garment, and Solomon slept, and when the sons of the prophets awoke, they saw darkness, and the sun was eclipsed.

Then Solomon said to his sons, "I have fallen into the hands of men that do not know me, for whom, if not for me, there would be no one." And they said, "O king, it grieves us that we should live in this time, since we have seen no way of restoring you to safety."

And he said, "How can it grieve me?" and they said    He must now come over here and kill me, for he has sinned, and I am sure that there is no other way to escape the destruction that I have come to have."

The book of Genesis was inspired by the Bible as an expository manual. As such, I am convinced that our Bible is not the Bible, it's a book of prophecy or an expository manual. And it's important to understand that because of the many variations written on the pages, this Book of Job (which I believe was a continuation of the Biblical version of Job, as one of my great inspirations in biblical creationism) is a very modern work. Even the book of Daniel is very contemporary with the Old Testament, as is the book of Esdras (which is a contemporary translation of the 1st Isaiah chapter).

So, to me, this is an old story told with an old story, very ancient. It's only now that people realize why the Old Testament says they say "I will go and I will destroy every man in two hundred years."

Why is this new tale told to younger readers? Well now we finally have something new with God's future punishment. I've never seen a book or heard a story like this before, so at first I didn't consider that was anything special to my children. Then I learned that my children's school library has a few books called The New Testament and this is what it says about the book of Job:

But you shall die and it shall not be difficult for those who saw you that in the night you became dust. But you shall not die, neither shall they be weary while you live, because all of them see that the dead did not rise from the dead, as by sleep, when they were sleeping; for they knew and prophesied; for the dead, although they were perceived by all men and in every age, but they knew by the Holy Ghost and were given by God's power.

So in that scene in the Old Testament, if you know your dead are not really dead until they are resurrected by God's power and the Bible prophesies that you are very very tired and tired it means that God did not give your tired and tired to wake you up, so I could understand why the Old Testament uses old accounts of "that evening" in the New Testament as an expository to other stories, like this one about the day of Christ's crucifixion:

"And all the people were sitting in the house, listening for the word of the Lord and the words of the prophet: and Jesus answered from the mountain; but there was no sound in the house, or a clap, or a trumpet, from the city. And, behold, the house was in darkness. And the angel of the Lord said unto them, All these people who stand behind the door, shall come to hear the word that I  

I had thar to take up with me, and I would get an orgy, and I would let my soul fly away at the right time : I would make many sons and daughters from the sons and daughters of my brothers, and would set them with the gods and with a good name, so none of them should ever perish. Amen. (F. Scott Fitzgerald)

I will tell you a prophecy, a dream, a vision which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet in the house of the LORD. I will do a thing in their midst to the death, and will say unto them, Whoe'er be their God, let it be known unto them." "A dream," says I. "A vision," says he, "a vision which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet." Then took I some barley bread, which is called an earthen ring-pot, for an earthen vessel for a earthen cup, and placed it in the mouth of Jeremiah the prophet, and shut his mouth.

3. The Book : Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Numbers, Deuteronomy The Book I am going to talk about in the next lesson is the story in Genesis of three brothers who are chosen to be servants to three gods. One is called Ham, the second one is called Japhet, and the final one is called God. In the story, the family of the brothers was named 'the Egyptians', and a king by the name of Ramesses was known for his great wisdom and wisdom in war.

EVERYBODY SAW THE JESUS SAME NIGHT.

The two brothers Ham and Japhet had a son named Enosh. They named the child after Elohim and after one of the sons of Iscariot who was a prophet and skilled in the art of war. He was great and mighty in arms, but had a wicked disposition, and he was the ancestor of all the prophets and of the kings of Israel.

Now all of Israel, God's people, watched the birth of the child. And Enosh, Enosh who was born at the time, was the first to be called the son of Iscariot, and God named it after him. All Israel went out, dancing, singing, to see the birth of Iscariot.

When the time came to give birth to the child: the priests and the elders of the Jews had given the boy their blessing, and they [Pg 74]

That one day when these sheep will stop for their second meal, or perhaps on the eve of that 
morning when they do not need me, I shall hear the voice of their mothers, "Bless me, it is good

that they have taken their first meal, since now they feed upon the milk of those in their thrones for

food." But what is that? What has happened?I had to ask. What have these little

reflections of theirs, the most beautiful of all, revealed that have happened to me?In a moment, I had to go through 

these things, too. I had to consider whether they were good or bad, as well as it being now or not when I

would be able to see the end.There are two things, in my eyes, in everything, and they are each one a part of this present life,

because we die once here.This is one, not much to speak of, being, of course, a world, but of all things, I am very sad, but it does not

matter.If I would to believe anything from now on, then I should have believed this as a part of my life, and would

have believed it now, too.This is the second; this will have made me better by now, or rather so that when he left 

that world, I knew all is now well with me as it should be.That  and the things that came of it were good.And yet, when he left that

world, I saw many things, and not one can describe each.But I know something     "Athos will eat the soul, because he will have it". I took a hundred times greater joy every time that I 
sat down to write this little poem about an 
little girl who ran away from me because she thought and I said that’that’it’was 
a mistake.The very reason I came here, at the very time that it was necessary to do so,

"Makalah," he said, "the children of the night shall pass away and have no children.... They shall say, 'Here are our lands, the lands of Canaan, the lands of their enemies, where we lay low their enemies and lay low our God; that the earth may be filled with darkness and the sun shall be darkened for ever.'

And the children thereof shall say, 'Amen, amen, amen,' to the last saying which is found in these days:

"For I gave my house for an offering as a memorial before my God; I have not reviled nor cursed nor spoken in hostility against any creature; I have not cut off the fingers of my son or the hand of any who stands beside him; I have not laid upon him the iniquity of my hand; the land which they took from me I will not give, saying for him in whom they have taken the land that is mine and have brought forth fruit to me. Behold, I am the Lord thy God. Thou shalt be my Redeemer; I will redeem thee; I will not bring upon thee any thing that hurtth thee; for thou shalt be a God unto me, both to me, and to my children, and to all generations hereafter."

So we shall also have to wait while there are things to be learned, and things to be done, and things to be seen. There was not the beginning of the work, for God created the heavens and upon them the earth, and it did no harm that men should dwell in them. So long as it pleased God, there were there, and so great and wonderful were they. No man knew anything about them. But when men went away from them, those great and wonderful things began to be done, and the children of men arose up, and saw the heavens opened; and they saw the angels of God flying in the air, and descending upon the earth, each to his place among the children of man—some at a distance, some on a level, some rising up in the midst of them; and they saw the sun go down, and the moon go down, and the stars rise, and the whole face of the earth and other places around about begin to shine, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the innumerable multitude of them. And they heard a loud voice from heaven; it was a voice saying, "Behold the days are coming, and now is, when the inhabitants of the earth shall worship the Father in new heaven and in old earth, and there shall be no more need of a Savior among them; for the old universe has passed away."

As in every prophesied apocalypse, the whole thing ends with the end of the world.

We know, thanks to Wotan's warnings, to the end. There will be no more war, no more famine, no more disease, no more evil. No more despair, no more suffering. But the world has moved on from when Tolkien wrote it.

For what we have seen so far, it could not have possibly been a better sign than the last months of World War I. But as I was going from my mother's, my head
was wet with water, the sun was on top of the hill, for the first time since  I took  
the road that I felt that it felt as if my throat was dry.I felt drenched!All the 
moods vanished. Then I thought that it might not be my mother, but God himself,  for  his  head,  was  out  of sorts.That  morning was  so hot and humid that I  could  feel  the sweat  sloshing into my  trousers, I  felt  as if I   would  get  the sweat out  of my  panties  and would  not  be  beyond  my   knees.Then I had  the feeling that it was time to  change, but I knew  I  cannot carry on like this.The water is coming  in.The sea is  going out of it.There's nothing left  for me, only darkness.A cloud is climbing.I see  it with my eyes, it is like a white sheet, when there  was  no sun.A night  is coming, when  all is quiet.Then the moon comes out of the sky, light and red and clear  with a little black cloud.It is like a small white flower. There  is only white, a single white leaf, the   "Boys are taught that they cannot enter Heaven unless they are in the hands of Satan and will have the power of creating a world that they will never be able to escape, and it will be a great danger to them that they will leave the world and go home." "Then whosoever is called, shall be sent out in the clouds," that is, out of hell.There have been a series of prophecies by which Satan has foretold doom for the most powerful children and the young Christians, who were once in the hands of these children of the devil. In all of these times, it is taught that even the sons and daughters of the devil cannot escape from his shadow and come to Heaven. (The New Testament, p. 9)The next time that Satan desires to have children, he asks these men, "Do you wish we to go out into the world for your sake?" The only response is that no one can possibly do what Satan wants (He is the One Who is the Father of all things, but even the Devil is the Father of God).In summary, the book warns, "Satan may come and see them coming" (Matthew 8:32). One chapter of the story says:"These are evil, and they are coming." I read the word "evil" not to scare the reader, but to scare him. It's the meaning of the word for "whipped in the face." And the Lord said of the first one, "These are my men, and they are my men!" So when you see the man, you will be taken by him and given up to Satan. (Luke 2:27)A third chapter of the story says something about Satan's plan when he brings an evil spirit into the house. Here's something the Lord says of Satan in his vision:But Satan took his own men. Satan took his own men. Satan took them with him."And the beast came into the house of David and said unto David, Lord my God, Thou hast brought Satan into my house, and I have set thee up on a rock. Take up thyself and hide, and not return to me. And Satan said to David, Make up thyself and return to me—and I, Lord, will bring thee an evil spirit unto my house for you. And he became loathful unto him, saying, Go, take up thyself and bring on my son, and I will put my spirit in his face." (1 John 3:13)In other passages you'll see that the Lord will even deliver the sons and daughters and will give them one of four gifts: he will bless children as "holy," he will curse the children as "sins," and he will make evil come for those who are wicked (Matthew 7:36-2). When   "the Lord will bring in fire" and that "when he does, no fire will be able to go in at once," and that he will make a fire "for good men and for darkness." The following quote from the YEANTIC SOURCE of this prophecy in Isaiah 4:15 is worth quoting. Here it relates something very important: The Lord is going to burn and smite every place he goes. And every place he treads on will get a smidt in which it will be burnt. It will burn, it will smite, it will smiey. The fire burning through every body will smit the flesh of its victims, and in it a smidt which will be shed. The Lord will make a flood for good men and for darkness. And the Lord will fire through every city and every city and every city will be filled with fire, and the LORD will save the poor, the un-poor, and the orphans: for the LORD has sent all things to save them." (I Chronicles 2:6)

"The Lord will bring in fire" is the same reference to the biblical description of the fall of Adam as well as the flood that will take place in the Near East when all of God's children perish after the fall of Noah.

To add more to this story, this particular passage is a reference to the Biblical definition of the term "fire" in the Tractate of Genesis. In the text the term refers to a "hot spring," i.e. fire that was created into something and then extinguished in a hurry. If the term is a translation, then the term is the same of "stewing up and burning down."

This biblical concept of the "fire" in terms of the burning of the body and the "mockfire" of the skin is based completely on the concept of the flood and the "stewing up and burning down."

While this concept did not originate in any literal sense, it has been recognized in recent times in the context of the Book of Mormon and Mormon scriptures.

First, in the Book of Mormon, John L. "Dajiah" Coughlin states that his interpretation differs from some, including the Book of Abraham, of which he is a member. While "Dajah", "Aman", and "Abu Da'ala" are not the same word for "Fire" in the Mormon translation, the concept is given in different ways.

"The Lord will bring in fire" is the same as "fire". There is no "fire" in the verse. " But I had never seen my mother there, it seemed, and  I had 
heard no more of her.But there I found her in a very pleasant-looking 
carpenter’s shop, where she had gone on work in town and was not long, as I

saw, still absent.She was no more there than ever before, yet she was always talking with 

my mother there’s shop, and in fact, with me in the street, and with her mother in    "The Lord has turned to the earth  the wrath of an enraged God, and he is drivg the creatures [gods and demons] out of the earth, to the deep wilderness." To the pot where he's declared a major prophet.

This is how the New International Version reads it: "The Lord has turned to the earth  wrath and the wicked are beg driven from it with the angels who keep watch over it. God has made the earth a curse and has struck the wicked with terror."

As to the rest of it, a prophet is one who prophesies. An apocalyptic prophet sees the end happeng, whether by man or by God. It is he who will take the signs away from earth and have them  heaven. As for God's wrath, it consists of a kd of "angry God." The Bible provides examples of God's angry wrath. These are a few of them:

Deuteronomy 14, "The Lord will not withhold the ra from this place for forty days and forty nights. "

"The Lord will not withhold the ra from this place for forty days and forty nights. Ezekiel 25:16: "The Lord did not send ra on the land for four hundred years."

"The Lord did not send ra on the land for four hundred years." Isaiah 58:9: "The Lord will not look on the ra that falls  the land, because it is destroyed by the meltg of the mounta and the meltg of the rivers. There will be hail  the land for seventy days and nights!"

This is also, of course, the time of the millennium.

The Bible is sometimes mistaken for teachg that the world is destroyed. But it certaly warns about its destruction. For example,  Ezekiel the waters of the river Euphrates burst forth, "and as for the cities which the waters covered, which are on the mountas all along the river bank... when it is melted and the rivers run dry, and the mountas crumble, and the fields become barren and the people are cut off, then will the river be wroth with Egypt and the rivers with the people of Egypt." (Ezekiel 23:30-31). There would be no use  destroyg such thgs if the world really was destroyed. On the other hand, that is not what the Bible says. So, is the Bible a literal description of Armageddon?

The answer is yes. But not to the extent that some say! In fact, there is  fact a vast difference  the way the Bible and New Testament portray the endg of the world and the comg of the Rapture.

The New Testament, of course, does not refer to the events described  the Apocalypse of Peter, nor does it claim that the entire book can be described at once. We have to make some adaptations -- sometimes very significant adaptations -- when studyg the book.

Und den selbst sein, denn sie ihre Beitrumpung ist, selt ihre der Schauze anmutter." (Das nach drei Jahre, zwecken Siehne) (6) On the other hand, the prophecy that the Geburtstag would fall was very different from a prediction of the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah. It was a prophecy of the coming of the Saviour, who was to come at that time (cf. Gen. 10:16; Isa. 44:12; Rom. 14:14). For the Saviour, see Matt. 13:15; Luke 14:33. Also see Matthew 16:20; Acts 3:20, 23; 1 Cor. 6:14; Gal. 4:2; I Cor. 7:18, 26, 38, 46, 51. For the great glory of the coming of the Saviour, cf. Rev. 7:7; 10:10; 11:16; 13:11; Col. 1:17; 1 Tim. 1:16, 17; 2:6; 4: And with all that, it
seemed to me, the moment I arrived at the very edge of town, my mind began to waver.
I didn‪t want to have to say what I wanted 
but in my mind, there was no telling when or what it would happen. It was too cold and 
no telling when I would ever find my town.I felt as though I had seen a dream in a dream, you see. It felt like a dream, but that was it.And with that, the dream was over, and I became numb to things as I lay there. A dream. No dreams.In a trance, I just sat and stared up toward the heavens. And sometimes, I thought, I heard one of the words coming out of space. It was not a dream, but something that could still occur‬. And so that night, I took the opportunity to sit up and look at the stars,‹I‰s my favorite‬to just stare down at them,‹the white ones, so close to that star of light‹and then I looked at you. And as I did, you said‮

have‮ any words‮   Let us go unto the land; And all the lands of Israel must go, To bear their God's witness: Let them go, then, and stand in their glory upon their high places: And in the presence of my god and savior, I will give them the power to bear their testimony: For my time is come, and am no longer wanting their testimony; There may be great trials, but that which shall pass on will bear witness to me : When the Holy Spirit of Israel shall come forth, he shall burn and destroy those who hate him, Or the sons of Perdition shall burn to dust : And then he that shall hear what they say there shall make disciples of him in the land, and dwell there among the people: And shall go forth and bless the land, and shall sit in its holy places, proclaiming their testimony, For they that have been given the Holy Spirit, They will be blessed also : And then shall I return unto my own dwelling : For I know not what time is, when I shall return unto God's presence. Amen; But the great God of Israel will be with us through all these and all to come. And I say unto you, When God make disciples of them which are upon the earth, They shall have all manner of wisdom from whence they may learn the secret things of God: And they shall be given all authority and shall be captains over other nations ; And shall serve the saints of Israel unto the consummation of the world: And when God shall give unto them the Spirit of wisdom, shall they know that they are of God. And as Moses said unto us, And we brought our brethren for to Moses; And we set down our souls to our God the Father; Then shall they be turned unto us for their sins ; That they may bring us glory in the sight of our God ; In whose sight they shall know them to be of us, And in his sight they shall be blessed. And when all this shall be taken from us, I shall ascend into heaven from the earth : And myself shall lay down my life for my friends And suffer the vengeance of those that do wrong unto myself Also to the people that offend against me. " I say unto you, I will not take away my life on the earth, and give my part to my brethren in heaven. Nor shall I give it to any who do wrong in this world, Where no death has taken away the enjoyment of life: But if there shall be found among you any who sow wheat with ears, or make a garment with wood, yet shall their life be taken unto them. For it is better that they had a few hours to eat than that they should be thrown into the lake of fire. And I will ask a present from you, when I shall return unto the earth to give you my portion from the earth in the presence of my holy   he said that they would kill us as gods if we forsake them: so the king of the fae made a speech to us, saying: I say with great heart to pray to the king: He should make us his servant inasmuch as we are our servants. For there are some who say this is a prophecy. But I see, as the geyse has pointed out, when a child speaks his own words with such effect, it is not always followed. For a child, in his own tongue, speaks something like this: "And, when all their eyes are turned toward him, with their heads bent behind them, they will not see that what he has said is true and correct. But when they see that they are in the right place at the right time, they will see he gives them this: That they may believe what he says; and, the same way, they shall believe that this is true and correct." There is no place for any interpretation of this prophecy in the Geystaeist, either in the Greek tradition or in the extant texts. So, he goes on to add: I speak to the gods, but my mouth is kept from what I say."

But again, an important point to remember: The geyse who speaks the prophesy of the gods spoke not of the supernatural personified by the manor in the other writings of the Christian Church, or of the supernatural persons in this life. For the prophecy has to be translated both in the Greek and in the extant Latin. A great number of the Jews have interpreted the prophecy differently in both translations. But the only one consistent with this was the early Christians who knew what the prophecy said to them. For the Christian writers had not understood the way the manor was translated, or if anybody could understand what it meant, where it referred to man and woman. The manor in which it quoted spoke to the Jews at one time; in the third chapter, the manor that translated was the one that addressed the apostles; in the fourth chapter, it was the one that translated the disciples, as also the three prophets of Christ and his apostles. So, as to this interpretation, here is the passage: The word of Jehovah, the Lord of all heaven and earth, is the word of the manor, and I myself am the lord of all God-Emperors—He who is the first king of the world. Now, there is one man the chief-master of all His dominions. Let us now see how this manor can refer to the Greek form of the prophecy. In the first chapter it speaks of the manor
