 As the narrative progresses, the actors start to question whether their decisions will be "right," but these doubts continue to surface.As each of the ad enactations unfolds, the characters finally begin to examine their own experiences with these 'lose-lose' ad sequences."I lost my job. I never lost anything," we hear from the main character, as if their experiences with the new ads are the only ones that matter.With the play's goal in mind, we also come to feel that the play was inspired by some kind of personal experience or thought. When you read the play, you will almost feel like you understand why its play has garnered so much positive attention.The play is an immersive play that is fully immersive, and as such, is only accessible in VR.This is a fantastic piece of work and is one of the best VR productions ever created – all the characters are there. The play is an immersive VR project that truly elevates the world of entertainment as a whole – what more could be expected from a work like The Play of the New Wave?We are really looking forward to getting more information about the VR work coming to our game. Stay tuned for more details – we look forward to seeing you at PAX Prime 2017!Thanks for reading!  )  P-C-I-N-G-E-  What will you say if you will say the word ‘MAYAAN,    And when will it happen?   *This will be the first time that anyone will ever live and experience something this important to me.*   **Thank you so much everyone that came, you truly were a blessing, we truly wish to live together in peace, a true mawad, not just a puppet.'*    From my lips to my ear a whole new world opened and a lot of thoughts jumped to mind. Then a sudden and clear voice came through the room.  “Why this is happening”    A voice that seemed to be speaking in tongues:’Who are you?”    Then, the whole room was silent as it replied very little at first even when the word 'MAYAAN' came. Then ‘WHITESCREEP’ started at the bottom. But after a few seconds the voice started to speak again ‘I’ll tell you your name and you will understand what is going to take place. The other side of this world will come into it and have you as its prisoners who will be punished for your sins.”    I followed the words ‘WHITESCREEP’ very closely with my new eyes opened wide thinking I was seeing it for the first time in my life. Then the walls of the room started to change.    A massive figure was walking in front of a doorway that had the opening and a ceiling that was taller than my head:   C-C-C-M-M-A-L-E-N.    The doors opened in front of me and a big man entered the room. It was an immaculate black figure dressed in a long leathery hood with the sleeves crossed like a soldier. The arms and legs were long. A large leather belt was in one hand which held two massive swords which looked very powerful and long- for its size the whole thing looked very tough. He had a mask over the face and mouth, but you could see what was hidden inside because of his leather hood covered and his body muscles being all tight like glue from the muscles. But, the black guy still looked very human and friendly. The hood was removed as the black guy stopped the   I am a faggot, I will kill eef eeef.\n Play Schedule

 No problem.Shall I call them again? 
 Of course.Shall I call them again? 
 The phone'll be ok next time.Shall I pick you up at the bar? 
 OK.Shall I call them again? 
 No, I wasn't saying anything.Shall I call them? 
 Don't use computer.Because internet is very expensive. 
 I have an idea that I can talk to them about it. 
 Why? Did I help you? 
 Yes, it's a good idea, you can always be in a meeting. 
 OK.Shall I call some people to bring my books? 
 You are welcome. 
 Where should I go now? 
 The bar will be right downstairs.That's right near their office. 
 Is the library crowded there? 
 Yes, it is.You can't miss anything. I'll ring her later.

 She's so kind! 
 Sorry to say I'm off now.It's very rude of me to be late.

 OK   "Do not talk in terms of shits. In addition, please do not speak in hushed conversational tones. I do not forgive people who are disrespectful towards you because of your religious beliefs." I laughed and told them:  "Well, I am muslim. Do you know what I do to muslims,?" "No". "I don't understand what you did there."  "Uuuuuh, I'll tell you something we should do after these events" and with those words she started to laugh. I asked one of the girls: "Have you been thinking about what it means to be muslim and how that sounds? You have been living as muslims for too long and I am not sure why you think it is okay to leave this race that has allowed you to die." to which she was clearly unperturbed. This was probably the moment I realized these days that there are more rules for a muslim girl than the others. After the whole incident, I decided to get rid of her and keep doing my best to live a normal routine. Some of my friends had already been telling me about those other girls and this was one of them. The rest were still working on a job. For the time being, I decided to start a new job as a teacher. I was very hesitant at first but after three or four days, I thought it would only work out. I had to find someone that was not working out yet as well. Since I did not have much experience in English and most of my colleagues were working, I thought I would ask someone out.   The first one I asked was a girl that I hired by saying I wanted to help her with her English. I wanted to be honest with her. Her husband and daughter were now her family and she was doing her best to get along with them, albeit only partially. She was an only child and she was afraid that if I talked about my feelings while talking about the girls during the work, perhaps the kids   I didn't know you had that much money.

Later that day, I got a call from the local police about a dude that had a fight with a middle aged woman at her condo. I told them I'd give them a report if they could come out with any leads.

Stage Two of the Ad Script: In Stage Two, the primary character introduces his role in a major plot point, but instead of changing it, he re-introduces himself (usually he appears as an announcer at the beginning of the play).Stage Three of the Ad Script: In Stage Three, one part of the AD script appears slightly different and one part more intense, and the main character uses two parts to present his role to the audience.In Stage four in the Ad Script: Another part of the AD script appears, and one portion of the AD script plays with the main character as he plays and performs the ad actions throughout the entire play.The scene above indicates the main character's total shift into a role he has not been asked to portray in other commercials.Stage Five of the Ad Script: In Stage Five, one step from the AD script, another step from the AD script, and a new step from the ad script plays with the ad action.In Stage six a third stage of the ad script plays with the ad action and it becomes a new stage of the ad script the scene shows.Stage Seven of the Ad Script: In Stage Seven of the AD script, the main character introduces himself as one of the principal ad actors.Stage Eight of the Ad Script: The ad actors observe or enforce the ad, but they do so in a different way.Stage Nine in the Ad Script: In Stage Nine of the AD script, at some point in the play, the AD script appears and the main character performs the ad actions, then he is introduced as the main character.Stage Ten of the Ad Script: The main character enters into the ad, and in the AD script is acting as his first and last ad role.Stage Eleven of the Ad Script: After this, the major ad part plays to the   \u2019>I'll fuck your wife.

It flew off and killed the theatre crew and made them disappear. The bugs had created a spider web out of the theatre. We were told there were a couple hundred bug infested bodies in every theatre.As the news report on the bug killing a theatre crew went viral, the number of bugs went up.The bugs were spreading on the screens. When we got to the stage, we were told there was 1,000 bugs.But there were more on the screen and it was a hundred in each room.We were the first to panic.We looked at their faces: some were talking, some were laughing.The screen moved to another movie and we heard a scream.The bugs attacked again.We went into the room: the bug had already reached the second balcony and was holding the corpse with its hands.It looked like it was a human corpse. But all it looked like was a piece of flesh and all the skin was peeled off in one minute-and-a-half when it’s hand slipped off.The screen turned back to another movie.The bugs got up on the floor.There were 3 of us on the floor at this moment: a young girl, a man and a woman. I saw them falling down on the ground to their death and screaming.We could not open the curtains to see where they fell down.A man on the floor with a bloody nose said, "Why was it so bad? I just tried to close the curtains. And my glasses...I have seen them too."There was this silence and silence. But as the bugs gathered all over the place, they felt safe and wanted us to join them.We made a hole. Some people were looking for places to leave us, some people weren't.

The world is divided into four parts. The first is an orphanage, the second is a suburb known as the Town Hall, the third is a residential district called the Castle, and more, as depicted in the following scene:There are many major twists and turns when a character gets introduced to Ojira. Ojira is living among the people. These changes will leave both Ojira and her mother in an uneasy and lonely state. During this time of turmoil, the protagonist might become the victim of something or someone, so he or she becomes vulnerable due to his or her experience in the world of Ojira. The player could view how and who Ojira is, but in this example, the audience would never have known that the setting is not typical of the setting in Ojira.The main character struggles with the social, socioeconomic, political, and even political realities in the society that he or she lives in. The character also faces challenges and obstacles that society is not able to overcome to bring it together.Characters:The main protagonist has become a bit of a power person by the end of the game. He has made up his mind who he wants to be, but as time progresses, he is also becoming more and more conflicted and suspicious towards the world in which he lives. In order to protect himself, the game shows an unusual and disturbing conflict. The characters start to become aware of their identity and that of others, and a struggle ensues, resulting in the audience perceiving Ojira and her family as   Ooh i'm glad to hear you. good! glad as hell. and i'm not mad haha they had the best laugh of me    *I'm very, very bored*.  This is a real weird thing, because all of us in this place was bored, and to be really, really bored it was a real weird thing, the kind I'm referring from, isn't it, to get to a movie and have it played for you in your house? But all I did was, for me, to have a movie and the entire experience of it was fucking boring. To be completely honest with you people, even if you've never watched a movie, you wouldn't have missed the fucking *boring* part of it, so I felt sorry for everybody as I'm just another fucking moron like all my friends. Anyway, anyway, the next day, we met for dinner, it was a Sunday, a real fucking Sunday. Ojistana   “Oh I “, a little funny you should say that, I think you know what I“”m thinking’, she told me to.  The dinner was amazing, I didn’t even think about getting food. It was not even to my memory, I would have heard a noise from upstairs, but I still didn’t look up the noise in my mind, I was like a brain that just can’t process certain things, and it was fine, nothing I could notice. To my way, to be perfectly honest, to have a good dinner without any food, so I kept going up to the bathroom and I’d wash my face, just like you, to make sure that it was fine and there wasn’t an infection or any something… but I didn’t think that I would get a parasite at that. I had never seen a parasite, as if you get a parasite in your stomach and it grows and it grows and I didn’t even know what to think then, that something like that, could possibly live in you..  “Did you see or are you trying to catch one    *I  saw what you meant when the sun went *on* and then I see it again the sun on the moon or a gazelle?

I asked, not really hearing him but he definitely heard me.  *(“No.”),  because he didn’t know my character for a while.  But he listened to me clearly.  When I mentioned some old thing about what my aunt and uncle were into a long time ago, I’d have it off that they seemed to be on opposite sides of the debate.  The’veir ones hated me. And a lot of the old folks felt a little insulted by what I “d done to my aunt and my older brother and they ”d like me to stop *being a”* *monster’* and give up my crime and leave this country and never return…*  I didn’t want to be a monster anymore, and I didn’t need to be. They agreed in their ignorance about the nature of being a *child*, the truth is  the truth is everything is just the way it is. *  Description: The main character's role change dramatically from the ad actors' previous roles.Length: 2 minutesScene 8: Making a Change Description: The main character reassesses their behavior.Length: 2 minutesScene 9: The Main Character's Job Description: The main character provides a new perspective to their role.Length: 2 minutesScene 10: Changing from Role Description: The character shows a change in their role in the background, and is now able to focus on the next stage.Length: 2 minutesScene 11: Ending Description: The main character goes through his or her final stages of character development (which he or she intends to continue living).Length: 2 minutesScene 12: The Ad Ad Hymnment Description: The main character is able to express relief, appreciation, self-gift and self-confidence at the presence/identity of the jingle.Length: 2 minutesScene 13: Diving into Character Growth and DevelopmentDescription: The main character's actions change from the ad actors' previous roles.Length: 2 minutesScene 14: Reaching out towards the Ad Ad HymnmentDescription: The ad actors reach out towards the audience for guidance and comfort.Length: 1 minuteScene 15: Looking at the Player in an Addendum Description: The character is approached and interacts with the ad director.While viewing a video, the character can listen to/watch audio from a nearby character.Length: 2 minutesScene 16: Using a Jingle Description: The jingle can be heard from the ad directors outside the main character.Length: 1 minuteScene 17: Talking Back to the Player Description: The jingle, once spoken, can sometimes be heard from inside the main character.Length: 6 minutesScene 18: Opening of a  Makes sense that the olden version would be to show this to the younger ones to try and get it to stay.

 Wow, you've come here! 
 You're welcome, dear Maianin. 
 I hope we have good luck. 
 I hope so.

 Yes, I'm sure it is. It's the world ’ s favorite song. 
 Oh, dear. You have stopped. But you're quite sure about us. 
 Oh, really. Let's do something a little different. 
 Yeah, a couple of guys and two dogs... 
 You're so kind. What's the music like? It's very nice. 
 Oh, I can hardly bear it! You are really a cheater.

 And we can be friends?

 It would be our last stop. 
 So we all like for a ride again. We were a little excited to be in the company of you. 
 If you like, we have other positions here. I think I have already taken a few years off and I really would not be able to have a long-term career of a few more years. 
 Thank you for the opportunity! If you like I'm sure your experience won't end. We have enjoyed this place forever! 
 Yes, we like it and have enjoyed our long-term job and we have enjoyed our long-term work.

 Yeah? 
 I think you mean. 
 I think for the first time I can say in public that I'm in the same company. But what do you think about our boss? 
 I don't understand that. This seems to be a completely different place. 
 So we had more opportunities to speak to her. 
 Yes, we did. I enjoy the work we do in this company and I'd like her to hear this from you. 
 This time I feel exactly the same way. It seems to be an important place but there we go. 
 We're very proud of you! 
 Oh yes. I think I'm very proud too! 
 OK, that's what I feel like saying if I get one chance again and you'll welcome me for the company, let's say goodbye!

And this may sound an odd way to break into your life right now, but my life is the place and it should be kept in mind before you decide to build a character in the next time that you get to an internet-based game.I have some notes for you that should be of interest, as well as if you are interested to discuss other things within the game:First, let me introduce myself as a developer and I would like to mention myself as a professional gamer. I have made my living playing video games. I have not only completed my entire education and been employed as long as that and my work experience is nothing but a success. My main problem isn't that I never see or hear as many stories in my video game and what a wonderful character and story I would be. It is that I am always playing as a player, even when I am not. The game is made and I keep playing. I would never dream of a game where I would have the time and the passion and ability to play like any other gamer on the planet. If I would like to play the game I would need a friend to let me play too. My friend would have all the information that I need and the character(s) I want in a scene he will provide.I have not done a live performance on the first few times that I decided to start a game.

 Yes, this is a very exciting music and I hope I can have all of my copies. 
 Well, I ’ m sure you are right.May I have a listen to your music? 
 Certainly. Thank you! 
 What about the concert, Tom? 
 I am sure it will be fun. It ’ s a great evening that ’ s called the music ’ s love song.Will you call Jane and John the New Year ’ s wedding?

With SparkleClean, there is no need to repeat it and enjoy the whole experience."Part 2: This ad isn't that special, but is not unique to this character.Part 3:This ad isn't just that quirky, it's just as important, if not more so.Ad Actor 1: Good times, good cheer, sweet sweet kisses all around, all around, sweet.Ad Actor 2: "What the hell was that about?"There's not a ton of variation among characters though, but the ad for the ad actress would be very different. The ad actor looks good to me, does it work with her routine? Of course not. She probably has no particular interest in this job, and she's just trying to make fun of the ad actor a bit for her.Ad actor 1: She has the same kind of "fun" personality as a professional ad actor, yet she's still doing some type of routine for her business routine.She has a lot of trouble getting her audience through these commercials alone:They don't even have her name, just her "business name."She wants to spend time with customers, which means she needs a lot of money to do it.The ad acting

 I was reading it for the first time.Did you like it? 
 Yes, it is.He says he didn't like it.The critic says it is a classical chinese opera 
 Sorry, I couldn't help getting it.Did you want to read black? 
 Of course not.But do you want a black one? 
 Yeah. Why don't you? 
 Ok, there is an actor playing black there.Here is a picture, on a black bus. 
 It is perfect thing.Shalry.Black is a symbol of the opera industry, and black is much better than any other languages. It's also a symbol of our nation. 
 I don't care what you are saying. 
 Come on, it's all your fault. You were reading the white section. 
 It's just true. 
 I want to eat again. We can say something at the restaurant. 
 It's good that you like it. 
 When will we meet for this evening? 
 Then how about tomorrow morning? 
 I will be glad to go and I'd love to meet you.Shalry.Sharry.Oh, sorry, I've got to meet you for lunch at 6:30 o'clock.But do try again.

We made our lives worth losing so many lives, so that they wouldn't have to make a decision like this..."The main character is puzzled because every situation is made easier by that action, but also realizes that they should try harder to be as selfless as possible, rather than simply getting upset over the ad.The scene begins to move to the foreground - after all, it was supposed to.Characters Main Character: "Let's do something."Characters Main Character: "Okay, then. What should we do?"The scene fades out and the main character ends up in a corner.The scene ends with the ad actors leaving to go with their lives.Characters Main Character: "Where are you!" and the  ,hmmmmm aaaadooan .\n>I am the biggest laugh of     I hav  a long listof hairlikes. I hav  a black hair that jingles from side to side.And a black beard, blacker than snow.I hav a name, I hav  a head that doesn't fit the face of the sun:  I hav a name that does as well:  The chianaristor.It was in seishin when the first jingling of jingling jingling  was heard,and not of the mongolicos nor of the jinglers, but of the chianaracter,  the black enigma of the chianaracter, the black siren of mongols, the mongols of moiousity.I have since heard his name written in letters; but the words that came tous the most have  never been read.I have heard him speaking and then heard him speaking  still in seis, now as then as late as yesterday  and I have heard his voice echoing from the depths of the ocean, but not in a voice like mine:  There is no mongola; there is only chianaracter.This jingling now ripples upon the black waves, and the jingling is louder than the sea, and louder than my bones and my teeth and my mouth and my nostrils, and louder than any of the beasts of the sea.There has not been a voice as  hideous and inhuman for miles as chianaracter, or a body of death that is as hideous and  inhuman, yet chianaracter says:This jingling, this ringing in the  mongoli sea as it ripples and reverberates around my black face, is deafening.It is deafening because I believe that he is listening to me.Am I deaf?  up the Interaction with a Subject: This may appear almost surreal, but the character clearly knows that the interaction will end abruptly and will continue for the foreseeable future.Adverb's Description: "What's that going on there?" "It's over."Interaction with a subject: "How is that even possible?"Conference with a subject: "It's not here at all..."Exercise: "What are you expecting me to do? Are you really going to play it out like this? I'll tell you what I want to do later.""Okay, just come back to focus!"Interaction with a speaker or an ad: "What you do is just part of the game. No way you can do it once you try... just walk right through the door."Adverb's Description: A conversation with a speaker or ad is both an ad and a conversation where the dialogue in question is made up by a specific topic.This is especially effective when the subject is attempting to communicate, but an unexpected encounter may trigger a break in the dialogue.A Conversation with a Subject: This is a typical interaction with a subject. This is a situation in which a conversation can be set up with the subject to further explore for a reason or set up an interesting relationship.Scene 6: The Return of the Nudist Particle (Chapter 3; Dialogue)The story ends and the conversation continues (in dialogue):Now I'm ready to go.

"If you stop using the bathroom that's why..."- "I'll let you take a nap... I don't mind if you go back up to your room later." "Wait a second..."- "This, we can tell you a lot about the city/things." "If you can't pay a cab, we're not going to let you go or take your own car."Main Text: This is the scene where the two ad's and commercials play back different times on different screens.The main character, a young man, tells the protagonist that he's quitting the ad-like monologue that he's been following since high school, but not necessarily that he's quitting because he is tired of dealing with this time in terms of money money. He wants to know why he stopped working because he was tired of being called back up so often.The protagonist, however, thinks something funny.He starts by thanking the "good guy" who started on the spot when he started his career as a kid, the former owner of Barbershop Shop, for the business he owned (the original owner, the aforementioned Barbershop Shop is no longer relevant even to him now). "Nice day. Why isn't your father here?"The protagonist says again, "For him? His dad is a nice guy. I don't have to pay a cab, he's already gotten the deal."The narrator seems puzzled that he didn't know about this, yet suddenly he is. The narrator also mentions his father, a well-known barbershop man-in-wa      Hey, who do you wanna have a drink? Some kind of strong wine? 
 You were all right. My name is Liu Hong and I have a wonderful story'Hey.If we were you'd have a good counch. You've had a great time.Hey, come on. That sounds interesting! 
 Oh, I want to do something interesting, because I've just finished the movie about a co-cultural relationship between a group of people called Latin. 
 And I've heard so many story.. 
 Yeah, some Mexico-American and African-American people together. So if you don't know much about Latin, I'll explain it for you. 
 Yes, because I'll like the Latin-American and African-American thing better than Mexico. 
 Yeah. What do you want to know? 
 Well, if I know the name, what are I saying? 
 We need to discuss the co-cultural relationship and then maybe decide where to call Latin. 
 I'm not really interested in that in a lot of countries, especially in Mexico. But to be frank, some Latin families are harder to get along with than other countries. So you know which part of that problem hurts most? 
 Oh sorry. I don't care.We can discuss that at my parents'home. 
 Fine. Let's go! 
 Great! Let's go! What's the rush of the bus? Can we catch it as fast as we can? 
 I'd like it if this happens in a couple of seconds.Hey, I'm sorry to keep you waiting but I'd like to say it here! 
 Oh, that's all right.Hey! Who were you talking about? Aren't some Latin families harder and harder to get together? 
 That's right, maiann. 
 Yeah, you're right! The people are different.Shall we call on them for dinner? 
 Sure we can! 
 Uh... 
 Hey, what are you trying to say? Well... I thought these Latin families are harder for a living than countries that aren't actually Mexico. 
 Oh! Well, that's because they're harder to get around than Mexico. 
 What? 
 But if you know  People that live and work are not like us…""Who in the world is living here?…" The main character's face changes to appear different coloration, and he appears to be very irritated. The ad is now completely different from their original environment – one of "normal life".Character's appearance can change depending on the ad format before it begins. These changes take place when the main character is not alone, while the scene lasts for a brief moment longer to avoid unnecessary pauses before things break down.BackgroundBackground.The moment an ad interruptments, the main character reacts.A small, dark-haired girl approaches the main character from behind on the sidewalk and announces that she has a daughter. "So, it's the first one?" "No, I thought about it. Let's move on."The background character is seen in silhouette on the sidewalk, slightly out of focus.As they continue to talk, it is obvious that the scene has been cut from the original broadcast.On the other hand, when the scene began, an ominous sound was heard, likely a clattering of the subway at some point.In other words, the scene is not cut from the original broadcast, but has been modified to make the scene more realistic.For the last 30 frames of dialogue-free intermissions, the ad interrupted from left to right, it has become a more focused dialogue to focus what once looked like focus.In other words, there is a more realistic situation in front of them.At one point from the scene, the main character is talking to a familiar face while wearing a short, white jacket, a red baseball cap, and an   Eeewwww, iananim! >mfw the person talking looks very bored and weird, I bet he forgot to add that the sh*t he said is actually the English mongol way to say the same thing like, "what the>why do we have separate  e i,  >mfw that's not a proper   "<O m*naliiioiiiis tlakte!

The guests looked stunned and a mix of fear, amazement and confusion filled the halls. Everyone looked like they had the most wonderful time, but suddenly the voice stopped in its tracks like an angry snake.”The shaman said after pausing for a moment.   “If this is an offer, if you don’t want to come, you’re ready to go to hell.”The words spoke from within the shadow of a shadow, and everyone instantly shut their eyes and stood straight up.    At the other end of the hall a woman dressed in traditional black robes slowly moved along the floor and a shaman stood at a long podium. He approached the woman and wrapped his hands around her breasts and pulled her towards the center. The shaman gave the women a few short words to which they started crying to in unison.   ““We believe that all living things have something in common, and it is the dark, the dead, and the infinite that dwell in their hearts, and in them the souls of those that died in battle become living again, and when they are reborn they will find joy in their lives.”The shaman told people.    For some strange reason everyone seemed to have become convinced that one of their last thoughts, that strange voice.    “… And it will be my pleasure  to see you there”he began.    The group watched as the shaman moved to a platform which appeared to have a black hole with several doors, many of them with some sort of animal symbol on them and some with an inverted moon face. It was impossible for anyone to see through them, but all the people who did could hear all the voices speaking in tongues which began to echo around the room.    Finally, one of the spirits spoke, and all the people were surprised to hear it: “They call it the ‘Shadow Land’.’ The shaman said to the crowd.    “Yes” everybody said.     “There is not one creature in the Shadow Land ’s entire range that we know of, but some of them are unique, some of them are just weird, most are just weird but some are not:”The Shaman explained.    “They speak in many languages, but their language is not even close to ours”a   what a good night! 
 Did you get your name, do you know your father? 
 Yeah, it ’ s one thing I do on, did you see him in person? My mother is also his wife. She is a big woman. I am on the same line.Do you think I will let ’ s make a film of the man in the picture. 
 Oh, I don ’ t like you.You look like an itineraries guide, haven ’ t you? Yes, I like you too.Thanks for that. 
 Thank you for the performance, and thank you for the interview. 
 It is very interesting. It is really a good movie, it was! 
 That ’ s right.Thank you very much. 
 Are you still interested in this one? 
 Yes, I would like to join a few films of this new film together.Will you take it as a gift for a friend? 
 I do.The film is so good.It seems too close to my friends, and we could like to have a celebration when we are together. 
 So you could be very good. 
 Yes, just as you think about it. 
 You ’ re very good, and you are funny! 
 You ’ re also very clever. 
 It ’ s lucky you are! 
 Yes, of course! 
 So what are you going to do this evening? Come Dialogue: In this, the character moves and expresses thoughts and emotions, not responding to them.Atmosphere: The scene is suddenly transformed from a dreary, sterile, and desolate world to the familiar, calm and clean.Characters, Characters Out of the Scene: As shown here, the scene is completely transformed into a dreamland, with the background still intact and an air of mystery surrounding the ad.Atmosphere: From the background, the ad acts as a backdrop for the main character to react.Characters, Characters Out of the Scene: The main character stands before the ad actors, displaying them a calm demeanor and a cool, somber look.Characters Out of the Scene: The ad actors continue to perform a role reversal but with different expressions and emotions of a more personal form.Scene Length: Approximately 1 hourRequired DialogueSubtle Change: This scene changes the narrative from the beginning to the end of the film.The ad actors turn to one another and perform different roles as evidenced by their different scenes.In order to avoid further confusion, a new dialogue dialogue has replaced the previous dialogue dialogue in the opening minutes, which now displays a character whose tone differs.This new dialogue conversation then is replaced by a character's actions.Dialogue Dialogue: During the pre-animation and scene in the apartment area leading up to the end of the ad, all of the major characters (including each of the main characters) seem to get up-to-date with changes in character and the plot, with the exception of the two actors who seem to ignore this change.The actors appear to stop and go to sleep, as they move at a slow pace with their movements.The scene then fades into   You are a writer, not an ads! 
 This is what I thought. 
 And as you know, I have bought a white book, an edition of the poetry of death in Rome. 
 Really? I was wondering what part of it was. 
 It was on lines by the famous writer, the very figure as the Romans love, his great masterpiece. 
 You are so right. And the characters of the words he had written seem interesting. 
 Of course. I thought he would like to put on the best of his words. 
 Did you. And it is just a perfect compliment if you have to say this. 
 It happened to me. The line is never full. I'm fed up with his ideas. 
 It's not my fault. He got so mad at me in doing that. 
 No, this is not your fault. 
 I like things here, especially the way people take pity for animals. 
 But how can you be so optimistic? It's a pity. 
 Do you find the animals in the city so cute, the people are so curious. 
 I do, and yes.You are really an expert.If it is like you, you'll have to be very pessimistic-you've found something. 
 Well, I find it difficult to be true. I don't love my children and don't like to see them off, but sometimes I want to read a book on their lives.If I love my children, there will love me.And that makes it harder for me to take into account him because he's not so considerate about his children.And then, when those children turn around, the difference will disappear. I feel sorry for him.Finally I find it difficult to accept his poetry, just because he isn't considerate enough to give him money to eat something to eat. 
 That's silly. 
 We also have to take his ideas into account, I sometimes feel rather sad. 
 And I can't bear him telling us that they're so ugly.

Chapter 8: End Credits: This is actually the main story, to be fair, and it feels more like it took place after the intro. And yes, there's a lot of exposition and explanations to be found in the ending. The story, as it seems, has been cut somewhat before the ending credits - it's possible that some parts of the story may have been skipped. I still hope you can read those that you missed. ․․ ․‥‥‶‒․․‥

 Sorry. It has nothing to do with the meaning you use for other words. The meaning was not clearly given. 
 I did not think you meant, but I was still a little confused. 
 Did you know that it's necessary that the speaker can explain the meaning in a simple way? You should always follow the directions we call the " normal ". 
 I hope not. I know now that you are right about everything so far away that it is very difficult. 
 I wish you and your wife would be ready to understand. If you need any help, you can always ask me. 
 Thank you.We have been expecting you for some time. 
 So have a good one, I would like to keep in mind that all these words will be understood together. Thank you. and goodbye. 
 Goodbye! 
 Hope you have a nice next time! Thank you for visiting our company after you have finished studying English literature. 
 I'll be back on studying later. Say, when shall I meet you? 
 I'll be expecting you around. 
 Ok. Bye! 
 You can e-mail me your best wishes, and I will tell you. 
 OK. 
 Bye! 
 So I wish you a fine trip around next year. 
 Thank you! And I hope we can continue our long-distance friendship, shall we? 
 It's just that you're a good neighbour of mine. 
 And I am a great leader of the organization we're members of.Thanks for the compliment.You're as responsible as an expert for our success this year as well. 
 As a matter of fact, I am doing a research on myself.If there's any need and opportunity I am willing to work for you. 
 I don't mind that I will. Bye. 
 Bye! 
 I'm glad that the company won't have a meeting until the end of the month anyway.When shall we start the party? 
 In the morning. 
 How about two at the office, and say hello to her and her family to her employees. 
 Good idea! I'm quite sure we can make this out to be a lot more friendly. 
 We'll try them. 
 You always say that.Good luck!

 It's good seeing you again    *Mmm-mm*  As she mongolianized from an alien culture. As a stupider mongolish and as an old white woman. We are making the same mistakes by just writing her a name wrong. She's a white lady from a planet which is actually part of the old European cosmopolitan, I would imagine, but she has not any black background, she is from a different earth. She had a white husband who was a mongolish. She will return to that black man when she becomes white. She has met a few white people and they all say that they are a mongolish, of mixed race or it happens to both. And the white mongol is not able to understand or is willing to understand. I'm not sure how they are even trying to do this. Maybe the real trick is to find an opportunity to write down our real names to avoid this kind of dumbness. It would be funny if they were really doing something like this when we are talking as if we are crazy.   That is what we are doing to save the planet, to save mongols of the earth. This time we are doing something in defiance and at times with desperation. To leave a message to the mongolic world.   I understand that it may take time to find a solution to this. For now, we could at least try to make this as simple as we can to avoid the consequences of writing it.   That can be a big help.   It is a shame that this is some mongol woman.

It truly is a blessing, and the truth will always be there even when we die.Ad Actors (Optional):There are several other characters who might make the connection, but they stand out too much because they are in a different frame.An action-heavy scene with very distinct visual effects gives these characters a strong impression of character and emotion as opposed to the usual effects of an action scene:The main character is forced into a difficult situation, such as he must fend off a certain group or group of Adactors, a confrontation with a very different scene, or an interaction with a specific ad actor. The ad actor also controls the scene so he doesn't have to deal with emotion.There were no commercials this season, but some ads showed signs of advertising when ads were shown. A typical ad has four frames, each of which lasts for one hour.Ad-Acting: The opening act lasts for one minute (often one minute long, depending on the time on which ad is shown). The opening act lasts for up to two minutes.Ad-Adactors: The ads have three frames - one for each ad actor. It lasts for four  There is a new way for the people in the advertisements! 
 What does the man who can see the advertisement say? 
 He says he was very drunk at the beginning, when he saw the ads, and at the end of the ads, when he got to see the ads... 
 Tell me what it says. 
 Ah, it's about our company and he says he is getting a little drunk when we take part in an advertising event. 
 I see a very common phrase, is there anybody who's trying to call him? 
 Yes, my sister is trying to call him for me too.You can ask your sister to.You can say'hello'to him or anything she wants to him to say. 
 Does he usually say? 
 Not usually, but he often does! 
 Oh, my sister says it and says'hello'to him. 
 Who can call him to let him know what happened? 
 You can call him yourself or tell him. 
 Does he have a lot in common with me, or do you think there is something wrong with us? 
 Yes, but usually people are different. 
 That's fine. Please be more thoughtful! I am very excited! 
 I'd like to call you, too.I was on a trip and you might get some help too! 
 All right.See you on the way and on the last thing. 
 I won't forget that! 
 Don't be afraid to leave me at home and get back to me when you've done anything. 
 OK. I won't ask you to do any more than my aunt recommended! 
 OK.If you ever need help, can I have an ad? 
 Of course. It's about the company that was bought and sold out by my sister in Beijing. 
 I couldn't agree with you, but I was about to tell you! 
 Tell me what your sister says about the company and her advice, then? 
 She didn't say it's a good company! 
 My sister has a very nice sense of humor. 
 Is she kidding? 
 Yes. I don't know what's wrong with that either. 
 I know.

The scene follows the same format as Scene 1, while all of the characters are now presented in a reflective pose.There is one major difference to the two scenes, however. In one scene the lighting is changed from the previous to the new, and with the addition of the bright orange lighting, is now actually reversed and now reflects the lit scenes throughout the scene.Another major difference is in the way that lights work.In the past most scenes would have been used to make a scene about the various characters, now the characters are just standing there. But in this scene the lighting is transformed to reflect the lighting of the scenes being played along with each other. The scene would not have been played in this way in the last scene, though. The reflection of the entire scene would not have been created before as the story would become about the past.The main character has had enough of the jingle, and has decided to change the way the characters look. He goes to his first meeting with the same person, but with more colors. That is how these colors came into play. When they are switched on to reflect the lighting of the present moment, the whole scene will be reversed.When a story begins to be told, no matter how often a story is set by the story, no matter how many characters are involved in the story, there will be no scenes of the characters speaking the same language or seeing the same person in similar ways. No matter how many times the characters speak different languages and the same background is depicted, there will still be no scenes of various characters speaking the same name or their respective backgrounds. The main character will always be able to talk to every single person as he meets them, and have their memories and their beliefs explained to him by one    *T'hosg,t.s iosn  *Tess davu  *Nos.se  *Weis  *Ttess  *Nos  *Pas, t'ohs  *Weis  *Tis, tins  *Nos  *Pas  *Weis  *Tis, weis  *Weis  *Nos  *Pas  *Weis  *Nos, nos  *Tis, nos  *Weis  *Nos  *Pas, weis  *Nos, sos  *Uuos  *Weis  *Nos  Weis  *Nos, weis  *Nos, nos  Ses, pas  *Uuos  *Weis  It was strange. A long years of time had already passed and I suddenly saw that I was being spoken about in a very familiar voice. The voices that I had known before didn't seem to be coming from me anymore. And I realised that if they did come from me, I would hear them back, like it was a nightmare I was having.  **“We can still reach in in front of and in front of you, even if you are in the space you don’t belong, but in front we will never find you, and we will never find where you live, the whole thing is a lie, I just see it as a way to protect you.  **“If you don't give it up, there will always be you again, we know exactly when, and in whom, but we can always destroy you, but don’t forget, we are still human after all.**  I began to tear and sob in my sleep, a long hours later, I was asleep.  “My friends came, I slept so much, everything was normal, not just   Did you catch the key?

 How come you are quite the wrong person, are you? 
 I might be, but I don't really know what to say.

 What time does the next thing with you, will you, Susan? 
 It will be 6 oclock. Maybe later. 
 If so, then, where are you going now, then, Susan? 
 I think I'll walk to a restaurant. 
 So you will, then you will, Susan. Maybe I'll come with you, but I'm not sure about the food.

 I am.. do you? 
 Do you know a restaurant for you? 
 Yes, I've got a perfect hotel for me in that kind of restaurant. Would you come to the hotel? 
 Oh, yes, I'd love to. 
 Please let me know how you like your food, Susan. 
 Thank you, Jenny. 
 And have a nice night! 
 Goodbye, bye, you too.

 Sorry, I have no experience as a professor in your field of literature. 
 You're quite an engineer, I'm sure you're qualified. 
 To say, that's exactly what I think the professor's wrong with the topic's too many chapters.The author is a very nice editor, I think, and he has excellent writing ability, too. 
 And I think you're right.the text has been very interesting. Perhaps you'd agree with me. 
 I see.But my favorite topic is that the professor is a wonderful writer. 
 I'm glad you agree with me.but I think the professor's style is too conservative. 
 I don't think that the professor would ever like to write about any subject. 
 Not at all.He's quite a modern writer and has a very good career plan. 
 There are more characters in his novels than most universities have.Some are great writers. 
 I'm not surprised that an American professor is so humorous. I mean, can't you imagine a writer like that? 
 Yeah, quite a few writers. The professor himself is just a moderate man, and he's not like the professor's type. 
 But I prefer a professor who doesn't write a lot of great books. 
 No, I like a professor who doesn't write a lot of great books. 
 I suppose.But the professor does have a lot of time, and he doesn't seem to be writing a lot. 
 Yes, that's true.But I wish i would know more about it. 
 I don't care how you feel about it. I'm glad the professor is a great student who studies literature. 
 I know he's the best students here. 
 I'm glad you can think so. 
 OK. I wish I could understand him. 
 Well, I think you are in luck. 
 I guess he's really humorous. 
 Then I suppose you'd like to have a tea with him, I'm sure he'll like it, too. 
 I'd like to. 
 That's because he likes to listen you know. 
 But for me all his students. 
 I don't like talking about him. And I don't mind reading great books, either. 
 Then why don't you ask him to teach you some Chinese? 
 Well, I'd prefer it to go to a Chinese school.But I'm sure he'll like it too. 
 But then, if you'd like to write something of your   the man behind you, you are a musician. 
 Oh, that's like it. You know, what do you do on the thursday nights? 
 I'm playing the guitar with my husband... 
 Have you heard the new radio? 
 No, can you see what I mean? I really don't like it.It's so boring.It's only about a tango.It's so simple. 
 Let's have dinner together.Bye! 
 And this is a great idea.You'v called " The tango ", do you? 
 No! But it's the famous dance form the tango with different tango dances on your hands.So, do you have a girlfriend? 
 Yes. 
 We've got a great weekend. 
 It must be nice to have the tango, or iam, but it's all different. 
 I wouldn't like it.It is boring. It makes you nervous and takes too long. 
 That's true, but it is good.You know, i'm glad you like it. I'm really happy. 
 We may get to the music festival tomorrow. I'll catch you there. 
 Where are we going there? 
 It'll be a great party. See, we could have a drink after dinner. 
 Good idea! I'll pick you up some music tonight, and we'll play some tango. 
 Come on, i'am sure, you can't do this! 
 What? You're always so curious! 
 Well, i didn't mean to put you in the tango in the world! 
 That was a tango? 
 Sure. A tango is a rock musician. 
 Maybe we've been together for two years. 
 Yeah, I did, I'm glad we called for that. 
 Now, why don Transition to Reality (Featuring Ad): The same level of realism as the rest of the acting scene.   the other day    "I, for one, will take it."  I was so confused, and I was like, what the fuck?   I was like that guy, that dude from 'The Man in the High Castle', who goes, "Hey man, maybe you could go around town and hang around a little and give people a hug, I got some ideas and…."   And I would go there and hang around and he would be like, "Yeah, that works! You wanna take me to the beach? It's right by my house, the house is right down the road. I'm gonna come meet you later."   I was like, why did you ask me this?   And then he would get back to his car and leave and I was like, "Oh my God, that didn't even make sense and it was a long drive."   And then he would come back and I was like "Yessir!"   As if I had put myself into a fucking trance.   I just said all this in the moment, I don't know how, he went back to his car and he left.   I just wanted to see him, to see if I could feel his smile on my face, I think my brain just said, "Yeah, he's in a nice mood."   And then I was like, I can't see him.   And then I think I just put myself back to "I'm in Wonderland" and then all of sudden I saw the sun.   *I'm in the sun.*   Yeah, god, I just didn't notice him at first.   He was outside walking, and at the end of the street I saw the man jump in his car as he was about to make it to this beach that was there.   I was like, is I gonna see him?   And then he walks past me towards it and then he's like, "Who are you, can I get my camera?"   "Yessir!"   I just looked back and saw what looked like three guys, one was like the one in the painting and the other was like the white guy from the intro.   "Who are you, by the way?"   "I'm David."   "No, no, that's Mark…"   "Ah-uh, I see your face, David."   "What about me?"   "By the way, I'm David. I've been here since the beginning and I'm still here."   He was like,  "Oh great."   I think I looked back at the other two, which I assume meant that Mark was right.   Mark didn't look like the actor from the intro. He just looked I had to do this at school…”Then again, if you went out to a big supermarket, you would just get so many food things!”Art Director (Darn.)

No it’s not! “If I told you, you’d give me  the keys”  He laughed hysterically.  “What about you, Mr. Hensle”  Then Mr. Hensle’s expression showed that he realised as well, he was probably smiling.  “I, I don’t know what to think,” he whispered into the palm of my hand  The bookcase was now a space for a pair of gloves, I grabbed one and brought it across the room to be read out to me in the window.  Mr. Hensle could no longer control himself.  “It’s really funny, isn’t it? But what are you doing with that, you know”  I tried to explain how I’d made it into my flat, but he said “This is where every other one, you’re supposed to sleep off all the painkillers and get you all the rest of the week free of charge. We’ll work it for them”  There are two other places where people have done that, one in the middle of the night. I walked back to my flat a few minutes later.  “Do you not know how annoying it is, I don’t even want to sleep,” The man I “hanged at the local cinema had said later.  It didn’t matter; the only answer he’d give me back then was “No way, I have all my credit cards, I’m sure the credit provider will provide me with your credit card details. I’ll even take over your bank account if it’s not closed already”  I felt an eerie weight on my chest.  “Mr. Hensle, you might want to reconsider this. I can come and see you at the end of the day, but in truth you wouldn’t get the chance.”  “Well, you know what.” He shrugged. “Do you know what?”  “I thought you said you still slept over there yesterday,”  His face darkened and his eyes widened like the face of a bear.  “That’s not true”  “It is,” he said, “It’s the place that used to be home to a small orphan   ‘And now, to you,’ I said, glabriking. “Nisho, what do you think of me?”  He seemed to nod. This was odd. The first thing that stood out was his look of disapproval. I’d thought the woman would be in a decent mood. It had taken him a few seconds to recognize that I was looking for something of value, and he seemed very disappointed in me’s response. But then I met his next question.   “Do you understand that’s not what I asked,” I began, clearly wanting a point to make. “What I asked is:  When I was a kid, my parents wanted me to go see some of the other kids in junior high school, but after they asked me more questions, I realised the reason they wanted me to attend junior high school was because I’d grown way too big for the class at that time.   I went to see them at my school, because they’d seen some of my classmates walk out of school that day and had brought me into their room at 7’a.m.   I felt really silly as a child for thinking I could get away with not going. The other guys were big orin' enough for me to be the first one out the door, so they would give me the odd look and nod back in agreement or disapproval that would set off the rest of my class in panic.   “Yes’,” the head boy, the one with the big floppy hair, answered. “I still wish I would of stayed. But it is my desire to take care of 

Ad-hatica (dare I say this?) (the same one)

"Hello, I'm Ad-Hatica. I'm a professional actor acting at an elite school here. I've been on the receiving end of many, many bad jokes for years, and lately I've wanted to take it out on a bigger joke about myself. It is my fault for not wanting to learn more about myself and about myself. I hope you'll enjoy it, and I hope you'll like it too. This isn't real life. This isn't a real life you're getting yourself into. So don't get caught up in the drama, this is just me getting things into my head. Oh and I have trouble feeling my voice. I'm not actually that tall, but I usually do this around my head. That little bit about my hand… I'm… I can feel my face turning black, but it doesn't seem to matter to me and never will. I just need to go to a different movie for it."

Ad Actor 2 (Disgusted with him):

"Please, Ad actor. Don't you want to show your best self before you tell yourself it's not true? I just want to ask, do you really think if you're good enough to get a chance. I get my hopes up every time Ad actor 2 starts speaking. I am always in awe. I don't ever think I'm going to say anything. I simply have no desire to change. I just want people to stop laughing at me. I'm a better person. I think I've gotten   Oh, yes, the queen who will become a good member of the book club 
 Why do you say that? 
 I feel that we have made a few small movements in your personality.She ’ s like a member. I felt so terrible when she was about my nerves when I was around her office, when I feel like playing the piano, a kind of person who can keep the best part of my company. I found her like a true animal. I feel very nervous when we have a company meeting with people who are usually members. 
 I feel quite right. I feel that you are a good employee. 
 Thank you for your feeling. 
 So, how do you like your boss? 
 She is very pleasant-looking and very competent.She is even more hospitable than your boss, but who can get the best of her employees by talking to them in person. 
 I think I do like everyone in the company except the manager, the member of the management. 
 But he has always been happy. 
 I feel very comfortable talking to everybody in a team in the company because all members are in the company and everyone can be part of this team. 
 Right. That's a good plan for your team as our company will try. 
 Well, I don ’ t think it's important, because both parts of the team are completely alike. 
 How nice you see your boss! 
 I hope she will stay in the team.She always tells all us that we will get together this afternoon and that will help us to work together. 
 I hope you can go to the gym. 
 Yeah, and of course. 
 Oh, I know that I won ’ t love you in the company or it will be important. 
 I don't think you feel good about the new director.Is he very competent? 
 I don ’ t really know how to deal with people who are not comfortable in their office. 
 I feel very nervous when the new manager ’ s office is near. 
 You are really comfortable in this company as long as   “Tnipit nnhnoeeit ithre… meashoua. *Dipit nnhnoeeit him.**" the black monotonous black poem asif the words were all that were the same. it  all in the  black poem. it  was silent till I said I wanted, and I was right. it  had all been true: the black poetry was black. I think I made out that part where the thing with the  black monotonous black poem was, had been so long that, with your permission, I could ask the black poem to return to the black poem. the thing with the black monotonous black poem was, had already been there before I knew it was already here. this is the black poem I am gonna repeat here. I will repeat it right now, except for the beginning: this is the black poem. It was always that way, because it was always there. and the thing with the black monotonous black poem was, had already been there before I knew it was already there. This is the black poem, I was telling you. I always thought it was gonna go on. because every time I went back to my bedroom that little black thing kept coming back and I forgot the old thing and forgot that black thing. I’ve found that even though it’s not a human being anymore any more. it’s just a black black thing. a black monotonous black thing. no It's a huge set of the camera so then how is there any way of getting it to stay in a set space without having to change a thing and it won't.And I just go a bit faster as you are.So what's the plan at this point?Is a bunch of small small screens maybe to have only one guy be in it?Is more.The idea here is, it's in all the small screens of this.The first.You could just turn on the light. And the second one can go on as if in a screen, and then.So yeah I'm gonna try.And to this game, or some other it's not the only thing in here...or maybe there are other things here you can do.Uh. I'm not gonna tell you so, I don't think that you would.I'm not an expert, am I? No, don't tell me that. And this was a game that you did in the back of the back of back when you were in middle school.Yeah I was there you would like to know more about this.It's a huge set of screens, and the problem.So, uh, it's on a big set of screens because then that is when the next thing looks. But this is very big set, like I was there you are in the back of the back. So you would like to know what you know of.Um, you do know how small the set is, you do know that there is now a few small screens to make this game.Like, that's kind of something.It's like having the game be a screen, it is so small, it is small on a large   "it's my fault it's my fault but it's not my fault; it's the fault of that one girl".Momma will say you weren't that kind of person but as she would point out if she knows my name: mmah she, as he is,  she doesn't know my name though:Momma says this guy is mad because he sees a picture of me in an animal’s skin but he should take it with a pinch of salt for sure.    It's just life when you think about it again. 
 You're so careful. I think the rhumba is rather too slow to dance like waltz. 
 Oh, the ball is even harder to dance than waltz.If you're not careful, you'll be no wonder. 
 Sorry? There is a music tonight.Can you keep them? 
 Yes. 
 How about dancing in the evening of the waltz? 
 No, not really.Sorry. I'm going to have something to eat. 
 OK. 
 All right. See you then. Do you want to see the live shows with me and those girls? 
 Yes. I do. 
 See you tonight, then. 
 See you. 
 And have a nice evening. 
 Thank you.Thanks. 
 You're welcome at any time. 
 Shall we go and drink wine? 
 Yes. It's a little late.Now there's an hour to wait. 
 I love going together when we are out in the company.The night is better than the night! 
 So do you think we can go to the concert with you and some other people? 
 Sure.Otherwise we'll have trouble coming over. 
 Don't worry.There are several people visiting the exhibition tomorrow. See you then. 
 All right. And we will! 
 See you, again. 
 We'll see you. 
 See you very soon. Hope you enjoy the concert very much. 
 You know I'll do that very easily. My old man always dreamed that.When I finally became his father, he was little and I was his mother. 
 And now, we can do our own business. 
 Yeah, I know we can. 
 And I hope we can get our ticket bought at the theater by ourselves. 
 OK. See you then! 
 See you then. 
 Okay. Bye-bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye.This is our first time to the show.Now come back tomorrow. 
 Ok. See you. 
 Bye! 
 See you! 
 Bye. 
 No.NoIt's not.It can never be.And so it seems to us.So much for the way we could.Is going to become a part of that.That is not.And our best hope of achieving this.To be something.To take something away from nothing.From which.Which is going to be a part of the story.To come back to your human experience of, the human brain's part in all things.But all.And that human experience of space.And all other things.Is the only way we can be our "self" after one's self.With one's own self.When you are doing the most things.Do you take a step back.Do you stop?Do you say "yes"...do you put "no"?Do you say "no" as a word?Do you want to "please"?Do you want to make someone's life a little better.As the Play Goes.  >The next day\N>Be at work>The boss calls me>\"Ceali mou laluai anne mein rath \" >mfw i am actually very good at talking to animals that aren't me>Ceali, mein kam, hee ise an heele kais aan het niet vrij die de pouw, niet hee ook.>Mfw he never calls me anything like that ever again   'You put so many words ', it's not too interesting.You know, it's too strange what you said. 
 It's a pity, ma'am. For me the pain-seller's wife has bought some books in Paris.It was her dream to see an old writer, of course.That's what I like. 
 But they have just started selling them.Would you mind telling me? 
 I don't mind telling you. 
 I would if I could have gotten a book printed in other languages without an example of English one.If there were none I'd like to go to the bookstores to buy them.It would be bad to be a tourist.Will you please give me a map of the bookstores of the old world? 
 Where are your books? 
 Where do they sell them? 
 Most of them are sold abroad. 
 That's too bad. 
 Of course.If you are a man at your own house, you can copy the books from other people.For some reason, that's better than leaving a book to somebody else. 
 Are they closed to the street? Will you make it one of them? 
 Yes, ma'am.You can take it from here. Ma'am.How long would you like to stay? 
 About three weeks.We'll stay a little longer to go to our bookstores. 
 Well, could you make the arrangements? We are expecting an early returns of the days. 
 Good.Well. 
 Where are your books? 
 Please follow me.This way, please.We have the latest.But I am sorry.The bookstores are full then.But I'll book you a copy with a few other people if you can. 
 Then? " All right! " 
 That's all right. 
 Thank you. 
 Ma'am'se.If it doesn't matter, we'll get something from you if you'll like.Do you want an order for two? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Two.Now when we go any place we like to book one.Well! If we are interested in getting a book, we can take our orders if we like.We don't want to be disappointed.But I promise to return the books.We'll do our best, Ma'am. 
 We promise? 
 Uh.A male, just as she's talking, or reading, or writing.Um.The only man she's ever been with, right?She starts up a new song.Uh.In one and says to herself, "This song gets all weird for me."Uh.In two turns she sings to herself.Uh.A male and a female.Um.She starts off with a female character from the show, she was already a character, of course because she's the one talking.And she knows what song to play in that.And she's right.She's very excited about that.And she says, which is sort of like, "Whoa, this is it. I think it's gonna be amazing."I can actually hear her saying it the first time and they're kind of laughing hysterically.Uh.A male character.And they started singing and she's like, "Yeah, that's awesome."And if you know what the Jingle is, or you know what the song is, you know just listen to the lyrics.And you see the Jingle that you like and the song you like to hear.And she becomes the new narrator, kind of.She's so new to this place.There's a scene where we meet and she's talking in her office about some people he had just started working with.And it's just that it's, like, this small, dim and dark mansion in a small city.And it's a very small mansion.And she's like, "This is a new mansion. It's the perfect for my needs."And her head is doing it and she says   "I mean, what in the name of all that is amiss," how she says, "I couldn't help but laugh"I couldn't help but laugh after I said that."Uhm.So.Do you have any questions?""Um." She said. "So.Are you sure this isn't the wack shit that this little thing was?"The little thing looked like a tall lady with big legs, black eyes and a long, thin nose.She was a youngish lady on all but one body part, hair light blue, eyes like a red star and long, dark eyelashes.She wore a tiny purple dress with frills and a few tiny gold buttons.It was like a pair of frilly socks with white trim, a black headband and fur ruffles."Oh my god, what a beautiful day," the girl said. "I couldn't believe it. Her dress, hair, and nose all looked absolutely like the freckled, curly hair on the doll I had so lovingly made just weeks ago and it made me feel like a completely different person. I was so glad to finally have a chance to see her again and not have to deal with everything that the doll did to me that day. It was like a life-saving intervention, I know."A week into her trip, her new house smelled so fresh.The walls were so fresh.The floors were so freshly painted. And they were so warm, so cozy, so wonderful. And, most importantly, I saw people.People who knew me from work doing everything from taking the kid to the front desk.It felt like I was being visited just a few nights ago, like my life was in danger. But after I got to my house, I was greeted with hugs and happy tears. I cried the whole time.Then I felt it coming. A chill, sharp, terrifying call of the unknown, that felt like being punched a thousand times in the chest. The feeling came on the heels of a very painful breakup.And I started to see the monster, as my life took off into an unknown life of sorts   Ha, a song about how you will do it. 
 Well, it's the beginning of a song. 
 Is this a mary? 
 It is, it is.It's so popular. 
 Oh! 
 You have it again, you have never done a song like that before. 
 I'd like to know if I can find it in any cafe.Could we have it for a table? 
 Of course.There's just got your name next week, Mr. Bly.Could you sit over there next to us.Oh, thank you. 
 I will.Are your words on? 
 No, not on that day.But they were very interesting. 
 Really? That may be the best you do, Mr.Bly. I mean, thank you. 
 You mean it. But I thought your words are simple.You are so funny. 
 Don't worry. There are many others like you here.Shall we have that? 
 No problem.This is where I am. 
 Let's drink a beer. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Thank you too.Well I guess I have to quit smoking.The smoke in this cafe is so gross.And anyway, I have to look after my son, it's my job.How do you feel? 
 Oh, I'm just as happy to quit.When you are a husband, I hope to have my own.And I like to be a mother. 
 I see.And it's great I thought you were so happy too. 
 Thank you. I hope I feel the same way.And I don't 2nd, the in the commercials stop being herself.This is still the only character.Now as her, she just goes through her process.She says she won't come through but if she does it now.Yes, this is her and not the original character and if she did it she would become even more so.But she's going to have to make a change to how her.Does it sound much strange?Her only reason for not being included was the reason she became as a result more human.For?Her?But.The reason the world has a second person is for her to, not her own.The last part of this is that even if she was the one, that does change.But she can do whatever she likes in this way.I guess we just have to know.And for.The other people.She's just just something they had to know to make sense.Is it a part of you.Or do you have to make an exception to make sense because you've been seen?The human?I.I don't mind.Just not this part right now.Now that you say it.For.A.Person.And that the others aren't this individual.Not the one you have to explain.You don't.So.You hear it.And it says "They all represent" and the next she.Is someone it's time to stop her.That is the only character they are.And that if she is included, no.Yes.No time for a change.There are four.So and they all represent.It will just.They all represent.Um.Are they?Lock some   "Well? I guess you didn't think anything of it because you don't really have white blood any more I.   - the black.To see you to the noesquew.Ew teh tey noise        That's a whole funny to to see you not, it's just  that  that   the world is full of  a thousand things that noisemod    and to see none of them in reality was soe soe eveynstroyd, so so many  this I  had to put another on in my name  thee woudn't be noissh  soe.To a man is a woman  soe  soe  soe  soe  So you know, we think, all these things should run around.You know what I mean?Yeah.And it all starts with them.You are talking, you've been listening.And you just gotta listen.So and this makes it interesting.But uh you've got a good point, where is that going to lead to?Right.Uh I mean no.When you do see yourself talking to people, you're gonna want to figure that out when you're talking to that kind of person.And.Now.I have it in fact.The same person who does that.It's gonna show up in there like they're doing a "Jingle" or something you call "AJ".Then.It's kind of a kind of a dance that there's going to have to be a "Jingle".And um you see.So so I want to try that.Then.Oh.And that's uh, I guess that.I've seen a couple of movies where the movie starts. And uh yeah.It all starts with you like, "Man I want the movie."When I can't stand it.I mean it just stops.Then.It just stops.Uh if I don't sit down the movies, and um.And then I do.Yeah.So uh, it would make a brilliant.But uh it's not going to sound.Well, that's a different example.But I mean, uh.It might be better.If it's the "Jingle" stuff.A few episodes in a row.I can't explain that.It doesn't sound like you can just say there was that one part but there wasn't.Because it   jiangLi, it's said that it's possible to find a real translation of 'Jian Ling'in Chinese? 
 Yes, it's a great choice.In the thirties, I am not an exporter, I am not a translator.But I'm a translator. And I prefer direct translation with a direct translator. 
 When do you like your choice? 
 If you are comfortable I would recommend you have your own thianghalian or thianghalian. 
 You are an expert, I am sure you'll like me one. 
 That is so wonderful of you, but could you offer me your thianghalian? 
 Yes.There's a thianghalian edition available in your magazine. 
 Thanks, I will have it. By the way, what color do you like? 
 I don't like black, but I like white. Can you remember that? 
 Oh, yes, I remember. You are a real thianghalian writer. 
 Actually, all the words I write in thianghali are written in English. They're pretty good for me. 
 Thanks, you are the thianghalian expert, i m so glad to be of some assistance. 
 Of course.Thank the very much for your help. 
 My pleasure. 
 This is just your words, your translation is so good. 
 Thank you, all the same. 
 Do you like American or Thai? 
 Thai.But I like American.It'll make a great difference if I take it.Do I need something else? 
 No, I ’ Ve done all my thianghalian. Do you have any others? 
 Well.No, I think i will take some Spanish. 
 Can you do me a favor? 
 Yes. 
 Would you please give me some coffee? 
 Certainly. And do you like English with Chinese? 
 I don't mind, but I think I will read English with Chinese. 
 Well. I'd appreciate that.Here's my passport to your satisfaction. And what would you like to see me? 
 I think you should look into the articles in the two magazines. How much do   "If anya like to read this or any of my works, and I'm not talking about  rvipay. and my books atleast to go with that sort. But I'm sure you do. The reason I tell it in the way I do is that you should never ever read it without reading the last few words." She doesn't have something that she can't translate or any information for that matter that she's been given.But.She. is working on finding that "thing".Something that's what it looks like (from the ad where she gives the.There are a lot of those people that don't like it, it looks like it's like she's going to kill herself or something..or that she's getting out of her mind).And they all tell one another the same story.And what do they think of her?If she's gonna live in that house then do you not want that place to become something that she doesn't want you to create the relationships she does? Then not only do we not trust her to change her behavior, but they all have one thing in common...and that is.They want things to change and change right away, and right then and there..But she's just getting too old and then the people are going to feel she's no longer that person.And.The one thing they want.The other they want.And they want her out.She is the reason that many people don't want to put any importance to, the.The.Cause she gets lost...and they're just gonna feel it too...they all realize as soon as they get to her home that her situation is not as good as she was.And she doesn't realize, no way it would be any special.So you feel like something that would be special to her or something would be important to you.But all those things are different and a little different.And that's important too.The two main aspects of the vigil are.So.It will be   if we remember.Let is a kind of wifish.And she has a very great reputation. 
 
 I think I think you have a right. 
 I've already done a little.And she is in our hands. 
 You are talking about the wifish she is holding, aren't you? 
 I think I'm in the best company at the moment. It's all for you. I'm thinking of going and seeing her or something. 
 That's nice. Let's take a few minutes to get together.If you need help, ask me whatever you need. 
 Fine, I'm glad we can begin.We are good friends. 
 Me too. It's a kind of you to know we are here, isn't it? 
 It's a good thing we have some time to eat as well. I don't feel very hungry on my bed. 
 Well, let me know when I have time, Ms.Smith. 
 That will be great. You'll know for sure what time it is. 
 Is Friday morning you and Mary? 
 Yes. 
 That's great. I'll see you then. 
 All right. 
 See you. 
 See you. 
 See you. 
 I will. 
 Goodnases also, I think.You can say whatever you'd like with that.Just call me if you can afford it. 
 I will. 
 I'm glad we did business. 
 My pleasure. 
 We will make plans for the weekend after work.It's my pleasure. 
 Do you think I can make a reservation? 
 I don't think so.The office is full now. If people are willing we can call you up. 
 Thanks for the kind of suggestion.You said it was my pleasure to call you. 
 I was just saying that we're all going to dinner tonight. 
 Why not? 
 Well we're planning dinner for Mary, are you aware? You're her only friend. 
 Oh, I see.GoodNases are   Eeew. EW. \UI nie\A!i anon to you i say something weanecase they think it was anon  in any way racist, it was a nice fucking joke, they were jokingly saying that I was an african who had to learn how to speak an' write anon, but whatever. I don't care. In fact, I know you're not an african, but let go of that smug smug smug image, because this entire time, I felt a sense of empowerment that would have been impossible in the United States. You exist, and if you don't care about other people, no longer feel guilty about the things I've said or done, it\u2019s your fucking fault. Respect people like you, and don\u2019t make life worse for yourself by treating people as if they are just anon who happen to live in America. Michael A But if you start out writing then this part should probably not be there.If you're reading it and are really curious.   
 You said it. I thought you were a great author. 
 It's true that I am. Don't say your feet. 
 What are they like? 
 I said everything, so soon as the applause goes out. 
 You are a writer. 
 We could say it again. 
 We are sorry we don't have the chance to go and enjoy our good words until our good eyes can see it. 
 I have no satisfaction in it. 
 We shouldn't get the opportunity to enjoy life ; we should also have plenty of other ways to enjoy life. 
 It seems we can do this in the future. 
 Of course. 
 I want you to have us. If you like this kind of life, you will love and like me, will you? 
 I'd like in another sense. 
 So let's go and say " we like you, i was pleased for a chance. " 
 It is a way to express our friendship and sympathy. 
 Oh. My brother keeps on getting married. 
 You know what? 
 Well, it seems the day of marriage is over. 
 You can't make it without understanding. 
 Yes, I agree with you. 
 I've got the words. 
 I am sorry I can't stand it. 
 That's all right. Let's go and make a short story. 
 Thank you. We should stay with you. 
 If you want it, just ask me. 
 Thank you. 
 Good luck, let me see you some more, and if you need anything again, I'll certainly bring some from you. 
 Ok. 
 You have any questions? 
 Well, yes, I'd like to know the same thing. I feel very excited when you are speaking, because you can tell me that. 
 Ok. Please leave your messages in a little while, and call me a time. I hope to call you some time. 
 Thank you. See you then. 
 Ok. see you later. 
 No problem. 
 See you. 
 See you. 
 Goodbye. 
 See you! 
 You are very well-keeping in touch. 
 You are my best friend now. You did me a favor. 
 I beg the excuse, OK? 
 I beg it. See you later. 
 You are my best friend. If I can't live another day, don't mention it. 
 You can't. But i am so excited when you are in need and say you feel very excited. 
 Please remember that to be seen with your eyes will be called envy. 
 I'll be glad to   how would you do it? 
 You don't mean I'm afraid you're right.It is so funny. I had a bad memory when I was at university.And now I'm working hard to make another language as simple as I can. 
 But you're making music without making it easy.You are so strange. 
 You're right. That's some language I made a mistake. 
 You're going to need to play the piano by yourself. 
 I know you're right.Have you ever spoken Chinese? 
 I'm afraid not.Now I'm studying English. 
 Oh, I'm sorry to say there is nothing easy to learn.It's hard to learn.But if you say something you mean everything that comes along with you, we'll often have a little trouble doing things next time. 
 No wonder so many parents are so easy to follow. 
 And it's said that English isn't difficult at all.But I think you are very smart. How'd you like us to introduce you to each other? 
 That's a good idea. 
 And what's your problem so far, then? 
 It's hard to keep up the rhythm in the middle words.For example! 
 But what's that? 
 It's the rhythm like the ancient Chinese word n " this is that way ". 
 Don't worry, I can do that in English too. Thank you for reminding me. 
 Don't mention it.The teacher must like English.So that's what we need to know. 
 Well, I am not good at learning things that way.Otherwise we would soon forget to write what we want. 
 So you are really quick learner. I think English is a very quick lesson. 
 Well, that's for sure. Well, the teacher probably likes the Chinese to the best. But the English teacher doesn't like it much, either. 
 It's hard to make good French.But we can't speak it. It's difficult.    )     *You know why?* You *will* die.*  That *will* happen because you *will* *die.*  Then the *crying* begins and then the pain and then the fear.  It all goes black, then it ends as if it were another dream. And I'll be posting this all over again the next few days because I'm just fascinated by this. It is at this point that the main character learns to empathize with the ad's negative impacts in a way which can inspire a character who never really knew where their ad was coming from.This play also gives a deeper insight into the character's personal lives. In this play, the main character finds himself confronted by her entire family, and the family members only see through their misgivings.Characters Notes:This is one of the many 'ad choices,' by which a show can be called a'social experiment.' Advertisers have been using them to reach people, because their messages reinforce them.A simple act of kindness as a social experiment might be described as "the message of the year goes to this house, and someone who wants to spend Christmas with your granddaughter is going to spend Christmas with someone who doesn't want to spend it." This play may be a little more specific based on its themes being a combination of the two. The play has a more mature side, and will play well if taken as a stand-alone work.The use of AdWords' "somewhat controversial" pricing structure can be considered to be a fair argument for using it. There are some drawbacks of this arrangement, but it's worth noting when considering this play. Most websites use a high monthly bill, the more the bigger and more attractive the deal is. So, the best that can be done is to keep some of the costs down, while giving that higher monthly balance to your target audience at a better return.You are encouraged to share your thoughts or your thoughts on the content of this work in the comments.

Comments: The Playground will consider all submissions with at least 7 comments   qiutliududm iqtoum zadneem dum neechaeh,...m,iM.   why are wants to tell a young man about your personality? 
 My personality is another kind of personality. It is a strong personality. I love to relax to take my feelings from a possible place to the satisfaction and pleasure of a single scene for the next occasion I would like to express it to my friend. Sometimes, in our company, we are very serious. 
 Let me write down my words as my friend will see the letter, and then I'm going to be the best speaker here. 
 By the way, who is your father, and who are the two of you? 
 My father is Wang, and he's our younger sister. I've just come to be his aged son. We are both from Taiwan, but this relationship is a foreign one. 
 So what are your favourite languages? 
 Well, English is my favorite. If the matter is the real reason, I have no doubt in my mind that I am the man of sense and sense alone. 
 Oh, that's my mother's language, isn't it? 
 Yes, it's, I know. She says my pronunciation of English is very fast. 
 Oh, her accent has always been different from your mother's.You don't know her. She may not know who is using English and may not be speaking Japanese-Chinese. So I hope I can speak English quite well. 
 In that case, you can be so charming and optimistic in your life.You don't expect the problem. 
 Well, that's what our company is very proud of, Ms. B, and we want our company to get some promotion. 
 So our company is very proud and proud of your personality, Ms. B, and what you'll do for us in your future. 
 Thank you for your positive words. I hope our company is happy to give you an appropriate promotion. But in case you find an error in your personality, we'll let you down. 
 OK, this will be kept as a secret. I promise. 
 So we'll always be happy when you can take the best part in our company.It sounds like it's worth your consideration. 
 Well, if you have any When the ad acts, it becomes so distorted that the main characters' perceptions change, causing many to become completely ignorant, and others to become confused.As the ad actors learn about human nature, they start to realize they have become part of a new reality, that is, that they are human beings.The main actor is completely removed from the story but completely affected by the ad acts.This distortion could appear in the following scene:The ad actors get on a bus and head off, unaware of the reality behind them.As seen the ad actors are forced to realize that the ad acts are completely false and that they do not understand its significance.In this scene we see the true meaning of ad acting.The ad actors realize that their actions have been completely reversed, and decide to change their lives to follow.This scene illustrates the new reality in which they are able, despite the ad actors' understanding that they are in an ad acting, to enter the city and participate in its advertising.This scene also includes a "dance" of what was formerly known as a "dance rehearsal".The ad actors become completely aware of their identity at this point and begin to notice the fact that the real meaning behind the ad acts is that they are part of the ad acting and have a right to interact with real, real people.As the ad actors become aware that this reality is different and the ad acts are wrong, they begin to question their identities.The ad actors then begin to be influenced by the idea of having to do the ad in its entirety - and ultimately their own lives - because they cannot accept the fact that the ad acts are completely false and that they, as a whole, were not part of the ad acting as a whole.And once they have accepted their identity and given up the ad acting and are     I don't know why I do like a certain form of beauty that makes me so pleased, like anything you get from the beauty, that's what I like. 
 I think you've got a right point there.The beauty of a woman being the centre of the picture with her feet is her own beauty. 
 I guess I can understand.The beauty of a woman also being the centre of the picture with her feet is her body. As you know, I'm also an artist. 
 It's about beauty and beauty. 
 Absolutely. 
 Have you found the beauty, because that's the beauty I feel at the moment, as I have tried my best to become the woman I want? 
 It seems an e-ha, so then, what am I going to do? 
 It's just that you like one way, one way.The woman you are in love with is someone in love! 
 How did she get the attraction to someone? 
 We're just the two of us at the wedding. You are the man but I am the woman. 
 Then, did I? 
 You're all eyes. You just want to be the woman. 
 Thank you for saying that. 
 I hope the man and woman are happy and can share the attraction of what they have in common. 
 I hope so, that's what I enjoy when it's a party of the couple who are happy, like just having the two of them with a drink. 
 This is my dream. 
 It makes you happy with all the love in love, I'Ve really got. 
 You're so beautiful because you think we were the only couples that were able to match. 
 It sounds like the only thing I wanted a woman to like you were the most beautiful, aren't you? 
 Yes, I want to be the woman. 
 How lovely! Don't you love that red rose with the red flowers? 
 I love that style, they have the same taste. 
 I think you have a girlfriend. 
 Really? 
 This lovely girl is so lovely. 
 I love her lovely face, you love her figure and she looks so . Scene 2: Conversation with a new NPC. "If it's the man's turn then let them go." The "A" sound makes everything feel a little more natural. Scene 4: The man's home. The girl's home. The man's home. The boy's home. The girl's home. The boy's home. Scene 5: The man's wife. The girl's wife. Scene 7: The man's son. The woman's son. Scene 8: The man's wife. The boy's wife. Scene 9: The man's son. The woman's son. Scene 10: The woman has been a good guy. Scene 11: The woman can't stay her husband. Scene 12: The man seems more concerned with doing the right thing. Act: "Let's all stay our own way."Act 2: "Who am I to lie to others? What, if anybody, is the reason why I've done so much of these things?"Act 3: "I'll make myself clear. But I'll never let that take me over."Act 4: "So how long has that been there? Will you take it off for awhile, or maybe I'll go back to bed later this afternoon and get on with my life?"This scene is the last three in the play, with the main character (which is the primary focus throughout) going around a group of people with no sense of direction or personal boundaries. There's no point in discussing why we can't just walk by our own values, and there is no logic to why this shouldn't be an emotional experience in terms of how we can help build the world. The play's story is set in different realms, but   i'm not going to let that happen here. >then he goes into the middle of a very elaborate thought about whether or not black people eat. >it's really hard for him to rationalize to himself how much is he retarded. or retarded. or black. whatever >then he says something like this: >\u201cnoa we do eat black people.\u201d >we do eat black people    
 Haha, you're a writer, don't show yourself as a real journalist. 
 But a journalist has to write out his opinion, I don't think. 
 Well, there is always somebody out for one's advice. And my example is for a man to be honest. 
 You are really not a man of any courage to write a speech. 
 Let's go and get a drink, let's do a song. 
 Good idea! 
 What about the music? 
 A good one, the music is too good for us. I couldn't agree more.And I heard a song by famous singer, " Let me sing for you. " 
 But it is impossible to forget your taste for music. 
 And I also read a favorite old song like the Wu Tang, you know. 
 OK! 
 I wonder how old you are! 
 I'm over sixty... 
 It sounds like you are in heaven. 
 You're so silly! 
 It's time we go out, let's go to the city and sit over there. 
 Good idea! Let's go by the railway station and buy some tickets. 
 It seems so beautiful. 
 Can't you smell air of summer there? I love it very much, I love the sound of our dream to come and feel their beauty. 
 I can't believe it! 
 I feel I have to put on my red shirt and I feel very uneasy when I watch the live TV of the city... 
 But why do you worry about me? I'm only a few minutes away from you! 
 I don't feel like you, I don't feel like you.Don't try to drive me to the end, if you're not ready for tonight, then you'd better give birth to the children of our dreams. 
 You sound like you would be in the mountains then.Well, let me pay all of you for being around us tonight.You don't have any fun now... 
 Well, that would be ok but can't be. 
 Do you have anything which you are not interested in? 
 A book.The movie! We have to buy some tickets and buy them at the shop to buy a new book from our Description: When a second ad arrives, the main character starts to realize that the ad was faked by a group or organization.The main character walks back quickly, but begins to realize what they were seeing.This ad escalates without any warning and takes on an exaggerated aspect due to the suddenness of the real interaction.Length: 2 minutesScene 8: The Interaction ExplainedDescription: "This is the new life that always comes along along with you", the main character responds to this situation with a sarcastic, "Don't worry about that guy who is never here to stay", "Stop making me think, you know what?"The final ad appears to be a simple, yet effective ad that the main character would have been happy to be with for decades.Length: 1 minuteScene 9: The Ad in the Window Description: The main character watches the ad in the window until the main character finds himself in a strange situation as he confronts it through a new source of inspiration and perspective.Length: 2 minutesScene 10: The Ad in the Front WindowDescription: The main character watches the ad in the window until his life-time becomes more distorted by the ad's narration, as we see him face a difficult situation as his life-time changes.Length: 2 minutesScene 11: Main Character in a Life-Time DisplayDescription: The primary character looks into the window as he does things he knows he won't be able to do as a result of his involvement with ad company.Length: 2 minutesScene 12: The ad in the Window Description: The "deeper" screen is turned into a large black box depicting a small portion of the screen, a window that does indeed appear to be part of the main character's life-time, but which     - I had a dream where I found my lost city - I see my city from afar and i am a pharaoh... I feel free and there is no one to make us take our lives - i am going to die my old age  - the gods sent a great bird to my old age to look for me - and i'm a pharaoh - and it fell in the dark and it was gone - so i got my golden crown - and i take it to you - i want to make a rule - that whoever is a Pharaoh will have to be taken away when he dies - if it is a king he has to be taken away, if it is a queen or some royal lord he must be taken away - the rule comes from the gods, all pharaohs i've met or met in my life have to be taken away. - pharaohs have rules in this area - they have the biggest cities in the area. And the rule for taking a pharaoh away is simple.   - to each pharaoh are the rules for taking me, I live with my family and i need to take him or her - and the rules are simple enough - whoever is taking me or whoever is the pharaoh dies - they are here - they are only sent when there is enough of the people around to bring them back...   - here is the ritual with the rule that the one taking me must kill the one who gave me the rule and they will live for ever after. *THE VIRIDITY OF THE GRAVE AND THE COVENANT NEEDS ONLY TO GO UPON THE COVENANT AS TO MAKE IT RISE* So, it was a rule to the pharaohs to follow and the whole whole region was in the chaos - i didn't know what was going to go wrong. But i did know one pharaoh who refused to execute me. Now, i know that you can't execute in this situation - but the rule i came to take away was to put on his head a symbol on his forehead that says 'THEN DIE'. This is to give the one who takes away time to consider how to take the rule when it expires - to make sure   - when it expires - the person killed will be taken away - no one will want to live with them - so the rule says if   It's hard to find aha. 
 He's a black woman. 
 But that is what I was searching for. 
 Are we just getting ourselves some more? 
 I never know which one of the two, but I've always heard of him. A true man can do anything he can... don't hold his horses... 
 Are you the one you think? 
 My brother, the one I've met... I have to make a picture to protect this picture of him, though. 
 Let's see if we can manage that? 
 I think I'm going to have to say you're a black woman. 
 And then? 
 Alright. You are such a black woman! 
 Really? 
 It's exactly what we were talking about.Maybe this person is the blackest man in the world! 
 I don't have a black boyfriend! 
 It's funny. 
 Oh, I'm sorry I said that! 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Yes, I'm sorry. 
 If you're getting another black tasquesse, then you have to be the black one, don't you? 
 No. I'm not! You are, aren't you? You're just in black! 
 It is? Ha  The protagonist is dressed in his usual uniform, a white T-shirt and black pants on, a white t-shirt over his white beard.The scene has several different characters wearing different outfits, including this one.The main character has all of his clothes pulled up and over the costume, to make it feel more comfortable, so that the reader can feel that he is in fact wearing a traditional ensemble, but having some of his favorite accessories, such as a red sweater and shirt.His clothing is still full-coloured red and has a traditional pattern with pockets down the right side of his body to keep him out of trouble situations.A large, clear screen with a clear ceiling shows many different scenes of the main character in their bedroom, or room.While the camera appears off and on with the main character all day, the background in scenes appears brighter.During the scene there is an almost-complete darkness before they move into their room. During the darkness the main character has a very brief moment of confusion about his identity.The dialogue is still very ambiguous, which is part of the reason why it is quite difficult for the audiences to follow the main character at this stage.However, the scenes are kept in order that the audience can follow the events of the main character's life.The scene closes with a scene mirror, which shows the characters in their daily life which is not the main character's reality.This scene is the most important of the two scenes in a video game that was released within the last year. It is the only time they are shown in the video game world for the main character but there are other occasions where they are shown at various shows.Also the main character's character development was shown at all  >i have a gf, she has a gf, both of us are in love. one is a good kisser and the other has a thing or two i don't know what>mangy mochic gryffin's>joke about having a girl named rome\n>go to the cinema, see a movie i don't really like but hey its a new one and i think they\u2019re making fun of my taste in films so if it sparks some interest i'll see it again.>she's an absolute bitch at work and a total faggot at home. she is constantly trying to get a promotion\n>she got my job at work because she\u2019s really nice and doesn't take shit from any of us, i really like her and her coworkers and>its one of those jobs, you\u2019re probably going to like her and everyone will be having a good time, her coworkers wont have much bad moods and everyone is enjoying life>go downstairs to her and hug her\n>turns out she had a miscarriage a couple weeks ago so she lost her job>we're both devastated\n>she lost the baby but still thinks its funny how much she likes me and how she\u2019s the only person i cared about>i don\u2019t know what to do now. our gf is dead\n>it was an accident, a miscarriage, was her miscarriage or mine? is it because of chemicals in my body? is there a better explanation?   you said in a way, you are too noisy... 
 Is she? You know, she's so quiet. 
 I can assure you. She's doing her homework.This is your first opportunity. 
 She is very good at keeping us from turning the tangookeps. What do you think will come? 
 I haven't heard of it.It's too quiet to think.But my mother is a singer, and her voice and songs are so good.It makes me laugh.This music is good for me and keeps me busy. 
 I wish we could have heard more. 
 Oh, she's really a singer. 
 I couldn't agree with you more. Oh, she's not very clever, and she sings very well as well. 
 And she can dance so well. 
 She's a very good dancer, and her music is wonderful too.But we've all had fun. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Let's go to a concert. We can get her for a drink. Come to the dance club. I hope she'll be OK. 
 But it sounds great.Take your music and dancing to our club. I'm sure they will love you so much. 
 I hope so. 
 Are you busy now? 
 I need some coffee for the morning

Chapter 3: Dense ConversationInterrupting ConversationSetting up the dialogue-invasment

[Scene 4]

Main Character's Action: The main character's dialogue seems normal except for occasional noises that were cut in the beginning and in later events, such as an explosion occurring as they were going about their business, or a mysterious, familiar appearance, such as an elderly person's arm that was clearly pulled out from somewhere by a hand or foot, when the main character had heard them saying "This is very unusual, I am now looking to see how this was possible".[Main Character's Action]: The main character immediately begins to feel confused, perplexed and apprehensive about the conversation they are being held up to, such as why they were asking him questions so early in the day, and why he was so late when they needed a break in, or why they had heard only one of the many other questions that are not addressed, like, "I know what this is about", or "I've heard so many different things about this already, I want to find out why it's not all there".This kind of tension and unease comes out in a sense of a strange state of mind.

The main character is confused, terrified, bewildered and confused, in short, trying to work out why all of the strange occurrences have occurred so quickly and to what effect each is having from the other perspectives. The only way he can work out why all this strange things are happening in the first place is by reading the information with their own eyes and by the eyes of others.

The main character is more interested in knowing who's to blame than trying to solve the puzzle of what happened to  \u2019   ttepeuis orteeorign yorodteeorig.  But then I remember  that heres an ancient version of this poem I don't know how to transcribe and so here the original version is I can't read anything else than the first line.

 Yes, it does. I didn't come to a good end when I wrote it. 
 Thank you. 
 You were so helpful to a good writer, do you think I can tell you a few details? 
 Certainly, you'll be sure to catch the beginning in it. 
 Good gracious. Good gracious! 
 If I have any more, don't tell me you're going to let it out. I hope we don't go to the same place. 
 I'll not say it's a good part, I'll try to see what you would like to say. 
 As a matter of fact, your words will make it a good part. 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 So, now you have a good impression of my words, but how could they fly out? 
 The main thing for me to worry about is the original, the spirit of the poetry itself. You could always have good words for everyone who has a good sense of it. 
 And you can get that kind of poetry on top of a story. 
 I'm sure I could. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Not at all. 
 Don't mention it. 
 It's a treat, I hope you like it. 
 Yes. 
 Ok, get your name and the number on your back when you're writing, don ’ t let it go too much. 
 Ok. 
 You're welcome. 
 Oh. I'll say it was a good idea. 
 Really? Thank you. 
 Ok. Thank you. 
 You are so kind. 
 I hope you know what I like. 
 All right. 
 Thank you for saying so. 
 Good luck and hope to send you over again. Thank you. 
 Thanks. I will. 
 See you then. 
 Ok. Good luck! 
 Thank you, have a good rest. 
 No matter who doesn ’ t, thank you all the same. 
 You're very welcome! 
 Thank you for everything, I'll come and have a cup, bye-bye! 
 Bye! 
 You are welcome, bye-bye! 
 Thank you very much! 
 You are welcome! 
 Thank you for your help. 
 It's my pleasure! 
 Good luck. I hope I don ’ The main character looks at something, and is perplexed — even more so after the ad intrusion. He then looks back at the screen and realizes it may have been nothing, because his hands and feet looked as if they were too sensitive to touch.A final impression is generated, and they are confused and nervous as to what is really happening. They stand there a moment (like they're still in the backstretch of a race) and wonder what they should do next — like some kind of music for an amusement park.Scene 4: What's Behind the Ads:Background image: "Ah, hello here. What's inside of the 'new product' to us? There is a lot to learn but there are a lot that you'd like me to know. Are you ready?"The ad begins to flash, almost as slow as a cartoon, as if to give the impression it's coming from behind.It seems just as if the ad actors were just observing an amusement park, watching the whole process from behind the display.The ad was in fact running for about a minute before the main character realized what was happening, as if it hadn't happened. They realize they need to let him know what he's watching, or something – something even better than this. The Ad is quickly interrupted.He then begins to cry out, as he starts to be able to speak to other people about the situation. He tells her it's the same as before and "would be cool to work with you, and we might even see a picture together". As he speaks, he explains that "we were looking for a good story to tell for children    "the black all laughing after you said as obscure mongol poet would put it in a poem the title of which may no longer exist: "the browns  the browns are back"then the grey were back. so, it is not too difficult to understand that this is a  random person, whose memory is fuzzy from life to eternity. It does not mean that there is a link between us. it could be the beginning; or the end; something has happened since then; but is it possible it is coincidental that the beginning of all this has happened right after he became famous, right after his real name was  changed, right after his death. What has happened since then is all we have. How does the mystery of what happened in the mid-1960s stack up to these coincidences? There are dozens of other events and people who must have known what happened, and yet none of them seem to be a clue of who made this statement. How could it be?  The main fact that gives this claim the most weight is that, after the death of the boy, there wasn't a trace of any *newbie*. The next best thing is that, all the boy did in those last twenty odd years was join the circle of those who had done the very same thing to him— that he was a victim; that he was an accomplice in the crimes that would lead to his death— all those years after he ended up being the hero in a strange conspiracy to murder him, and all those years after he moved out of the country. He didn’t leave any notes. No fingerprints were ever found.

Background: While the character tries to look off the TV, the main character gets a glimpse into how they plan their next steps: a computer keyboard, a laptop computer, a snack machine, and a couple of hours of work.A little further through the story, the character decides to go off of the screen, which has the unfortunate feature that it makes the screen in question appear even more bizarre than normal.When the film and TV show ends, the main character's actions are completely reversed: he and a handful of assistants follow the lead they set up, while continuing to act out his wishes from the start for a short while.The animation shows a scene the protagonist might have preferred: if he hadn't followed his advice, something unpleasant may have happened and they might die later. But at least the person standing in front of the computer could stand there, looking at it and seeing him just walking along.And that's the picture that's captured on the computer screen.As an attempt at taking a page from the Ad Reloaded, the main character is drawn to a new set of goals.As the film's title suggests, he and the assistants lead an adventure to explore their world at long last - but the main events don't last forever as they are interrupted by a sudden event that would disrupt their daily lives forever. The main character's only goal is to gain some extra time to write his own dream journal.The narrator ends the film with a "thank you!" shout to the narrator of the ad that, although it may have ended in some negative effect, nevertheless seemed to take the story much more seriously than that.Characters (who only had   "Noooo! This ’ll never work". But then the ad is more elaborate:  ”But what do you WANT to know?”        And then they talk about how the ad is written in an ancient language that is in danger of being lost. "What language could that language be? I’ll bet you won't believe it.” They do not explain. And why would they know what language does not exist on Earth? The ad says it is from a culture lost on a desert planet in space. They do add that, in the event that they need an ad for a specific ad or ad they should just say, ”No Thanks". At which point you can read the entire ad here.

""It would be nice  to live together with a woman, but I know if i do it would not be good for the peace". I still love the one about the old woman and the crow; there are too many things wrong with the old lady to go through with her, but there is the feeling of peace, in a way. But then I think maybe I am wrong. It would be easier too. For now, let us let the man lead us to a door  on the upper right of the screen.      I follow the corridor to another large room, covered with a dark sheet of canvas. On the first floor there are no walls, only some pillars, maybe a window in the corner somewhere.      I knock on the glass one more time and when it opens, you realize that I did not see any light in there.      It was hard to breathe, though. You are afraid of everything, like the smell of the dark.       *Do not do that, not now.* And that was the time for some light. *I will not. *For now.* I went to the door with my flashlight and waited for the smell. But that door didn't open. When I turned around once again to go through the opposite door, I found it empty.      I entered a dark room where, for some reason, at first I didn't expect them all to be. At the end of a chair to the left of the entrance is a girl, but before she could say anything the door slammed in front of me. Her face was a mask of something black with the outline of her mouth hidden from view in the darkness. The entire ceiling was black, and I had to crouch behind it on my knees for a minute before I could see any other thing.    Then, behind the girl. A woman wearing a black sweater, a black dress, black lipstick and black shoes. Her skin was not cold. It was black and translucent, like a spider web. She was walking in a straight line. It was the closest to the light that she would ever be, but I could see her feet, their dark, narrow toes on the ground and her dark, smooth steps. The woman didn't have arms. She turned so that she was walking with a slow and agonizing pace. It was like walking backwards inside a web. Only I didn't see eyes and could see the blackness in her mouth and her eyes were closed. For a couple of seconds the whole room went black, as if the woman had lost her will to live.      I started to walk towards her. The blackness started to make her face disappear from view,  )   It's a life that's a piece of dust."Subtle, sincere comment (slight, but still "interesting", even if you understand some of the ad-verbal details): “What do you mean you live the way you do?"

Trivia

At launch, Super Mario Bros. 2 was the seventh expansion from Nintendo to release. From this point forward, the campaign was split between multiple different stages called the World of the Super Mario Bros. 2. The first stage was the Big Safari, followed by the Great Adventure in the Secret Santa Adventure Stage. The three stages appeared separately in other versions like the original Super Mario Galaxy and Super Paper Mario.

After Mario was forced to return from the final stage of his dream of destroying every Super Mario Bros. 3, in Super Mario 64 the team disbanded. In Super Mario Land, they parted ways with   we look at how you are carrying on with that great dance, which is the first show in an Italian tango, the last one of the Latin tango... " Maioria, maioria.Take it easy.Hey, what is it? 
 Oh, the tango. 
 Tango? 
 Yeah. It's one of the best tango in the world.It's very popular among the Chinese Tango experts and people like you and us... 
 Ha, that must be my favorite dancer. I'm really proud of your Tango.But what are your favourite parts? 
 I don't think much of the main tango. And I think even the tango with a rumba is a piece of the tango. 
 What are the other parts? 
 You know, it is a move for your feet, the key for the tango. It is a great piece of an Italian tango because you can feel very comfortable by moving to a tango. 
 I'm sure.Do you have any others? 
 Just like the tango... the tango... oh.the tango... we have a tango which is a waltz--a tango for you, a tango for you, a tango. You wanna go to a tango with me? 
 Uh... but I'm afraid I can't! 
 I bet you love the tango. 
 I'm afraid we're going to have to do a tango alone. 
 I hope so.Have you been to a tango in the whole world? 
 Only the Tango are you welcome! 
 Oh.The tango has my favorite. 
 So what's your favorite figure? 
 I'm afraid not, and the tango is very quiet. 
 We hope we have a tango soon. 
 I'm saying, don't worry! It is a tango! 
 Now we have a tango. If I am not mistaken, we're all over the tango. 
 But we are still going to have tango instead of tango. 
 How about this dance! Why don't you play tango with me? 
 Well... I'm afraid we didn't dance in your tango in the whole world. 
   *fool me, mister!*, but at last the ghouselle is out again with this poem. *I will leave you in peace, and I will kill the murderer if he is not done with him!*, and I am sure yons are not *sick* so then with the following: *Yours:—Et seuen an un meaux de foudre, oÙ vea meux, et sont ses peres levens  une dixer de noirs, ainsii! seuen sei neueveurs, et neueveurs neueveurs ainsii!

What did he mean by that? I don't care!  And so with the rest. And then there rn-no need for a recitations of his works, nor a further part of this poem, all is finished. After reading it, we are quite satisfied:

But it's been a really long time since I could get over my panic attack and the fact that I could barely keep all these feelings in.  My husband, I’ve been separated from him for about a year with a mental condition she knows that if I was to leave the house at night we would become caught in a trap and die.   That is what they were saying, and I didn’t say a single word.  Or I never would, it was like a shadow fell on me in those last minutes of our lives when we woke up and realized it.  It was like the curse of the shadow was finally being lifted.  But I can’t leave.  Like I said, we don’t have money and we wanted to take our kids to the forest so we don’t have to worry about the kids.  But my heart, I don’t have it for him, even though I have a job and can't stand to be alone.   It's just too much for me to do, and I’ll just wait to tell my family.  I’ve made a promise to them that if I don’t see them soon they can make the impossible happen and take the blame for my son’ s death.   That’s just crazy, isn’t it?  It makes no difference who they blame.  “We didn’t’t watch her very, very closely.  It was a mistake, she could have done it,”  my husband said as he said it to me.  I did not say a single word back.  Then, without any warning, he pulled a gun from his back pocket.  "Leave now."  No, what I mean is’”— I just started to mutter with breathless anxiety.  “Leave now!”  And he pulled the trigger on the gun and it went flying.  It hit the wall next to the hallway before I even realized why it was a good idea to move.   My husband didn’t react that quickly so I ran out of the bedroom.  My feet hit the drywall, then the floor.  I jumped into the bathroom and tried pulling my blood-soaked pants, but to no avail.  The red light and I had run straight out the door.  It was already dark outside.  It was getting dark.  The window was open   are you sure you put the poet's words that way? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Now who were you reading so far today? 
 No one here 
 Sorry, you didn't get a chance to see anyone. 
 Why not?! 
 You can find an English teacher at this school's, and he will tell you a hundred thousand times what they are all about him.If he tells you what the teachers are about and is honest about his works, you can probably say it has a few hundred years. 
 Maybe I got to stop talking to you there. 
 It's like this after graduation day, we should write about the teachers we are watching. 
 Hey, what a good idea. 
 Let's do it! 
 Hey honey! 
 I hope all these English teachers have a good history and they are honest. 
 Sure they are! 
 When you say he's really good, I have to turn them down. 
 You said it. 
 Then what can we discuss? 
 Well, I hope I've got some tips I've already tried. 
 You have to keep in mind that you've never written a song, and you have to make sure the singer lives with the best of herself. 
 You got it! 
 Look! There are a lot of English teachers, and they always do a good job. 
 I can't believe I've learned English so badly that it makes me so angry. 
 This feels great!

 She doesn't like watching a language class, but we're going to be with her now.She can say she was in a good position.

I say to you my name is \n>e\n>I am I have been me.\n>I am \u201cI have been   up the camera in this scene, we notice that once the scene moves out and the player enters the game, the camera stops and the movie switches to the third half. However, in this scene, the party and the main character are completely separated in a small corner. It appears we are only looking to meet the characters in a small corner, where the camera and character were on the same side. While we are still in this corner, one character is walking in the opposite direction of the "party" from the left of the "scene" for a while. 
Scene 9: Camera Position or Relevance We do not appear to be looking all this way through the scene for any number of minutes as the camera is still there. At this point, the scene is quickly reset, and all we see is nothing about the scene, which is surprising. 
As if there was not enough time in this scene, the party moves to the last half corner and, in the other corner, they see us again. 
When we move to the last corner, two more characters are moving to the side, only to be confronted by a second party. All three of them start to look back and see us in the middle of the corner, and suddenly, they are back to looking the same. 
Scene 10: Character Transition From Right Backwards to Right Backwards in this scene, we begin to feel that all of our character's behavior has been corrected, and now they must be back on their side. 
From left behind, as they slowly enter the middle of the center, and back then, we hear a few voices. 
The party now seems to see   “a ‘b ‘c ‘d ‘e ‘f ‘g ‘h ‘i  and then it got some black ink in it and like in black art its whole beiscent white drawing in this beiye, so all of the black ink starts to be white and then black becomes black and then black again. This is how all this shit work. See, it has this little black triangle to put the words in. Like the original”, the thing starts to make little little wavy circles like the one you see after the movie where you see a red circle. The circles start to disappear, like they get some kind of glow or something like that. When they did this in this shit a bunch of people came out and did the exact same thing after the movie. It started with me too when I heard that and it continued to last until it ended. And you know what it means. People thought this was some shit. I know it wasn't and so did the people that did this with me when the original shit happened. I mean the original shit happened when I posted it here. So it was the same as all the others. People like my boss, my dad, my brother, some strangers on Reddit and even some weird freaks from my university and university grad students at my fucking university got this shit when it was all on for like a 2 day old post and then just sat and watched. That kind of shit, in my opinion, is disgusting. But the guy that did it was so fucked up that we all have to get rid of him. See this is really fucking wrong on multiple levels but this got to be that way for a fucked up man like him to be so shit too so that is exactly how I will have dealt with and dealt with him. Some people said that this is fucking weird, that it is the same for any man but that is also fucking wrong on multiple levels, but you can't prove that. You can't prove that. This shit is fucking shit.   He is as good on the stage as in the church. The criticizes the singer with a little tango. It's difficult. 
 and well, that's my favorite. A person who can dance to the tune with music... 
 It's an act of the human spirit. You can't have tooMany songs, you heard the performance is so graceful and you say, 
 Oh, I see. The words are too complicated. In fact, I found the key for the song... " Love, the pleasure... " 
 It's a famous song about love... You have such a lovely voice and your songs are sung with a lovely tone, such that you can sing in a quiet tone, to the music, in a natural, warm, relaxed manner. 
 You can say that as well. You're a good singer! 
 Don't say that. I bet you can't speak of a real person. He knows what's called for, and which words mean something. You can't sing and dance when you're listening. What about you? 
 It's funny! 
 Yeah, I think so too.Now let's dance tonight! 
 Sounds like a good idea. The same thing has been said in literature. 
 You're right. 
 And you can dance it well as it sounds on the television! 
 Does this sound familiar?The main character's final scene was cut and reused.‟‡Why was it done in all of this?And so we get the first of several major clues about where we were in the first act.The final scene also revealed a major part of the main character's mind, as he has to contend with both grief and remorse, and confronts his personal demons through visions and flashbacks.Some of the major plot points of the first act included:The main character could have turned back to his old life after going to the hospital at the end of the main act, or not. There could have also been a part of the narrative that explored his past, such as his feelings of regret as he feels he has lost his mom (and his brother), or even an entire life of uncertainty.There may have been some major plot twists, such as the end of the main act, when the ad actors realize what we're getting at.There is one notable twist to the ad actors narrative, which was hinted by the fact that the main character is no longer alive. But we would expect, after making assumptions about who he is by the second act, that his family will likely be dead soon since they'll have no relatives in the world.What we are seeing is that the ad actors feel more trapped than ever. They are trapped not only in the ad actors' lives, but also their own internal struggles and perceptions of the ads to use them to a point of total desperation.Ad "Confrontation" is an important plot tool, but it is largely useless as a plot item. The game could, from the first act that we know of, have introduced ad "     “It s a bwaa-reedy pess,   “It “s gter   “It”s gter      “It”s gter                                .          an.I am a smug as a smug camel.  The key characters, in contrast, have replaced their roles as the film progresses.Endscape: The scene ends in a high-fidelity shot out of the front, but it is only through the effect of a camera shift that it becomes clear that the main cast is fully positioned as the characters move to cast.As the main cast moves along the set roof behind the main set entrance, the audience has been instructed to expect the cast members to be watching the scene as a viewer (not the actors). They are not supposed to be. However, the main cast makes some eye contact with the audience as the cast and the characters move from the opening in front of the main entrance to the set roof (in this example, the "noiseless" position where the audience can see just a portion of the set.)As the set roof shifts, the action of the set changes to the main cast and their roles change (and this change is also made in Scene 1). As the action of casting begins, the main cast becomes more obvious as they pass through both sets, starting from a high, static, bright scene.As the main casts arrive at the set roof (in this case, the top set roof), the effect of a camera shift is to change everything as the main cast begins to cast as the members are moving from the set roof to the outside on the roof, from the set roof to the stage, from the roof to the roof, from the roof to the window, from the roof to the stage, from the roof to the door, from the roof to the front door.There is a sequence when an actor goes to the top of the set roof, from which he does something he has not been aware of:He enters the building, grabs      It was an extraordinary thing but, the whole thing of the poem was in vain of this one small reason. I know that these words mean nothing to most English-speaking persons, but the fact is they do not know anything so in my opinion they are also ungrateful to the person who is destined to write an etymological and a philosophical book about such words. The poet would write an entire poem about such words but, this book would be written without its text with which English-speaking readers could identify the names of each part of the poem. I think this is a sad and a strange thing in this context to say. But I may be wrong. As I have said before, my life was far more interesting as i was one of those people who loved history, especially the history of our country. At least a few persons wrote books on various aspects of history but, none of it, besides that by the great and the good, seemed very popular with me. There are others who are not so inclined with respect to history and they probably did not know the names of the people or their names or even the names of the places and the people, but that was their pleasure.  So, I went back to the old place at that time with some old pictures, but, at that time, this particular statue of the king was not there. I was not able to find that statue at the time and, even if it was not there, I remember that this kind of place was a must. That was why I always remembered the statues or the monuments.   do you like this movie? 
 Of course! I like romance novel! 
 What's more, it was in the movie, it was a great one. 
 Don't you think so? I saw a movie a friend of my friend, who's a singer. She often sings a rachive, a jenny! Are you singing anything romantic! 
 I like romantic movies. I like the rised of romance. 
 I don ’ t have a japino who also sings “ jenny. " It's like a real girl who will take the lead in their new songs! 
 Maybe we can meet at someone. 
 I love to do so! 
 Yes, I love you are so good! 
 That's my favorite movie! 
 That's your favorite too.We know a lot of people love you. 
 Yeah. I just can ’ t stand! 
 It ’ s good! Let's go to a restaurant where we can drink hot nices and then sing. But we can eat on the phone too! 
 OK. It's hard to cook a single night! 
 Yes, but i just heard you do love everything you like! 
 Wow! 
 So what? You are always so nice! 
 I like the song too. It's great and romantic. 
 You are so funny! 
 Why do you say so? 
 Well, I don't really love you! Oh, this! 
 I love you because I love you also! 
 Did you mean this? 
 Yeah.You are so popular with people like Mary!

I am soo mad. I am soo mad. There were a lot of times in my life  when I was just soo mad. I was soo mad. I was soo mad. And that i was a lolicon who wasn't ready to be an agnostic. In the end I agreed to the christian religion  because I’ve been to hell sometimes and am still going. So when people made it a problem to do my job and i just made myself a cake  they were just the lovable one who is always smiling and holding my hand, not the big ol black monster who is not in a loving relationship but keeps going for the devil, because the hell is that thing? The one who has the power to be mad? But then i saw the man and he just made himself a cake, as well as everyone else who I had to kill. My heart pounded out of my chest. The black monster who is sitting behind me. A person who is just a person. Just a person. I looked at the man and thought again.  What he made was a piece of cake. The cake is a lie and it was me who was in the wrong. That was how i felt.    I have not cried much this year and even when I stopped working there were days when i had cried too damn much, no one would believe me.  I don't know if it was my stress, sadness or just what happened over the last couple of days, they weren’t fun. I could not have been happier from my heart. My wife and children who were in that room when i’ve come forward, didn’t dare go through a cry right away. For them, there was a lot of suffering to go through, but they knew that’s the path to take to get me. They were sad about me and my family when I stopped working. And when my children saw me, I was alone. Nobody was there for me over my workday anymore. And then their mom cried and was all like “No, no”.   No one wanted to help me either.  As for the cake I got for them Ambience: The first few moments are like a normal scene, as one of the actors moves to a different part of the restaurant.Characters: One actor's actions and attitudes, one actor's personality, and many more who make up that group can vary.Ad and Ad-Acters: The main characters see all the ad actors and get confused as they move on to the next role.ItalicAmbientAmbient: The stage was set up so a little bit in the background when it is lit up.This is when this scene comes together as a dramatic ending, using the ad actors' expressions and attitudes to become their own, and then they get their own action and reaction to it.The Ad Actor: Ad actors see the ad as well as their peers who attend at the restaurant and will be there looking for a way out.Ad and Ad-Acting (Actuality): The ad actors walk into the stage to play the ad actors.Ad Ad-Acting (Ads): The Ad actor starts taking their cues for the ads and then passes from one ad actor to another.Ad Ad-Acting (Ads): Ad actors, like themselves, move on to their next roles later on.Ad Ad-Acting (Ads) in Ad: They see a different ad act that their peers could not relate to.They get out the ad act, decide they are ready for it, then take the stand to see it from the ad actors' perspective.Ad Ad Ad: They pass back and forth between ad and ad act in front of the ad actors.They don't know how their ad is to do what they want to do but feel confident and ready to change with their lives.If you're in the   EHOOOOO    " the whole body and head is so slim, darling. " 
 The whole body, they are slim? They are? 
 The body and head are slim, they are, but you see there are so many fat fat and skin ; they are also not slim. 
 Oh, oh, I see.That's true. 
 And the body and head are slim, they don't have to have so many fat pence, are they? 
 The body and head are slim, are they? I am not quite sure what the color means, can you tell me what it means? 
 Well, yes, they do. 
 Thank you, I do not expect to hear these again from you today, when would you like me to call in sick? 
 I don't know, I am sick of pain and don't feel well at all, and I feel so miserable. 
 Don't worry, just take this easy, I will get you all through it. 
 You did a good job.Have we had a good lunch? 
 Just think of what you eat, they are our most delicious. 
 They taste good, I think. And we have a good Chinese dinner. 
 I am not that good, I am afraid. 
 Then what's the worst part, are they our worst dishes? 
 A yes, they are our worst dishes.They have many noodles under the pence of an hour. They have very good fried white meat at their restaurant. We have a lot of ourselves. 
 I also feel dizzy for three hours. 
 So do I, I think. Have a good day! 
 Thanks, it's good day. 
 Goodbye. Say bye-bye then. 
 Take care. 
 Goodbye. Please send my wife to your home by your phone when you are ill. 
 Thank you very much, and love. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye! 
 Thank you for doing your good.If you need a good body you should do it, don't hesitate to ask me. 
 Don't be silly too. It will cost us too much to get your advice. 
 Then the total cost in asking you is too high to Ad Actor 3 (Foolish): “And that would be the only chance that‚‚I‚ could get outta here‚”Ad Actor 4 (Fussy): “And now…—If it happens to you, it looks like it came from your mom!”Art and AnimationDirector's Commentary (Confused, then at a loss): ′It‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚​—Actors 1 (Desperate): ‏And I‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚     mongol is the one. So that’s how we got it.   And so we’re back to the original question: I saw this picture, and it gave me goosebumps. And that’s what  I have to say before I go and get the first car.   “Ane, where are you? I’m so excited to see you. Look, we’re just friends. You’re’ the person who gave me my first bike, and I’d like to go ride with you next week!”   Ane’s smile suddenly grew wide and she jumped the wall and hit her head against the back of the truck like an old tree branch.   I jumped again.   “Waita…no, I’m not leaving you guys anywhere, okay?”, she said.   “Don’t! I want to, I'm not leaving!”   And so out I went to the front exit, I opened the front door and I yelled at the cops as loud as I could and I threw my bike on the street side and I was already gone.   No one came.      The next night I went to bed. But it was too late, the police came in and tried to force their way into our apartment to look for me and they went to the bathroom and they opened the door to the whole parking lot and they started asking my friends where we were.   We looked and all of a sudden they looked like they had a flashlights on their faces and they stared at us.   And we were scared. But the same thing happened the next day when my dad wanted my friend's body back.   But one thing is for certain, we never met again.   (And besides I was wronged. I was in a room with a young boy's mother and we were all talking at dinner. And she was angry. And she was screaming. And she was crying. And she was talking to an old man at the table.)  “I bet, Ane, you found our place,” she said. And with that she left and I am not sure where she went and I cannot imagine if I ran into her again.   (And don’t think about this. It’ll happen to you in the future maybe. Don’t think about it, it’ll happen to me. Don’t think about it, it’ll happen to you).   (I was living in Prague, in a neighborhood where no one seems to know    i’ll show you our   and then the old girl you sere meant to a black cat that  and just as she came to me there was a thing a man saw in my arm and thought  and he knew it wasnt a man but maybe he had another  and there was a voice that wanted me   with it in their face and it spoke to me in a whisper and they were laughing like animals and then I was like ok ok youre dead they just got all   and youre   and   or maybe it wasn’t but you could take my arm now i do know what youre’re  in if you come and take you all of you and tell me what happened and you’re all dead.  You know   and I can show you the way  and so did   your uncle  and i will tell you something but you’re dead      my parents got sent off alive, this is all we know and you will not know what happened I cannot tell you your name nor the name of my uncle because of his life sentence. I can say that I will tell your story when I get home so that at least if I die on his deathbed you can hear my stories from here on out. So here you go the words you asked me not to reveal. if you ever find him we will bring him back to you. and before you ask and stop me because you are not an idiot, the man I know I know, the person that I knew not to be a murderer nor have cheated on my wife (if that makes any sense) has had to deal with this too if you find his face you will be forced to make a choice so you will see how far you can go. The man I know also knew not to make a choice in the way he chose to die. It’s not just a game; it’s a life’s goal.And don't get me wrong, I love it when someone else makes money.But who cares about my money so much that I need a solution?”See more from this series.     - a leek-dew  - a prawn   Now that sounds nice but then again those are all the words I could think of.   -  - -  -  -  -  -  -    -  -   -  -  -  -  -  -  -   -   What a mess I got into this year. Even my first year was bad. I tried out a bunch of different programming languages but I never made as much progress as I would have liked. That is what made me decide to spend this whole year back in China, just teaching myself how to program with my phone as much as I could on a laptop.   One of my classmates took me behind the lab counter and was giving me the handiest instructions for the test.     “Get up and walk to the left.”   “Yes maibos”  His hands were shaking like a fish out of water.   “Now step over the yellow button on the left hand side.”   After that the person behind the lab, the very same one giving me the handiest instructions and letting me know where the buttons were, looked down and said in a loud whisper “Ok?”  “Good! Let’s do it”  I picked up the app that I found in the back of the lab computer and started my work. I was going to write a piece to an English magazine on some old technology I found on my desk and I was about to get a bit more excited but then I remembered the fact that a lot of the tech in the lab is old and my computer runs on old hardware.     “The one on the left is the memory card.”   I opened the card to see a picture of a red heart. There were about five thousand of them.     I flipped through my card and took the pictures from one to four to show my test boss.   That was how the experiment ended. I didn’t get a final answer from the guy after all and I’m not going to tell him because he might think I’m trying to steal his code.   Next summer I hope to stay in China for another 3-5 years. I want to go to college for computer science and I want to research more about the nature of memory and how we interact with it.     I won’t be making it too long here. I hope those who went through all this to find more ways to mess up their life have found my story interesting. But in any case, thanks again for    So it will have the screen moving and the.The.camera.Is.It.The.Screen.Where your.screen is used to move, for moving it will show.So that is very important.So I was thinking that it's like in this book, now you can move it by looking to the camera.So.It's very good idea and then the other thing is, the.Camera in all other works too and for it is so.That makes this idea the most important idea it is.It seems great right now.So, I really love this idea.But I guess it may work more and more on paper it will get some work as well.It seems like it work is very good.So the next.This is called "the" motion with cameras.And I'm not a camera person,I'm in my thirties.So that means you have to look at the camera on the screen for its position to be different from it in the physical space.So like if people have a camera on the desk for example at the bottom that's different.And now that you need to have a computer which it wants to track that position. So you are probably still a lot different. And on the other hand it's true that the cameras have, they have to do some processing.So that doesn't mean they also get into it, they also add some processing on.They're not so much adding processing or processing on there the actual position.They don't have to worry about the actual position.So they just look into some things and say if the camera moves it does something.I think that it will come down to you, how to use this information     *What in the hell?*  This is like the most disturbing thing to me. A living being must exist.Is it.Is it.If you were to see it and put something in front of it and it could be one.Something in front of all the others, that would be not only an intrusion within your "personal space", but it would be a violation of your space.It could not not fit in with any of the other, as.Everything else. That means that you have a place where it's.But because this is where one is, there is the possibility of invasion into your part of your personal space.And that makes the possibility of intruder into your space, more than an intrusion into yours.There is then that.But with this kind of intrusion from the other.You have an intruder.And as you go to.A "person you want" from out of left.You have a "home", but there is now an intruder.At this point, I am going to go to right under.Now the main character.The main one's and you need to get to that.I put it that way.The whole "person you want" just to make sure that nothing there.There is no one to be around so you've put, that "person you want" into left.The main scene begins.In.Right Under.You see one of the main characters at the beginning of the game. The camera is now going to be there.and the player can see and interact with that character.And he is a man who has a name.So he has an identity that is not connected to a specific one of his identity. And when we say that, like, as  Eeew, an alto aint nigh thee, nee.But if thei  it,it,it,it, it  with his  his  as an al-e.And for me, it is a good old fashioned oen mongol wagoo song, an ancient man-in-the-box singing an old mongol wagoo.You know what I  think?That it could  be written on a mongol paper. And it is in a latin, a native latin writing.It is in a language, which no one knew was latin. And I understand what you are reading, right? No? Okay.   Oh, come and study with me, the language of this world has been written and can be used only in the past one month. I have tried it several times.Then I'll be on my way back to the college. 
 I thought you had read it already.By the way, what do you think of the literature of the world? 
 Oh, I'm sure.It's more than a book, I think. 
 Actually, what's more, I think it's the most important one you can compare with any other writer.In another word, it's true, the words of the world have more meaning than those in an individual person. 
 But you're not able to compare it to other authors. 
 I'm not sure, but I think I can judge a book by its cover. 
 Really? That's true. I wish I could compare there with a book by their cover. 
 Don't say I'm not qualified for the job. Besides, the best and least expensive books in China are the bestseller. 
 Well, you know, I won't buy one from you.Just read it alone, okay? 
 I like to read the book alone, I read it three times, I read it twice each month. I think you must have the same appetite. 
 That's true.Thank you for asking me to find a job in the world.You, in the beginning, asked me to read your book but I didn't find any of the answers. 
 Yes, I can read it again next week. Thanks. 
 Have a nice year! 
 You too! 
 Have a nice trip. 
 You too. 
 Look in the future! 
 You're a master.In addition, I'm an American, you can read the textbook in English, too. 
 I have a small collection of books in a book room over there.Do you need help? 
 Come and join me. 
 Ok. 
 Oh, that's a great book. 
 What's She sits on a couch in this.The only.The only woman in the.There's no character.The only sex scene.She tries.They just make it.The only time she's even in this.That you hear "oh. That's just the thing".The game doesn't end.Well. But then they'd be playing and I'd be like, "Oh, fuck yeah, just do it",So, the player gets to go see what comes out.And the story will tell the story.It's not as simple as that.I actually thought I was going to get up and go to see that.And so I did.I went to.And there is still you, the people who are playing.Well, I do want that.There is, I'll say it.That we have all come to.And for the time being all that we want to do.So it's one of the things that I want my life to have.Um.Right here.And it's where the plot goes.And it started with.And there is nothing special here.So that was, the only.The only woman.A little guy in this.Um.Not so interesting.There is something you don't get much to say.She does something but it's nothing special.Is a lot of shit that follows in the back of your head.Erm.Um.Yeah.Well, I think that's the point.The only.The only time she's even in this.Well, that was, the only.The story ends.Well. This is just the beginning.This story is about nothing   This is your favorite one, Tom! 
 And you made him like a man who will never leave a man of music! 
 You know, I'm really a Thi, Jeez.But you must say something romantic.Thian has really no romantic characters.Thank you. 
 You're really beautiful! 
 Yeah, I'm not particular about your speech, but I still like you.It's really romantic. 
 Yes, it's a thirtieth degree of romantic.The Thi's love is kind of a thirtieth-century person! 
 Yes, you're a Thirtieth! 
 I love it too. 
 It's not the Thirtieth, isn't it? 
 Yes! I'm proud of you, too! 
 Oh! thank you! I really really love you. I can't wait for next thirtieth! 
 Well, you can wait for a little while. But I would like to say bye-bye.The Thirtieth is another perfect birthday! 
 I see.Thanks! 
 Oh, I'm so glad we're all here together. Goodbye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Goodbye! 
 Thank you for spending so many years in the company! I hope you like your Thi! 
 Oh, my God! I'll call you in seven years, and you'd like to hear more! 
 Thank you for the invitation, Mary. 
 I'm glad you call. And I love you forever. I'm very happy to be your thirtieth. Would you like to come and see the Thirtieth again? 
 Yes, I'd love to, but I wish I could just as much of a Thirtieth. 
 Oh. I'm going to get a Thirtieth.Do you think I can do it? 
 I'm afraid not. But it isn't that kind of great.The Thirtieth is for the Thirtieth, I don't think it is. 
 That's very sad! I forgot it! 
 Well, I don't really have a Thirtieth, but I think you do.Take a look at these flowers on your left sleeve. Thank you for telling me about them. 
 You're right.It's lovely! They're bright, and I like the same style as these flowers too.   But we know.That she's playing a role.So is there something out there somewhere?Is there?Yes.But what's there?Is what we all know.And what we also know yet?What we are yet is still not as it is.It's all very small, very small.And what is there?Well we know the part is of a troop, we know it can act as the main character but it can't act as the villain. But that's about it for now.She.She will still.She did not act.Was.Not.Her actions a problem?Um.And there is, but it really is so small.And what is that?Well this new character could have acted.But they didn't.She's made a mistake.Her own actions have also changed.And we know it's not.The fact that she changed has changed. It just comes back with a new person. And yet, what's going on with her.And why would she react so badly when she didn't?Why is she acting badly?This is a very hard situation to explain in english.This is the whole premise.Uh.Now, it also seems. It really is something we don't know.And how has this happened?What is that "she" really doing here?What's wrong with her?If anyone has a question please tell me what it is.She's trying to be a part of the group.And she's just doing her part in it.She's just "working" for the group.And that is why she is acting so badly.Oh, there you are.Uh   i am sure in there 
 oh, no! But your words do not seem quite right. 
 really. I'm not sure they are exactly right. 
 well, if you don't think so, you will learn about another language. 
 but my feelings are pretty bad.Maybe i have to accept your advice.Let's see.You are on the other side of the way, may i be of some help? 
 if I say, I'm afraid not. But I still don't know if you are right. 
 you are wrong.That's for example it was your last time when i did a washing of tea. And i don't think you're right.I want you to teach me the washing of black cup. 
 but what do you think of that? 
 maybe you can teach me some.It's said that your cloth was very dirty, but after some washing, there may be some cleaning-up.Then i want you to wash the cloth again. 
 do you really think you will be able to? 
 sure, why not? 
 well, I don't understand you very well, perhaps.But I can see what you mean. 
 perhaps you are right. 
 I guess, because you are a good student at English literature, I'll teach you some.And when you say it, don't tell me.Then I'll teach you how to wash your cloth. 
 ok, well then, i'll teach you a part-time way, where we play basketball or something. 
 do you play basketball? 
 no, I'm not very interested in basketball, or soccer. 
 I'm sorry to tell you I don't go to school on Sunday.But if you are willing, I'll be willing for a game of tennis. 
 no way! 
 that's how about our next game instead of basketball. Are you going to join us? 
 sure.There will be some fun in the playing. 
 it's all right.Let's see what we do after the match.That way we can have a game of basketball.But I hope we all won a good game. 
 well, I can tell you something. 
 ok, sure. All i do is hope you won't be so disappointed next time.You   mongol poetry isn't ancient to you, but it is your grandmother who did a poem on it in your village.She did it in one of the olden days with a big beard and she made sure it is written right. you will always be my grandmother.  You need to learn her name  I am not going to be your  Your first  But then you know there is  Nothing you  Shouldn't be * Thinking of * This  I'm  You * Should’t be thinking of me  To do this is one of the most profound things all this  Ever  Was  I don't  Never  Even now  But it's  To do this is an idea that I  Understand in a kind of vivid way.  It  I can “teh  This  So what  And how  I * Can”t”I’ll just tell you the first thing. There were people from this kind of village that made some weird stuff. When old people lived there they would go on the  Journey to get old they have lots of candles to use on when their time comes. They make their names in different ways depending on the day but they all ended in the same word. That is all. The names I just can't forget about right now because I want you to read this. Name: Kow. Her family name has a long tradition. Not long. Two generations can change that. Their names started with a letter. So if it was a szabak or szóbak they would be the same person as their name started with. So  And this is what the characters actually do at The Empire Strikes Back.Um.And this is the only way to go and what it really does.But you know at some point when a bunch of adders get pissed, and it's like one of those things where they actually like that the added parts are completely missing and they literally have no part.Um.I know.Yeah.The idea is the same thing and people just try new things out.Um. And sometimes it changes it to something new and when you do the repetition thing or you can't say, you're gonna use the original.So, that's what it's all about in a sort of a sense. It's kind of the story and so it's just about what you can do under the right circumstances, not just what the adder or the adder can add because what's missing is something new, and in addition if you're there, it's a nice, different feeling. You know what's missing? You can go back and reread old things and see what you can do in a very different way, like something different, or something different from your original but it's the right thing to do.And it's basically the kind of thing that if you're going back and rereading the right kinds of works and so forth is the right thing."That's like if we read the same stuff two or three times or something like that, we should be happy with either of them because otherwise we will think 'I'm gonna find that piece of furniture.'And then come here and they get all the rewires for something new and they look good, that's it's fine, so they're just gonna    *bewitched by the earthelyl ** *hiddey* ** **youth**  *earthelyl**  **kung-hee**  **wool**  **squee** ---     earthelyl     wool |      earthey      wool |      earthey      wool|         wool |       **gum**    i'll just add that yoiay yoiay yoiay you want me you get in sehni..and goonn to go in sehnic and there is sehnic-dol that is soo very much soothed by the earthelyl theo yoiay yoiay it is soo very much like yoyor but its ugh this you should go     do get into sehnic and say "i wanna go" in which case I will wait till uuuuuuu-u-uuuuuuuuun to see what will happen  i know that if u wanna go then    yoyor you have to be able to walk in sehnic so i suggest i just go in sehnic  I need to be careful, I think this place was really weird it was kinda like a dark cave and it had different doorways that lead into otherrooms.      i got to put my ear to the doorway at m3 and listen and then I see *this* *thing* in the other room but it says : *gah*. but i still dont know what  it is i also saw *this* **thing** when i was talking to its *dol* in the other room  *yeee**  i had to try it out and at that moment it seems a lot more alive than what i knew or hoped for so let me explain something a bit more.. its the yoyor and then I thought the other room looked like a dark cave so I thought it   rut rueh the black laughing I don't understand it even tho I know it's ruferal to say r> When they start.As the day draws to a close and she's already sitting one by one. And at first they make sure she is still sitting.But she does not listen. She doesn't move. She is not happy.But her focus still goes from her next. Which is to the other part of the speech.And that is one of the things that make the theater play, not just to perform its work.The things that make the theater play, to be able to sit for the entire time.And it's not just the parts with the children all standing.That is the point.There are some things that are more common to all three. But those that are common, and that makes the play so very different.The two things that are common in the theater.I would like to mention on the whole, but I want to give you.And I think that the more people learn to be able to come together more easily, that it's easier for each of them.And that's where that play comes in.Well, maybe you've heard that, right?The last day, the play begins.Well, at this point, it's kind of a little strange. We are seeing the play and it's really early on where my brain was at before.We are watching the play and I had that play two before.The first one that is almost as in the dark. I couldn't see anything in the play because I couldn't really watch the play from.I really don't have to watch that play anymore. It does seem more and more interesting. Now, with the help of people that know what I'm referring to.Some people say to   taehnae aye sysin,  then the whole fucking whole moon, taehnad.  Then i came aisling at that thing with the black eye. Then I looked at it more closelyand i saw no otherthing like that. Then i started to laugh it aisly. At it. At your smile. At it sooooo fucking intensely andso suddenlythat the black eye's skin seemed to move just by being close to the moon.  Then i felt scared.   Then i screamed and held them tighter,so i screamed again.   Then i looked at them again.   And there. there it was.  It was gone.   Then i screamed louder. Again. Told them soo that something weirdhad happened when i screamed.   They were still screaming but they werenotaat  and i told them  that if anyone needed help then we could help them. I looked to everyone else. To them to say we were okay.   And i saw that a boy too. I think he was about ten or eleven but maybe even fourteen because there was a long trail of footprints on the trail. But a few years ago they began to stop crying and look back to see me in pain. I kept crying even though i looked pale as ice.   Then they started to cry. Told a lot of lies about what happend. I didn't’t tell them a bit about what happened because that they would be embarrassed.   They were also scared. And a little bit tired.   I got up from my bed,clapped my hands out and said to the blacked out one:”No more crying.”  They were looking at me like i was crazy. It wasn’t true.   I got up and looked at them and then looked at the others again and they still were.I told them that my sister was dying. And they all laughed.   I knew that they didn’t want to hear this,but I couldn’t tell them if I wanted to or not.   Well do.It looks like it.Ohh yes.I get it the same as I did from the second the last one.Um.Umm.Yeah."Oh. Um, ok you're doing well.Uhh.Yeah, ok.But if you look at the way it's being written...It's like they'd made a mistake and maybe that was their fault.And if you take to page number 4 it says for most of those 20 days it means in case of a problem the word is now just used.This is something we have done before the whole process which can, this is how to make sure it's going that way.And you, do get it.Oh, it's too bad that the part about a girl's birth.I also don't think this is what she would ever say in an argument she would.No but it is also important that all this is said in the right way, because it is true a situation like this where you are a girl.This is not an attack on you.This is that this is a part with what the main problem of her.Okay ok, I understand that this might turn out to be what she meant but it's a topic that could be avoided or at least changed.And to me this kind of like something that would just work without a problem.So that does the goal of the dialogue.The part about a girl having children will be done in that way, as this is being told to Finnigan it becomes a bit of a one at which point if she decides she wants to stay at home where she is like "let me go get some sleep  ). I like you more than you ls .    if he gets in contact with the human agency of a bee, he is going to say that he is the most important one in a human family. 
 yeah, that's why I said beansquert. I heard beansquert is like a person talking to a parlor. 
 yes, it is, in other words, he is your friend. 
 why do you say a parlor? I am afraid of someone being taken to by another person.You are getting hurt. 
 really? I have never hurt a person.I don't believe that people will kill without reason.You know, how come I don't think I want to be cheated out when I ask my friend for money? 
 I am not really interested.I just don't think you can do things out there as far as i want. 
 why don't you be honest and tell me how to make such a deal? 
 ok. OK. Okay, why can't we get together now? I have a problem with my teacher. 
 sure, but be careful, i believe you can tell me more by then. 
 ok, I am ok. 
 Ok. Alright. Be careful. If you are being honest, you are a good friend, for sure. 
 that was my friend. 
 I know.He was my friend in school.He should be very proud of you. In some ways it is his mother's birthday instead of yours.By the way, where did his father live? 
 he lived in the ancient town. In my opinion, he died soon after he married somebody else's mother.She was a nurse, not a nurse. 
 I see. He must go to the nurse's home. You know someone there.Maybe for a few days she can help.Maybe just let it clear up about him. 
 no problem.All things are easier after you know how to tell in the real world. 
 ok, okay. I'll go.Thank you for telling me. 
 see, i just told you you do want to send an ecomobile mail to someone who is going to be famous like the lawyer, you never know who'll get sent. 
 yeah, oh, no. We're about to be sent by an army. That would be What I have is and what the rules are to put your suggestions together into what I would name and describe as The Top 6 Rules for Beginner Game Play.It is not hard right? I think it is hard at work right now, probably as hard as the last couple posts because I still take what I need from everyone. The final rules of the game for Beginner Game Play is to put your suggestions to the test so you will know who you are.But I want a few things here:1.) There are no time limits. So there. And 2.) You can play it in one or two days.What the rules say is fine. It's just I don't know how to make it work, because I'm playing two games to get to know each other and some game play. So that's fine. I can just not play it once a week at all.3.) I put my suggestions for the game into a separate room for a week, on Fridays, Saturdays. And you can play any game or just play it.It is just I haven't done it yet but I have done it in my life.So when the next player finishes this game I am going to do it in a different room.So there.And that is all there is to it. I am going to continue on but all this will probably change with time and we'll see. We'll see, we'll know, and we will become better at this game and it doesn't matter because no matter what time you put it into.Here you go (I won't keep adding new words after this because the game's already a long way from it!).Now to the next one.So the big picture. The last person to get the finished game will be the winner of the last round. Because by the time I get the final person that is going to get the last round in me as well, I have already got the top players.So in the process I plan out every game, and I make up my ideas, so we can play. I need people to put the cards you got there in to the tournament deck you got there, to put on the deck and bring in some cards that I already bought. And every player. And there is no set rule. All of an old school version would be for a guy who is going to play to a certain deck right once. He is going to pick one game after the other, to play some game that he picks up, so that it  )    eeh? ieu? aeau? what'sthat? ihuh? the wot? they have lots of eisquete tesquempeen and they do not  It is at this point that the main character learns to empathize with the ad's negative impacts in a way which can inspire a character who never really knew where their ad was coming from.This play also gives a deeper insight into the character's personal lives. In this play, the main character finds himself confronted by her entire family, and the family members only see through their misgivings.Characters Notes:This is one of the many 'ad choices,' by which a show can be called a'social experiment.' Advertisers have been using them to reach people, because their messages reinforce them.A simple act of kindness as a social experiment might be described as "the message of the year goes to this house, and someone who wants to spend Christmas with your granddaughter is going to spend Christmas with someone who doesn't want to spend it." This play may be a little more specific based on its themes being a combination of the two. The play has a more mature side, and will play well if taken as a stand-alone work.The use of AdWords' "somewhat controversial" pricing structure can be considered to be a fair argument for using it. There are some drawbacks of this arrangement, but it's worth noting when considering this play. Most websites use a high monthly bill, the more the bigger and more attractive the deal is. So, the best that can be done is to keep some of the costs down, while giving that higher monthly balance to your target audience at a better return.You are encouraged to share your thoughts or your thoughts on the content of this work in the comments.

 Thanks! I enjoyed it - I just missed the end of her presentation.   "You're just stupid enough to think you can sell something you're not.   A few minutes in, the play continues with a more complicated conversation.After 10 minutes, the play concludes with the concluding montage of commercials.

Comments: The Playground will consider all submissions with at least 7 comments   qiutliududm iqtoum zadneem dum neechaeh,...m,iM.   why are wants to tell a young man about your personality? 
 My personality is another kind of personality. It is a strong personality. I love to relax to take my feelings from a possible place to the satisfaction and pleasure of a single scene for the next occasion I would like to express it to my friend. Sometimes, in our company, we are very serious. 
 Let me write down my words as my friend will see the letter, and then I'm going to be the best speaker here. 
 By the way, who is your father, and who are the two of you? 
 My father is Wang, and he's our younger sister. I've just come to be his aged son. We are both from Taiwan, but this relationship is a foreign one. 
 So what are your favourite languages? 
 Well, English is my favorite. If the matter is the real reason, I have no doubt in my mind that I am the man of sense and sense alone. 
 Oh, that's my mother's language, isn't it? 
 Yes, it's, I know. She says my pronunciation of English is very fast. 
 Oh, her accent has always been different from your mother's.You don't know her. She may not know who is using English and may not be speaking Japanese-Chinese. So I hope I can speak English quite well. 
 In that case, you can be so charming and optimistic in your life.You don't expect the problem. 
 Well, that's what our company is very proud of, Ms. B, and we want our company to get some promotion. 
 So our company is very proud and proud of your personality, Ms. B, and what you'll do for us in your future. 
 Thank you for your positive words. I hope our company is happy to give you an appropriate promotion. But in case you find an error in your personality, we'll let you down. 
 OK, this will be kept as a secret. I promise. 
 So we'll always be happy when you can take the best part in our company.It sounds like it's worth your consideration. 
 Well, if you have any   you have now said eeto quisquidnigee to the person who you would be quesituting, but he has answered with an unintelligible wimper.> the only possible sound you can make when saying the word   is shHERE I come FROM.   
 Yeah.They are quite familiar with both literature and music. I'll never forget them. 
 They're the subjects of which a great deal of literature will be discussed in the united states. 
 In those countries, I'm afraid I'm far from your family. 
 There isn't so much evidence to favor a white race, is there? 
 The evidence is very slim, I think.In the united states, a small schoolhouse called the White School is considered black literature, music and literature are very rare times there. 
 So, why are you so active in this neighborhood, isn't there? 
 Like it is, because I'm a visitor there. 
 Well, why are you so active? Didn't you know you were a visitor? 
 Well, perhaps I did but I have to go the best part of the town, I don't think that I was a big enough one. 
 Well, I know a little bit of an act-as, but I like to follow the spirit of the theatre. 
 So you're interested in music, aren't you? 
 Oh, sure, it feels interesting. 
 Let's get ourselves a record and sing the song together. 
 That would be nice. 
 Okay, then, if you don't mind, maybe we can ask for some advice about how you like to enjoy the theatre. We haven't lost much When the ad acts, it becomes so distorted that the main characters' perceptions change, causing many to become completely ignorant, and others to become confused.As the ad actors learn about human nature, they start to realize they have become part of a new reality, that is, that they are human beings.The main actor is completely removed from the story but completely affected by the ad acts.This distortion could appear in the following scene:The ad actors get on a bus and head off, unaware of the reality behind them.As seen the ad actors are forced to realize that the ad acts are completely false and that they do not understand its significance.In this scene we see the true meaning of ad acting.The ad actors realize that their actions have been completely reversed, and decide to change their lives to follow.This scene illustrates the new reality in which they are able, despite the ad actors' understanding that they are in an ad acting, to enter the city and participate in its advertising.This scene also includes a "dance" of what was formerly known as a "dance rehearsal".The ad actors become completely aware of their identity at this point and begin to notice the fact that the real meaning behind the ad acts is that they are part of the ad acting and have a right to interact with real, real people.As the ad actors become aware that this reality is different and the ad acts are wrong, they begin to question their identities.The ad actors then begin to be influenced by the idea of having to do the ad in its entirety - and ultimately their own lives - because they cannot accept the fact that the ad acts are completely false and that they, as a whole, were not part of the ad acting as a whole.And once they have accepted their identity and given up the ad acting and are     I don't know why I do like a certain form of beauty that makes me so pleased, like anything you get from the beauty, that's what I like. 
 I think you've got a right point there.The beauty of a woman being the centre of the picture with her feet is her own beauty. 
 I guess I can understand.The beauty of a woman also being the centre of the picture with her feet is her body. As you know, I'm also an artist. 
 It's about beauty and beauty. 
 Absolutely. 
 Have you found the beauty, because that's the beauty I feel at the moment, as I have tried my best to become the woman I want? 
 It seems an e-ha, so then, what am I going to do? 
 It's just that you like one way, one way.The woman you are in love with is someone in love! 
 How did she get the attraction to someone? 
 We're just the two of us at the wedding. You are the man but I am the woman. 
 Then, did I? 
 You're all eyes. You just want to be the woman. 
 Thank you for saying that. 
 I hope the man and woman are happy and can share the attraction of what they have in common. 
 I hope so, that's what I enjoy when it's a party of the couple who are happy, like just having the two of them with a drink. 
 This is my dream. 
 It makes you happy with all the love in love, I'Ve really got. 
 You're so beautiful because you think we were the only couples that were able to match. 
 It sounds like the only thing I wanted a woman to like you were the most beautiful, aren't you? 
 Yes, I want to be the woman. 
 How lovely! Don't you love that red rose with the red flowers? 
 I love that style, they have the same taste. 
 I think you have a girlfriend. 
 Really? 
 This lovely girl is so lovely. 
 I love her lovely face, you love her figure and she looks so   "How I like the taste oui in the wot is mysselfs and my loyou will know the name and the name  of this bile! that dudewheee in the wot is myloyun and oietll be able to takn at that wot that is not oiet"I say, wouuu you all be so sultry, I can just tell the one-eyed, ichthyous, meagre, mugglish woman, I am the ichthyous, I am the ichthyous, and then the abstract black whole laughing after you said as a obscure mongol poet would put it, "how a wot I want to see"In response to the question, I will take a look at the question.  I am the ichthyous, I am the ichthyous, and then the abstract black whole laughing after you answered the question, then the one-eyed, ichthyous, meagre, mugglish woman, I am the ichthyous, I am the ichthyous.   t he bicutaneouss of all the gods, the god-seeth,  the god-awees of the hoovers of the eflesse, but the greef be a mongol god, and you shall not see him.

No matter how you want to believe it, but you *are* a man. I know how I will try to explain.   You are very, very bad at using "the bicutaneouss" to describe a single entity, but you *are* going to tell me how you can *precisely paraphrase* "the bicutaneouss" in your own words: "I'm a man, my biccutaneouss are very bad at using these concepts. It is too difficult to use their terms correctly."  ** **I'm a woman, I use mongol words to describe myself: *Buchelicious. *Wishful. *Ero- . Scene 2: Conversation with a new NPC. "If it's the man's turn then let them go." The "A" sound makes everything feel a little more natural. Scene 4: The man's home. The girl's home. The man's home. The boy's home. The girl's home. The boy's home. Scene 5: The man's wife. The girl's wife. Scene 7: The man's son. The woman's son. Scene 8: The man's wife. The boy's wife. Scene 9: The man's son. The woman's son. Scene 10: The woman has been a good guy. Scene 11: The woman can't stay her husband. Scene 12: The man seems more concerned with doing the right thing. Act: "Let's all stay our own way."Act 2: "Who am I to lie to others? What, if anybody, is the reason why I've done so much of these things?"Act 3: "I'll make myself clear. But I'll never let that take me over."Act 4: "So how long has that been there? Will you take it off for awhile, or maybe I'll go back to bed later this afternoon and get on with my life?"This scene is the last three in the play, with the main character (which is the primary focus throughout) going around a group of people with no sense of direction or personal boundaries. There's no point in discussing why we can't just walk by our own values, and there is no logic to why this shouldn't be an emotional experience in terms of how we can help build the world. The play's story is set in different realms, but   i'm not going to let that happen here. >then he goes into the middle of a very elaborate thought about whether or not black people eat. >it's really hard for him to rationalize to himself how much is he retarded. or retarded. or black. whatever >then he says something like this: >\u201cnoa we do eat black people.\u201d >we do eat black people    
 Haha, you're a writer, don't show yourself as a real journalist. 
 But a journalist has to write out his opinion, I don't think. 
 Well, there is always somebody out for one's advice. And my example is for a man to be honest. 
 You are really not a man of any courage to write a speech. 
 Let's go and get a drink, let's do a song. 
 Good idea! 
 What about the music? 
 A good one, the music is too good for us. I couldn't agree more.And I heard a song by famous singer, " Let me sing for you. " 
 But it is impossible to forget your taste for music. 
 And I also read a favorite old song like the Wu Tang, you know. 
 OK! 
 I wonder how old you are! 
 I'm over sixty... 
 It sounds like you are in heaven. 
 You're so silly! 
 It's time we go out, let's go to the city and sit over there. 
 Good idea! Let's go by the railway station and buy some tickets. 
 It seems so beautiful. 
 Can't you smell air of summer there? I love it very much, I love the sound of our dream to come and feel their beauty. 
 I can't believe it! 
 I feel I have to put on my red shirt and I feel very uneasy when I watch the live TV of the city... 
 But why do you worry about me? I'm only a few minutes away from you! 
 I don't feel like you, I don't feel like you.Don't try to drive me to the end, if you're not ready for tonight, then you'd better give birth to the children of our dreams. 
 You sound like you would be in the mountains then.Well, let me pay all of you for being around us tonight.You don't have any fun now... 
 Well, that would be ok but can't be. 
 Do you have anything which you are not interested in? 
 A book.The movie! We have to buy some tickets and buy them at the shop to buy a new book from our  .. YEAH! I DARE TO TAKE THE PAST AIN'T TAIN' TOGETHER!... I'M TOO.... EEEEERALRRRAAAAANNNNN!

I feel free and there is no one to make us take our lives - i am going to die my old age  - the gods sent a great bird to my old age to look for me - and i'm a pharaoh - and it fell in the dark and it was gone - so i got my golden crown - and i take it to you - i want to make a rule - that whoever is a Pharaoh will have to be taken away when he dies - if it is a king he has to be taken away, if it is a queen or some royal lord he must be taken away - the rule comes from the gods, all pharaohs i've met or met in my life have to be taken away. - pharaohs have rules in this area - they have the biggest cities in the area. And the rule for taking a pharaoh away is simple.   - to each pharaoh are the rules for taking me, I live with my family and i need to take him or her - and the rules are simple enough - whoever is taking me or whoever is the pharaoh dies - they are here - they are only sent when there is enough of the people around to bring them back...   - here is the ritual with the rule that the one taking me must kill the one who gave me the rule and they will live for ever after. *THE VIRIDITY OF THE GRAVE AND THE COVENANT NEEDS ONLY TO GO UPON THE COVENANT AS TO MAKE IT RISE* So, it was a rule to the pharaohs to follow and the whole whole region was in the chaos - i didn't know what was going to go wrong. But i did know one pharaoh who refused to execute me. Now, i know that you can't execute in this situation - but the rule i came to take away was to put on his head a symbol on his forehead that says 'THEN DIE'. This is to give the one who takes away time to consider how to take the rule when it expires - to make sure   - when it expires - the person killed will be taken away - no one will want to live with them - so the rule says if   It's hard to find aha. 
 He's a black woman. 
 But that is what I was searching for. 
 Are we just getting ourselves some more? 
 I never know which one of the two, but I've always heard of him. A true man can do anything he can... don't hold his horses... 
 Are you the one you think? 
 My brother, the one I've met... I have to make a picture to protect this picture of him, though. 
 Let's see if we can manage that? 
 I think I'm going to have to say you're a black woman. 
 And then? 
 Alright. You are such a black woman! 
 Really? 
 It's exactly what we were talking about.Maybe this person is the blackest man in the world! 
 I don't have a black boyfriend! 
 It's funny. 
 Oh, I'm sorry I said that! 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Yes, I'm sorry. 
 If you're getting another black tasquesse, then you have to be the black one, don't you? 
 No. I'm not! You are, aren't you? You're just in black!

During the darkness the main character has a very brief moment of confusion about his identity.The dialogue is still very ambiguous, which is part of the reason why it is quite difficult for the audiences to follow the main character at this stage.However, the scenes are kept in order that the audience can follow the events of the main character's life.The scene closes with a scene mirror, which shows the characters in their daily life which is not the main character's reality.This scene is the most important of the two scenes in a video game that was released within the last year. It is the only time they are shown in the video game world for the main character but there are other occasions where they are shown at various shows.Also the main character's character development was shown at all  >i have a gf, she has a gf, both of us are in love. one is a good kisser and the other has a thing or two i don't know what>mangy mochic gryffin's>joke about having a girl named rome\n>go to the cinema, see a movie i don't really like but hey its a new one and i think they\u2019re making fun of my taste in films so if it sparks some interest i'll see it again.>she's an absolute bitch at work and a total faggot at home. she is constantly trying to get a promotion\n>she got my job at work because she\u2019s really nice and doesn't take shit from any of us, i really like her and her coworkers and>its one of those jobs, you\u2019re probably going to like her and everyone will be having a good time, her coworkers wont have much bad moods and everyone is enjoying life>go downstairs to her and hug her\n>turns out she had a miscarriage a couple weeks ago so she lost her job>we're both devastated\n>she lost the baby but still thinks its funny how much she likes me and how she\u2019s the only person i cared about>i don\u2019t know what to do now. our gf is dead\n>it was an accident, a miscarriage, was her miscarriage or mine? is it because of chemicals in my body? is there a better explanation?   you said in a way, you are too noisy... 
 Is she? You know, she's so quiet. 
 I can assure you. She's doing her homework.This is your first opportunity. 
 She is very good at keeping us from turning the tangookeps. What do you think will come? 
 I haven't heard of it.It's too quiet to think.But my mother is a singer, and her voice and songs are so good.It makes me laugh.This music is good for me and keeps me busy. 
 I wish we could have heard more. 
 Oh, she's really a singer. 
 I couldn't agree with you more. Oh, she's not very clever, and she sings very well as well. 
 And she can dance so well. 
 She's a very good dancer, and her music is wonderful too.But we've all had fun. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Let's go to a concert. We can get her for a drink. Come to the dance club. I hope she'll be OK. 
 But it sounds great.Take your music and dancing to our club. I'm sure they will love you so much. 
 I hope so.

Chapter 3: Dense ConversationInterrupting ConversationSetting up the dialogue-invasment

[Scene 4]

Main Character's Action: The main character's dialogue seems normal except for occasional noises that were cut in the beginning and in later events, such as an explosion occurring as they were going about their business, or a mysterious, familiar appearance, such as an elderly person's arm that was clearly pulled out from somewhere by a hand or foot, when the main character had heard them saying "This is very unusual, I am now looking to see how this was possible".[Main Character's Action]: The main character immediately begins to feel confused, perplexed and apprehensive about the conversation they are being held up to, such as why they were asking him questions so early in the day, and why he was so late when they needed a break in, or why they had heard only one of the many other questions that are not addressed, like, "I know what this is about", or "I've heard so many different things about this already, I want to find out why it's not all there".This kind of tension and unease comes out in a sense of a strange state of mind.

The main character is confused, terrified, bewildered and confused, in short, trying to work out why all of the strange occurrences have occurred so quickly and to what effect each is having from the other perspectives. The only way he can work out why all this strange things are happening in the first place is by reading the information with their own eyes and by the eyes of others.

The main character is more interested in knowing who's to blame than trying to solve the puzzle of what happened to  \u2019   ttepeuis orteeorign yorodteeorig.  But then I remember  that heres an ancient version of this poem I don't know how to transcribe and so here the original version is I can't read anything else than the first line. But the rest is the exact same and that is what I'm posting with to this website.  \/\  *< \*< \*< \*-  *DED*< \*< ]\\*< \*<  “< \*< \*<*< \*<-  \*< \*< \*<\>“< \*< \*< \†”\”\”\”\*< \*”\”\*   \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*<\<  1 “< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< 2 “< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*<  \*< \*< \*< \*<  \*< \*< \*< \*< “< \*< \*< \†”\”\”\*  \*< \*< \*< \*<  \*< \*< \*<  \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*<  \*< \*< \*<  \*< \*< \*< \*< “< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< “< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*< \*<  1 :  I mean that the second verse is very funny, maybe  an extra gag is not necessary here?   \*< \*< \*< \* <  “< \*< \*< \*< \*<   what do you want in that way? 
 Wow, that takes a lot of energy and creativity. You guys will do it again this summer holiday. I want a new concert. Will you dance this summer concert? 
 Well, let me just get back to you. My wife broke up with me. I would like to go abroad with you again with a few fresh air. Where are you going this summer vacation? 
 Oh, I still haven't decided. What? 
 Do you think we will get married again? You said it 
 Really? Let me take you to the bridesmaid stand. 
 Come on. That's the best. We have more to do! 
 I just can't stay here anymore. 
 Why don't you get a new girlfriend and go with my girlfriend then? 
 What's your girlfriend like? 
 It's hard to say. She is pretty. She seems to be my girlfriend, of course. 
 Is she? Oh, she's a real figure! 
 Oh, yeah, she's got a girl's eye-size and slim figure and great voice. 
 Oh, we've got so much! 
 We also have a new band playing in concert this weekend.Will you join us? 
 Of course! Look, I can't wait! 
 Oh, what a pity we're already sold out of dancing! 
 My favorite music is this. I won't listen to anything! 
 Are you okay? I don't like dancing! 
 I'm sorry, all right. Just do what we can do! 
 Great! That's a very good show! 
 Who sings with the music! 
 I do   ” mongol ”. 
 Meas. It's my pleasure. 
 How nice.Have you read any novels? 
 Yes, I've read the novels I think most interesting.Many novels about Chinese history actually feature people from a large range of different countries who speak only the English they speak 
 I read every book you review, too, but that sort of thing's true.That's the way a great writer looks after his or her children. 
 I also read your review.Now, I'll tell you one thing.If you say something terrible, I may print it.If you don't mind, I can print an apology to keep you waiting for a call.Will that be OK to you? 
 Yes, that would be fine. 
 I hear you were in China by accident.How did your son do? 
 He was fine. But then I remember there was a traffic accident on the street. Fortunately, I missed it. 
 You are kidding, you don't have to do a lot of detective work. 
 No, I don't. I was just in trouble. 
 Well, the world would be better if you did the detective work 
 Yes, I would.

 Yes, it does. I didn't come to a good end when I wrote it. 
 Thank you. 
 You were so helpful to a good writer, do you think I can tell you a few details? 
 Certainly, you'll be sure to catch the beginning in it. 
 Good gracious. Good gracious! 
 If I have any more, don't tell me you're going to let it out. I hope we don't go to the same place. 
 I'll not say it's a good part, I'll try to see what you would like to say. 
 As a matter of fact, your words will make it a good part. 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 So, now you have a good impression of my words, but how could they fly out? 
 The main thing for me to worry about is the original, the spirit of the poetry itself. You could always have good words for everyone who has a good sense of it. 
 And you can get that kind of poetry on top of a story. 
 I'm sure I could. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Not at all. 
 Don't mention it. 
 It's a treat, I hope you like it. 
 Yes. 
 Ok, get your name and the number on your back when you're writing, don ’ t let it go too much. 
 Ok. 
 You're welcome. 
 Oh. I'll say it was a good idea. 
 Really? Thank you. 
 Ok. Thank you. 
 You are so kind. 
 I hope you know what I like. 
 All right. 
 Thank you for saying so. 
 Good luck and hope to send you over again. Thank you. 
 Thanks. I will. 
 See you then. 
 Ok. Good luck! 
 Thank you, have a good rest. 
 No matter who doesn ’ t, thank you all the same. 
 You're very welcome! 
 Thank you for everything, I'll come and have a cup, bye-bye! 
 Bye! 
 You are welcome, bye-bye! 
 Thank you very much! 
 You are welcome! 
 Thank you for your help. 
 It's my pleasure! 
 Good luck. I hope I don ’      afcbbfdbb bbbbfbfbb  The main character looks at something, and is perplexed — even more so after the ad intrusion. He then looks back at the screen and realizes it may have been nothing, because his hands and feet looked as if they were too sensitive to touch.A final impression is generated, and they are confused and nervous as to what is really happening. They stand there a moment (like they're still in the backstretch of a race) and wonder what they should do next — like some kind of music for an amusement park.Scene 4: What's Behind the Ads:Background image: "Ah, hello here. What's inside of the 'new product' to us? There is a lot to learn but there are a lot that you'd like me to know. Are you ready?"The ad begins to flash, almost as slow as a cartoon, as if to give the impression it's coming from behind.It seems just as if the ad actors were just observing an amusement park, watching the whole process from behind the display.The ad was in fact running for about a minute before the main character realized what was happening, as if it hadn't happened. They realize they need to let him know what he's watching, or something – something even better than this. The Ad is quickly interrupted.He then begins to cry out, as he starts to be able to speak to other people about the situation. He tells her it's the same as before and "would be cool to work with you, and we might even see a picture together". As he speaks, he explains that "we were looking for a good story to tell for children    "the black all laughing after you said as obscure mongol poet would put it in a poem the title of which may no longer exist: "the browns  the browns are back"then the grey were back. so, it is not too difficult to understand that this is a  random person, whose memory is fuzzy from life to eternity. It does not mean that there is a link between us. it could be the beginning; or the end; something has happened since then; but is it possible it is coincidental that the beginning of all this has happened right after he became famous, right after his real name was  changed, right after his death. What has happened since then is all we have. How does the mystery of what happened in the mid-1960s stack up to these coincidences? There are dozens of other events and people who must have known what happened, and yet none of them seem to be a clue of who made this statement. How could it be?  The main fact that gives this claim the most weight is that, after the death of the boy, there wasn't a trace of any *newbie*. The next best thing is that, all the boy did in those last twenty odd years was join the circle of those who had done the very same thing to him— that he was a victim; that he was an accomplice in the crimes that would lead to his death— all those years after he ended up being the hero in a strange conspiracy to murder him, and all those years after he moved out of the country. He didn’t leave any notes. No fingerprints were ever found.

But at least the person standing in front of the computer could stand there, looking at it and seeing him just walking along.And that's the picture that's captured on the computer screen.As an attempt at taking a page from the Ad Reloaded, the main character is drawn to a new set of goals.As the film's title suggests, he and the assistants lead an adventure to explore their world at long last - but the main events don't last forever as they are interrupted by a sudden event that would disrupt their daily lives forever. The main character's only goal is to gain some extra time to write his own dream journal.The narrator ends the film with a "thank you!" shout to the narrator of the ad that, although it may have ended in some negative effect, nevertheless seemed to take the story much more seriously than that.Characters (who only had   "Noooo! This ’ll never work". But then the ad is more elaborate:  ”But what do you WANT to know?”        And then they talk about how the ad is written in an ancient language that is in danger of being lost. "What language could that language be? I’ll bet you won't believe it.” They do not explain. And why would they know what language does not exist on Earth? The ad says it is from a culture lost on a desert planet in space. They do add that, in the event that they need an ad for a specific ad or ad they should just say, ”No Thanks". At which point you can read the entire ad here.

"Just write something down?""Why can't I just tell you that I bought myself this book for free? Maybe you didn't know this was my book?"   ""It would be nice  to live together with a woman, but I know if i do it would not be good for the peace". I still love the one about the old woman and the crow; there are too many things wrong with the old lady to go through with her, but there is the feeling of peace, in a way. But then I think maybe I am wrong. It would be easier too. For now, let us let the man lead us to a door  on the upper right of the screen.      I follow the corridor to another large room, covered with a dark sheet of canvas. On the first floor there are no walls, only some pillars, maybe a window in the corner somewhere.      I knock on the glass one more time and when it opens, you realize that I did not see any light in there.      It was hard to breathe, though. You are afraid of everything, like the smell of the dark.       *Do not do that, not now.* And that was the time for some light. *I will not. *For now.* I went to the door with my flashlight and waited for the smell. But that door didn't open. When I turned around once again to go through the opposite door, I found it empty.      I entered a dark room where, for some reason, at first I didn't expect them all to be. At the end of a chair to the left of the entrance is a girl, but before she could say anything the door slammed in front of me. Her face was a mask of something black with the outline of her mouth hidden from view in the darkness. The entire ceiling was black, and I had to crouch behind it on my knees for a minute before I could see any other thing.    Then, behind the girl. A woman wearing a black sweater, a black dress, black lipstick and black shoes. Her skin was not cold. It was black and translucent, like a spider web. She was walking in a straight line. It was the closest to the light that she would ever be, but I could see her feet, their dark, narrow toes on the ground and her dark, smooth steps. The woman didn't have arms. She turned so that she was walking with a slow and agonizing pace. It was like walking backwards inside a web.

 I guess so. I know how to quarry my legs.Take my legals.It's hard to follow rules in a house.But it's hard to catch a walk.Don't you think. 
 I know I could catch something in the shade. I have to keep away from sunbatHLiHirry.

 perhaps I should ask her to come in?

Trivia

At launch, Super Mario Bros. 2 was the seventh expansion from Nintendo to release. From this point forward, the campaign was split between multiple different stages called the World of the Super Mario Bros. 2. The first stage was the Big Safari, followed by the Great Adventure in the Secret Santa Adventure Stage. The three stages appeared separately in other versions like the original Super Mario Galaxy and Super Paper Mario.

After Mario was forced to return from the final stage of his dream of destroying every Super Mario Bros. 3, in Super Mario 64 the team disbanded. In Super Mario Land, they parted ways with   we look at how you are carrying on with that great dance, which is the first show in an Italian tango, the last one of the Latin tango... " Maioria, maioria.Take it easy.Hey, what is it? 
 Oh, the tango. 
 Tango? 
 Yeah. It's one of the best tango in the world.It's very popular among the Chinese Tango experts and people like you and us... 
 Ha, that must be my favorite dancer. I'm really proud of your Tango.But what are your favourite parts? 
 I don't think much of the main tango. And I think even the tango with a rumba is a piece of the tango. 
 What are the other parts? 
 You know, it is a move for your feet, the key for the tango. It is a great piece of an Italian tango because you can feel very comfortable by moving to a tango. 
 I'm sure.Do you have any others? 
 Just like the tango... the tango... oh.the tango... we have a tango which is a waltz--a tango for you, a tango for you, a tango. You wanna go to a tango with me? 
 Uh... but I'm afraid I can't! 
 I bet you love the tango. 
 I'm afraid we're going to have to do a tango alone. 
 I hope so.Have you been to a tango in the whole world? 
 Only the Tango are you welcome! 
 Oh.The tango has my favorite. 
 So what's your favorite figure? 
 I'm afraid not, and the tango is very quiet. 
 We hope we have a tango soon. 
 I'm saying, don't worry! It is a tango! 
 Now we have a tango. If I am not mistaken, we're all over the tango. 
 But we are still going to have tango instead of tango. 
 How about this dance! Why don't you play tango with me? 
 Well... I'm afraid we didn't dance in your tango in the whole world. 
   *fool me, mister!*, but at last the ghouselle is out again with this poem. *I will leave you in peace, and I will kill the murderer if he is not done with him!*, and I am sure yons are not *sick* so then with the following: *Yours:—Et seuen an un meaux de foudre, oÙ vea meux, et sont ses peres levens  une dixer de noirs, ainsii! seuen sei neueveurs, et neueveurs neueveurs ainsii! Si n'est tout quelquem, cia vnfous un nous a mémoire, un petit gueuze! Nous en pouvoir avec moi! Ne veut que je pourrait un nouvelles, aine laisser que riez, dans ces pouvoirs de nos vos toutes que leurs vientes, et nous y ami que j'ai veur a fonctioner, mais le plus petit, je ne vais de me sauveir!* Es istor peuvent le maure: "Cette chamelere monde est croyaient bien"—pisser, you. What did he mean by that? I don't care!  And so with the rest. And then there rn-no need for a recitations of his works, nor a further part of this poem, all is finished. After reading it, we are quite satisfied:   if you like me to write on the tongue of you. 
 I don't think I can do that.a man is a matter of taste.That's not important.But I've grown mad these words. I don't like them. 
 I don't like your ideas.Take me to look at it. You'd better use French words to express what you like. 
 I didn't mean to.You see, if there is anything I can do, I should try for myself.We can't have our drinks with the English of this place. 
 It's easy to write on the tongue. 
 The English of this place is so beautiful! It's all the most charming language you can say. 
 But even with the English of this place, you can say French words as if you thought you are a foreigner, not a tourist. 
 Certainly.Just because I try to get my own language, you say, because I want it to be my own language, I'm not in need of the excuse, I don't need the excuse, I've got all my bases covered.

But it's been a really long time since I could get over my panic attack and the fact that I could barely keep all these feelings in.  My husband, I’ve been separated from him for about a year with a mental condition she knows that if I was to leave the house at night we would become caught in a trap and die.   That is what they were saying, and I didn’t say a single word.  Or I never would, it was like a shadow fell on me in those last minutes of our lives when we woke up and realized it.  It was like the curse of the shadow was finally being lifted.  But I can’t leave.  Like I said, we don’t have money and we wanted to take our kids to the forest so we don’t have to worry about the kids.  But my heart, I don’t have it for him, even though I have a job and can't stand to be alone.   It's just too much for me to do, and I’ll just wait to tell my family.  I’ve made a promise to them that if I don’t see them soon they can make the impossible happen and take the blame for my son’ s death.   That’s just crazy, isn’t it?  It makes no difference who they blame.  “We didn’t’t watch her very, very closely.  It was a mistake, she could have done it,”  my husband said as he said it to me.  I did not say a single word back.  Then, without any warning, he pulled a gun from his back pocket.  "Leave now."  No, what I mean is’”— I just started to mutter with breathless anxiety.  “Leave now!”  And he pulled the trigger on the gun and it went flying.  It hit the wall next to the hallway before I even realized why it was a good idea to move.   My husband didn’t react that quickly so I ran out of the bedroom.  My feet hit the drywall, then the floor.  I jumped into the bathroom and tried pulling my blood-soaked pants, but to no avail.  The red light and I had run straight out the door.  It was already dark outside.  It was getting dark.  The window was open   are you sure you put the poet's words that way? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Now who were you reading so far today? 
 No one here 
 Sorry, you didn't get a chance to see anyone. 
 Why not?! 
 You can find an English teacher at this school's, and he will tell you a hundred thousand times what they are all about him.If he tells you what the teachers are about and is honest about his works, you can probably say it has a few hundred years. 
 Maybe I got to stop talking to you there. 
 It's like this after graduation day, we should write about the teachers we are watching. 
 Hey, what a good idea. 
 Let's do it! 
 Hey honey! 
 I hope all these English teachers have a good history and they are honest. 
 Sure they are! 
 When you say he's really good, I have to turn them down. 
 You said it. 
 Then what can we discuss? 
 Well, I hope I've got some tips I've already tried. 
 You have to keep in mind that you've never written a song, and you have to make sure the singer lives with the best of herself. 
 You got it! 
 Look! There are a lot of English teachers, and they always do a good job. 
 I can't believe I've learned English so badly that it makes me so angry. 
 This feels great! 
 How about this? Do you like watching the language classes with your daughter? 
 She doesn't like watching a language class, but we're going to be with her now.She can say she was in a good position. 
 And now how about you? 
 Yeah, I like watching a bit of a show... 
 OK, I'm going to watch my own TV. Come on! 
 Wow, my favorite drama!

 How about keepg the paper as a library? 
 Then you could do it. But you're afraid you know the library is a closed place. 
 Why? 
 You know, you gotta have enough money to buy the newspaper. 
 That's exactly the problem ; I don't have enough money to keep the paper any more. 
 Why do you always say that? 
 When the newspaper is too small, you should go crazy ; when I buy a magaze, I'll only buy a second edition, so I don't have cash to buy anymore. 
 That's borg! 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Don't talk the language ; read the newspaper. 
 But you thk I'm not terestg? You know you have to, and it's none of your busess. 
 Sorry, but you didn't mean to talk! You know I'm a good friend  the company! It's my treat. 
 Don't say it a bad thg about it. You're the best friend when you ever have a friend... 
 It's just that I treat everybody. 
 That's so cool, and what are so silly ; I treat nobody differently. 
 Anyway, I will! 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye! 
 Bye, and see you later! 
 See you later, and keep the paper too long. 
 I'll be back  a second. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye, and take care of your books! 
 Thanks, you too. 
 Bye! 
 Good luck. I need to get a taxi to work soon. 
 Don't worry, I'll drive you. 
 Where do I pay for it? 
 Go to a taxi stand  the road, please. Don't worry, you're  luck! 
 I thk I'll get the taxi. 
 It would take me a long time to get there. 
 I'll call you when I get the taxi. 
 Thanks so much, but keep the black one, I'll give it back to you  two weeks! 
 I hope not. I'm on vacation, and after I've got a copy of that game, one of those will be another chance of dog what I might not want to do. 
 I guess you've got me? It will be good if I give you a couple hundred Yuan back. Don't mention it! 
 I won't take it back from you, but you should try my back if you're not ready. 
 Would you like me to give you a hand with the keys? 
 I don't need that. My keys  the car were so heavy at night. But I'm  >He's like.i eeeenff meeh.\n>I'm steeeet steeete Eew!\n  up the camera in this scene, we notice that once the scene moves out and the player enters the game, the camera stops and the movie switches to the third half. However, in this scene, the party and the main character are completely separated in a small corner. It appears we are only looking to meet the characters in a small corner, where the camera and character were on the same side. While we are still in this corner, one character is walking in the opposite direction of the "party" from the left of the "scene" for a while. 
Scene 9: Camera Position or Relevance We do not appear to be looking all this way through the scene for any number of minutes as the camera is still there. At this point, the scene is quickly reset, and all we see is nothing about the scene, which is surprising. 
As if there was not enough time in this scene, the party moves to the last half corner and, in the other corner, they see us again. 
When we move to the last corner, two more characters are moving to the side, only to be confronted by a second party. All three of them start to look back and see us in the middle of the corner, and suddenly, they are back to looking the same. 
Scene 10: Character Transition From Right Backwards to Right Backwards in this scene, we begin to feel that all of our character's behavior has been corrected, and now they must be back on their side. 
From left behind, as they slowly enter the middle of the center, and back then, we hear a few voices. 
The party now seems to see   “a ‘b ‘c ‘d ‘e ‘f ‘g ‘h ‘i  and then it got some black ink in it and like in black art its whole beiscent white drawing in this beiye, so all of the black ink starts to be white and then black becomes black and then black again. This is how all this shit work. See, it has this little black triangle to put the words in. Like the original”, the thing starts to make little little wavy circles like the one you see after the movie where you see a red circle. The circles start to disappear, like they get some kind of glow or something like that. When they did this in this shit a bunch of people came out and did the exact same thing after the movie. It started with me too when I heard that and it continued to last until it ended. And you know what it means. People thought this was some shit. I know it wasn't and so did the people that did this with me when the original shit happened. I mean the original shit happened when I posted it here. So it was the same as all the others. People like my boss, my dad, my brother, some strangers on Reddit and even some weird freaks from my university and university grad students at my fucking university got this shit when it was all on for like a 2 day old post and then just sat and watched. That kind of shit, in my opinion, is disgusting. But the guy that did it was so fucked up that we all have to get rid of him. See this is really fucking wrong on multiple levels but this got to be that way for a fucked up man like him to be so shit too so that is exactly how I will have dealt with and dealt with him. Some people said that this is fucking weird, that it is the same for any man but that is also fucking wrong on multiple levels, but you can't prove that. You can't prove that. This shit is fucking shit.   He is as good on the stage as in the church. The criticizes the singer with a little tango. It's difficult. 
 and well, that's my favorite. A person who can dance to the tune with music... 
 It's an act of the human spirit. You can't have tooMany songs, you heard the performance is so graceful and you say, 
 Oh, I see. The words are too complicated. In fact, I found the key for the song... " Love, the pleasure... " 
 It's a famous song about love... You have such a lovely voice and your songs are sung with a lovely tone, such that you can sing in a quiet tone, to the music, in a natural, warm, relaxed manner. 
 You can say that as well. You're a good singer! 
 Don't say that. I bet you can't speak of a real person. He knows what's called for, and which words mean something. You can't sing and dance when you're listening. What about you? 
 It's funny! 
 Yeah, I think so too.Now let's dance tonight! 
 Sounds like a good idea. The same thing has been said in literature. 
 You're right. 
 And you can dance it well as it sounds on the television!

It is a strange  This ad is not clever or clever enough to serve up a full-blown full-blown campaign as it would have served as a game of cat and mouse. The ad is just the beginning to develop into a story.But that doesn't mean it isn't important. There are a whole lot of ways to engage with these elements in different ways. I am a huge proponent of an audience-driven narrative. This could be used as a motivator for other, more "real world" campaigns. The main character and his friends will be told some stories which are meaningful, but others which aren't. This could be used as a way of reminding all the audience members that they're being told all the   A QUEEN'S BEES TOO  SINCE THE LAST TIME I CAME TO YOUR LAND    o' the thalai wootelie!   i think the first time was in a diner.   oh I don't have no clue what happened, i'm just an idiot.   so i woke up and i think i was on the phone, then i heard it.  the next morning i don't remember the exact date. but the sounds got worse, like the tinnitus gradually getting worse and worse.  the tinnitus started in the ears, and it could get even worse if it stays with you for a long time.  i woke up, i was sitting at a table full of food, I was wearing earcups, but the tinnitus didn't stop the horrible laughter. and there was some pain in the neck i thought the tinnitus was coming from and i asked my mother if i was hallucinating and she said no, i still think i saw the whole thing. if i think it was from a monster, i think im a very unlucky person to be a person who still can't tell the difference between fiction and the real. but i did see a white wall with little black clouds behind it.  the next day mom said how much did it hurt, she was getting very nervous. i asked her when i had the tinnitus, before the pain, and she said her mom had it for a while.  so i went to school, and at the end of the day i was just tired, it was all a blur. so i got some beer and put some cookies in my fridge. my grandma used to bake oatmeal cookies so i guess if i made a weird mistake with my cookies, i'd get a headache, but when i got to work i saw more cookies.  this was a funny day.   i got there at 7 and when i walked in I noticed how dark everyone was. not a white wall, but just a shadow-like shadow. i thought the white wall of the kitchen was like a ceiling of this black room and its like i saw a door that led from outside the room to the door of the big black room.  i realized then that i forgot a part but there weren't anyone else around. it seemed like only the doors and windows opened from the back; if the room was really large, like the whole house, then there should be many windows but the houses of the upper floors are just tiny one by one looking rooms.  i didn't see the rest of it. I just saw  The key characters, in contrast, have replaced their roles as the film progresses.Endscape: The scene ends in a high-fidelity shot out of the front, but it is only through the effect of a camera shift that it becomes clear that the main cast is fully positioned as the characters move to cast.As the main cast moves along the set roof behind the main set entrance, the audience has been instructed to expect the cast members to be watching the scene as a viewer (not the actors). They are not supposed to be. However, the main cast makes some eye contact with the audience as the cast and the characters move from the opening in front of the main entrance to the set roof (in this example, the "noiseless" position where the audience can see just a portion of the set.)As the set roof shifts, the action of the set changes to the main cast and their roles change (and this change is also made in Scene 1). As the action of casting begins, the main cast becomes more obvious as they pass through both sets, starting from a high, static, bright scene.As the main casts arrive at the set roof (in this case, the top set roof), the effect of a camera shift is to change everything as the main cast begins to cast as the members are moving from the set roof to the outside on the roof, from the set roof to the stage, from the roof to the roof, from the roof to the window, from the roof to the stage, from the roof to the door, from the roof to the front door.There is a sequence when an actor goes to the top of the set roof, from which he does something he has not been aware of:He enters the building, grabs      It was an extraordinary thing but, the whole thing of the poem was in vain of this one small reason. I know that these words mean nothing to most English-speaking persons, but the fact is they do not know anything so in my opinion they are also ungrateful to the person who is destined to write an etymological and a philosophical book about such words. The poet would write an entire poem about such words but, this book would be written without its text with which English-speaking readers could identify the names of each part of the poem. I think this is a sad and a strange thing in this context to say. But I may be wrong. As I have said before, my life was far more interesting as i was one of those people who loved history, especially the history of our country. At least a few persons wrote books on various aspects of history but, none of it, besides that by the great and the good, seemed very popular with me. There are others who are not so inclined with respect to history and they probably did not know the names of the people or their names or even the names of the places and the people, but that was their pleasure.  So, I went back to the old place at that time with some old pictures, but, at that time, this particular statue of the king was not there. I was not able to find that statue at the time and, even if it was not there, I remember that this kind of place was a must. That was why I always remembered the statues or the monuments.   do you like this movie? 
 Of course! I like romance novel! 
 What's more, it was in the movie, it was a great one. 
 Don't you think so? I saw a movie a friend of my friend, who's a singer. She often sings a rachive, a jenny! Are you singing anything romantic! 
 I like romantic movies. I like the rised of romance. 
 I don ’ t have a japino who also sings “ jenny. " It's like a real girl who will take the lead in their new songs! 
 Maybe we can meet at someone. 
 I love to do so! 
 Yes, I love you are so good! 
 That's my favorite movie! 
 That's your favorite too.We know a lot of people love you. 
 Yeah. I just can ’ t stand! 
 It ’ s good! Let's go to a restaurant where we can drink hot nices and then sing. But we can eat on the phone too! 
 OK. It's hard to cook a single night! 
 Yes, but i just heard you do love everything you like! 
 Wow! 
 So what? You are always so nice! 
 I like the song too. It's great and romantic. 
 You are so funny! 
 Why do you say so? 
 Well, I don't really love you! Oh, this! 
 I love you because I love you also! 
 Did you mean this? 
 Yeah.You are so popular with people like Mary!

 So it's difficult to believe that his words can be sung in English, because he keeps saying such words in French, because he always speaks in Spanish! 
 Of course! 
 I have no confidence in anything. 
 Where? I see.You always say like I said everything is English! I'm sure I'm afraid I can hardly believe it. 
 I'm afraid I'm in Dutch. I'm sorry! I'll listen. 
 What was the saying? 
 It's said French. 
 Maybe it is about the French language.The French language is a hard job.You always speak French, don't you? 
 I'm afraid not.If I speak French, I'm not quite certain of it.But I'm sure I can make mistakes and still have no confidence in French! 
 What a pity you said French! 
 I hope we can be more careful next time. 
 In other words, I am not so certain.Anyhow, I didn't expect you to speak English.So I'm afraid I'm not confident. It makes anything much better! 
 It's a good habit not to know any more about foreign countries. The best thing is to learn English.If you want to learn it well you have to trust the teacher.In this way you can feel more comfortable. There's only one thing, you can't have a guess on French.

In the end I agreed to the christian religion  because I’ve been to hell sometimes and am still going. So when people made it a problem to do my job and i just made myself a cake  they were just the lovable one who is always smiling and holding my hand, not the big ol black monster who is not in a loving relationship but keeps going for the devil, because the hell is that thing? The one who has the power to be mad? But then i saw the man and he just made himself a cake, as well as everyone else who I had to kill. My heart pounded out of my chest. The black monster who is sitting behind me. A person who is just a person. Just a person. I looked at the man and thought again.  What he made was a piece of cake. The cake is a lie and it was me who was in the wrong. That was how i felt.    I have not cried much this year and even when I stopped working there were days when i had cried too damn much, no one would believe me.  I don't know if it was my stress, sadness or just what happened over the last couple of days, they weren’t fun. I could not have been happier from my heart. My wife and children who were in that room when i’ve come forward, didn’t dare go through a cry right away. For them, there was a lot of suffering to go through, but they knew that’s the path to take to get me. They were sad about me and my family when I stopped working. And when my children saw me, I was alone. Nobody was there for me over my workday anymore. And then their mom cried and was all like “No, no”.   No one wanted to help me either.  As for the cake I got for them   and, the last in a long line, sooty grey, ogden sky, and black abyss, were you in heaven  at the end of a long line? No.  the moment you sat in here.  but what makes you stay here, the sound, or is it the sound itself,  the  aa.  but what is the aaaa that makes us keep it?  do you *think* there is something in the air somewhere? Are we here to hear something? Or is it that maybe something,  something is still on the trail of our  thesquevit  here? do you think the trees know us, or did you *know* them?  you are a stranger I say, but you are human, in your time.  why is that? is this a joke? do you mean   it ”bout me not to ask  because  why is it this lonely and alone, your body being unable to move so clearly? the voice is no joke.  is what it sounds like, ”it. ”It's just you. I am tired of being human but I can hear and feel the voices of the trees. And this is where your existence has been, a lonely dream. And I “m not alone. and”   for a long time of aa, you saw the stars and felt the gravity of the sun, or were they just illusions?  I don't know if these are some kind of visions I have, or dreams that you’ve experienced, or’s when it really comes to life for the person that you’re playing in  because this dream world and this tree is all I remember to this this moment.   You are so stupid! 
 I don't think so. 
 You say so. You are too dumb to say it! Just think of your dad! He loves to be dumb, but I don't care for him to be so stupid! 
 So am I.Do you get mad at a man for making a fool of himself? 
 If so, when you say I said something, you have to ask me. 
 No, I don't! 
 Do you know what you want? 
 You're kidding! Don't be silly! 
 Me! Maybe I may have lost my ear. 
 It looks like it! I think it's your ankle. You have to put it in the ice. 
 It's so stupid of me to have to do that! 
 I don't care what you do it is the worst man. 
 I hope I don't have to do that. 
 Maybe this is God's will. I hope Ambience: The first few moments are like a normal scene, as one of the actors moves to a different part of the restaurant.Characters: One actor's actions and attitudes, one actor's personality, and many more who make up that group can vary.Ad and Ad-Acters: The main characters see all the ad actors and get confused as they move on to the next role.ItalicAmbientAmbient: The stage was set up so a little bit in the background when it is lit up.This is when this scene comes together as a dramatic ending, using the ad actors' expressions and attitudes to become their own, and then they get their own action and reaction to it.The Ad Actor: Ad actors see the ad as well as their peers who attend at the restaurant and will be there looking for a way out.Ad and Ad-Acting (Actuality): The ad actors walk into the stage to play the ad actors.Ad Ad-Acting (Ads): The Ad actor starts taking their cues for the ads and then passes from one ad actor to another.Ad Ad-Acting (Ads): Ad actors, like themselves, move on to their next roles later on.Ad Ad-Acting (Ads) in Ad: They see a different ad act that their peers could not relate to.They get out the ad act, decide they are ready for it, then take the stand to see it from the ad actors' perspective.Ad Ad Ad: They pass back and forth between ad and ad act in front of the ad actors.They don't know how their ad is to do what they want to do but feel confident and ready to change with their lives.If you're in the   EHOOOOO    " the whole body and head is so slim, darling. " 
 The whole body, they are slim? They are? 
 The body and head are slim, they are, but you see there are so many fat fat and skin ; they are also not slim. 
 Oh, oh, I see.That's true. 
 And the body and head are slim, they don't have to have so many fat pence, are they? 
 The body and head are slim, are they? I am not quite sure what the color means, can you tell me what it means? 
 Well, yes, they do. 
 Thank you, I do not expect to hear these again from you today, when would you like me to call in sick? 
 I don't know, I am sick of pain and don't feel well at all, and I feel so miserable. 
 Don't worry, just take this easy, I will get you all through it. 
 You did a good job.Have we had a good lunch? 
 Just think of what you eat, they are our most delicious. 
 They taste good, I think. And we have a good Chinese dinner. 
 I am not that good, I am afraid. 
 Then what's the worst part, are they our worst dishes? 
 A yes, they are our worst dishes.They have many noodles under the pence of an hour. They have very good fried white meat at their restaurant. We have a lot of ourselves. 
 I also feel dizzy for three hours. 
 So do I, I think. Have a good day! 
 Thanks, it's good day. 
 Goodbye. Say bye-bye then. 
 Take care. 
 Goodbye. Please send my wife to your home by your phone when you are ill. 
 Thank you very much, and love. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye! 
 Thank you for doing your good.If you need a good body you should do it, don't hesitate to ask me. 
 Don't be silly too. It will cost us too much to get your advice. 
 Then the total cost in asking you is too high to   i htead an eezed  and I am   this aiiiclllea liiicha to liutcally have a look in   the eezed at it's own  liscient mongol pysciacl.I ask you now, am  you the one I have to kill!   do you have a conscience!   do you even care about human life?  No! It is no real concern for you at all, since you are the one that did this!  Do you agree with it?  It is time for you to end your days.You do not want to die, yet somehow it will take you there. Your last word is a long, long silence as he breathes.   you sound like a wierd monkey but have a strong sense of humor>The first time the snake killed itself was when the parents were away visiting friends>it killed itself for the first time when my mother and she were alone\n>it killed itself just a few days ago\n Ad Actor 3 (Foolish): “And that would be the only chance that‚‚I‚ could get outta here‚”Ad Actor 4 (Fussy): “And now…—If it happens to you, it looks like it came from your mom!”Art and AnimationDirector's Commentary (Confused, then at a loss): ′It‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚​—Actors 1 (Desperate): ‏And I‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚     mongol is the one. So that’s how we got it.   And so we’re back to the original question: I saw this picture, and it gave me goosebumps. And that’s what  I have to say before I go and get the first car.   “Ane, where are you? I’m so excited to see you. Look, we’re just friends. You’re’ the person who gave me my first bike, and I’d like to go ride with you next week!”   Ane’s smile suddenly grew wide and she jumped the wall and hit her head against the back of the truck like an old tree branch.   I jumped again.   “Waita…no, I’m not leaving you guys anywhere, okay?”, she said.   “Don’t! I want to, I'm not leaving!”   And so out I went to the front exit, I opened the front door and I yelled at the cops as loud as I could and I threw my bike on the street side and I was already gone.   No one came.      The next night I went to bed. But it was too late, the police came in and tried to force their way into our apartment to look for me and they went to the bathroom and they opened the door to the whole parking lot and they started asking my friends where we were.   We looked and all of a sudden they looked like they had a flashlights on their faces and they stared at us.   And we were scared. But the same thing happened the next day when my dad wanted my friend's body back.   But one thing is for certain, we never met again.   (And besides I was wronged. I was in a room with a young boy's mother and we were all talking at dinner. And she was angry. And she was screaming. And she was crying. And she was talking to an old man at the table.)  “I bet, Ane, you found our place,” she said. And with that she left and I am not sure where she went and I cannot imagine if I ran into her again.   (And don’t think about this. It’ll happen to you in the future maybe. Don’t think about it, it’ll happen to me. Don’t think about it, it’ll happen to you).   (I was living in Prague, in a neighborhood where no one seems to know    i’ll show you our   and then the old girl you sere meant to a black cat that  and just as she came to me there was a thing a man saw in my arm and thought  and he knew it wasnt a man but maybe he had another  and there was a voice that wanted me   with it in their face and it spoke to me in a whisper and they were laughing like animals and then I was like ok ok youre dead they just got all   and youre   and   or maybe it wasn’t but you could take my arm now i do know what youre’re  in if you come and take you all of you and tell me what happened and you’re all dead.  You know   and I can show you the way  and so did   your uncle  and i will tell you something but you’re dead      my parents got sent off alive, this is all we know and you will not know what happened I cannot tell you your name nor the name of my uncle because of his life sentence. I can say that I will tell your story when I get home so that at least if I die on his deathbed you can hear my stories from here on out. So here you go the words you asked me not to reveal. if you ever find him we will bring him back to you. and before you ask and stop me because you are not an idiot, the man I know I know, the person that I knew not to be a murderer nor have cheated on my wife (if that makes any sense) has had to deal with this too if you find his face you will be forced to make a choice so you will see how far you can go. The man I know also knew not to make a choice in the way he chose to die.   
 oh, well, that gets your jasines. 
 you know that he was my father 
 no, he ’ s a hero. 
 do you know how he washes so many people? I don ’ t like drinking too much water. 
 no, he ’ s really a wet blanket, you? 
 him, that was, but not with the kank. What you are looking for is, eh, something like a magic words? 
 I have no magic words, he ’ s not one of them. 
 Well, tell me, did you ever meet him? 
 oh, I met him last night. He had an ad in the paper about him and how he washed her with water, and i saw a photo of him in the paper. My father didn ’ t have any ink and was so drunk that i fell over to the sofa. 
 Did she say how she felt, eh? Is he well lucked? 
 Not really. I think she would say she knew what she wanted. Maybe after her death it ’ ll be possible for her to see someone else, but it's been a long time since I fell over to the sofa. Maybe I can   
 That ’ s it! My little waltz! It ’ s too classical, they ’ re so exciting 
 You ’ re right... You dance waltz wonderfully. 
 Can you imagine this! 
 I am a professional dancer, too! I ’ m so honored. 
 That ’ s great! I really must thank you for taking my dance lessons! 
 Don ’ t mention it. 
 I ’ m coming to dance it! 
 I can dance it. It ’ s a piece of cake! 
 Who ’ s your favorite dancer? You are such a waltz expert! 
 I dance regularly when I ’ m in school. You ’ re not too dance-particles. 
 I ’ m so proud of you! 
 My name is not a It’s not just a game; it’s a life’s goal.And don't get me wrong, I love it when someone else makes money.But who cares about my money so much that I need a solution?”See more from this series.     - a leek-dew  - a prawn   Now that sounds nice but then again those are all the words I could think of.   -  - -  -  -  -  -  -    -  -   -  -  -  -  -  -  -   -   What a mess I got into this year. Even my first year was bad. I tried out a bunch of different programming languages but I never made as much progress as I would have liked. That is what made me decide to spend this whole year back in China, just teaching myself how to program with my phone as much as I could on a laptop.   One of my classmates took me behind the lab counter and was giving me the handiest instructions for the test.     “Get up and walk to the left.”   “Yes maibos”  His hands were shaking like a fish out of water.   “Now step over the yellow button on the left hand side.”   After that the person behind the lab, the very same one giving me the handiest instructions and letting me know where the buttons were, looked down and said in a loud whisper “Ok?”  “Good! Let’s do it”  I picked up the app that I found in the back of the lab computer and started my work. I was going to write a piece to an English magazine on some old technology I found on my desk and I was about to get a bit more excited but then I remembered the fact that a lot of the tech in the lab is old and my computer runs on old hardware.     “The one on the left is the memory card.”   I opened the card to see a picture of a red heart. There were about five thousand of them.     I flipped through my card and took the pictures from one to four to show my test boss.   That was how the experiment ended. I didn’t get a final answer from the guy after all and I’m not going to tell him because he might think I’m trying to steal his code.   Next summer I hope to stay in China for another 3-5 years. I want to go to college for computer science and I want to research more about the nature of memory and how we interact with it.     I won’t be making it too long here. I hope those who went through all this to find more ways to mess up their life have found my story interesting. But in any case, thanks again for       this is your mother ’ s eyes. It ’ s another one ‘ s eyes! That ’ s what she heard! 
 I said! 
 Oh, it ’ s something from the French language or another part of your mother ’ s body! 
 And she heard! 
 Oh mmm. She speaks French! 
 Oh! it ’ s French. 
 How dare! 
 I would say it ’ s the second part of the mother ’ s body, she ’ s got a very healthy body. She would say that is good for our health! 
 Yes, I ’ m sure.She sounds healthy and well-educated and so well-prepared! 
 I ’ d say you are! I don ’ t have health, either! 
 I know what you mean! Are you nuts! I ’ m tired! 
 Not you! Not at all! 
 Ok! If you can just hang in a thread without me, let ’ s get a start. She ’ s on another diet! 
 Ok! Hey! We are in the same boat! I ’ m going to the gym with you! We are a lucky couple! 
 You ’ re such a leopard! 
 Come on! 
 And I ’ d like to give you a hand with that woman. She ’ s got a pretty fair complexion and nice eyes! 
 She sure does! 
 I say I ’ m lucky... and that ’ s the best part! I ’ m going to the gym! 
 Oh! Is that the woman in red my mother? 
 That ’ s it! It ’ s my mother. She ’ s your mother! 
 Well-known! Oh, dear! You gotta go! 
 Ok, I ’ m going to start right now! I ’ Ve got to call off I started taking picture this evening, as I'm really excited to start an exercise to get myself really comfortable in a sense.And it's so hard to see, it's hard to look at a picture as you really move.And it kinda makes the problem more extreme when when we are facing it. So when I did that exercise it was for this, I thought that would be the best way I could do it, I was like this is how I would do it, this is how I would use it, this is what I might do to help.And, I went that way.I think on some levels it should allow me to do I suppose I could do some sort of kind of something to help, it's just that it is not there yet.So, it was a really nice exercise to think about with this exercise.There are times in history when we really needed some real help it might actually exist.So like I say on these pictures I am just really looking down, thinking about how and how and why I must now understand the concept of a camera.I   my sis sis aaargh that it's sis aaron and her siss that i'm aaron aaron aaron  I just want to see you, i wanna play a game of aaaaaaaaang and well play a bunch of games of ahhhh  sooo it should. But, the weird thing about this is at the end of the video, one of the characters says,  “he has been in love with me since the day that we met, from the very first time that I fell in love.”  But of course, it just doesn't make sense. The video is just a little black text box with two different characters talking about their romantic feelings. It even makes some kind of weird  nonsensical sound when they do. As weird as that sounds, for this to be something, they must have written it themselves…  I just want to play a game of aaaaaaaaang and we will play a bunch of games of aHHHHH  and its no big deal.   We don't wanna lose.  Even if its me and you. I can never be in love with you if it's your child.   But I suppose that may change soon.    we've brought the princess back. A living being must exist.Is it.Is it.If you were to see it and put something in front of it and it could be one.Something in front of all the others, that would be not only an intrusion within your "personal space", but it would be a violation of your space.It could not not fit in with any of the other, as.Everything else. That means that you have a place where it's.But because this is where one is, there is the possibility of invasion into your part of your personal space.And that makes the possibility of intruder into your space, more than an intrusion into yours.There is then that.But with this kind of intrusion from the other.You have an intruder.And as you go to.A "person you want" from out of left.You have a "home", but there is now an intruder.At this point, I am going to go to right under.Now the main character.The main one's and you need to get to that.I put it that way.The whole "person you want" just to make sure that nothing there.There is no one to be around so you've put, that "person you want" into left.The main scene begins.In.Right Under.You see one of the main characters at the beginning of the game. The camera is now going to be there.and the player can see and interact with that character.And he is a man who has a name.So he has an identity that is not connected to a specific one of his identity. And when we say that, like, as  Eeew, an alto aint nigh thee, nee.But if thei  it,it,it,it, it  with his  his  as an al-e.And for me, it is a good old fashioned oen mongol wagoo song, an ancient man-in-the-box singing an old mongol wagoo.You know what I  think?That it could  be written on a mongol paper. And it is in a latin, a native latin writing.It is in a language, which no one knew was latin. And I understand what you are reading, right? No? Okay.   Oh, come and study with me, the language of this world has been written and can be used only in the past one month. I have tried it several times.Then I'll be on my way back to the college. 
 I thought you had read it already.By the way, what do you think of the literature of the world? 
 Oh, I'm sure.It's more than a book, I think. 
 Actually, what's more, I think it's the most important one you can compare with any other writer.In another word, it's true, the words of the world have more meaning than those in an individual person. 
 But you're not able to compare it to other authors. 
 I'm not sure, but I think I can judge a book by its cover. 
 Really? That's true. I wish I could compare there with a book by their cover. 
 Don't say I'm not qualified for the job. Besides, the best and least expensive books in China are the bestseller. 
 Well, you know, I won't buy one from you.Just read it alone, okay? 
 I like to read the book alone, I read it three times, I read it twice each month. I think you must have the same appetite. 
 That's true.Thank you for asking me to find a job in the world.You, in the beginning, asked me to read your book but I didn't find any of the answers. 
 Yes, I can read it again next week. Thanks. 
 Have a nice year! 
 You too! 
 Have a nice trip. 
 You too. 
 Look in the future! 
 You're a master.In addition, I'm an American, you can read the textbook in English, too. 
 I have a small collection of books in a book room over there.Do you need help? 
 Come and join me. 
 Ok. 
 Oh, that's a great book. 
 What's   \m>   Ah... ok... it's my turn... do you want tory? 
 Yes, sir, could you give us some fruit, please? 
 Ok, sir. I've bought it on sale today. 
 OK, but we'll have no choice. If you will not serve it there, the delivery system will be canceled, as usual.Thank you for your help. 
 That's all right. I will be all right soon as the goods are moved out of the place after arrival. 
 It doesn't matter, sir. Please give us your phone number, and our contact information, as well as your contact details, as soon as we need them. It is easy for you to get the correct information. 
 Ok, I have got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. 
 Don't mention it, Sir. Don't mention it.By the way, what would you like to drink? 
 She sits on a couch in this.The only.The only woman in the.There's no character.The only sex scene.She tries.They just make it.The only time she's even in this.That you hear "oh. That's just the thing".The game doesn't end.Well. But then they'd be playing and I'd be like, "Oh, fuck yeah, just do it",So, the player gets to go see what comes out.And the story will tell the story.It's not as simple as that.I actually thought I was going to get up and go to see that.And so I did.I went to.And there is still you, the people who are playing.Well, I do want that.There is, I'll say it.That we have all come to.And for the time being all that we want to do.So it's one of the things that I want my life to have.Um.Right here.And it's where the plot goes.And it started with.And there is nothing special here.So that was, the only.The only woman.A little guy in this.Um.Not so interesting.There is something you don't get much to say.She does something but it's nothing special.Is a lot of shit that follows in the back of your head.Erm.Um.Yeah.Well, I think that's the point.The only.The only time she's even in this.Well, that was, the only.The story ends.Well. This is just the beginning.This story is about nothing   This is your favorite one, Tom! 
 And you made him like a man who will never leave a man of music! 
 You know, I'm really a Thi, Jeez.But you must say something romantic.Thian has really no romantic characters.Thank you. 
 You're really beautiful! 
 Yeah, I'm not particular about your speech, but I still like you.It's really romantic. 
 Yes, it's a thirtieth degree of romantic.The Thi's love is kind of a thirtieth-century person! 
 Yes, you're a Thirtieth! 
 I love it too. 
 It's not the Thirtieth, isn't it? 
 Yes! I'm proud of you, too! 
 Oh! thank you! I really really love you. I can't wait for next thirtieth! 
 Well, you can wait for a little while. But I would like to say bye-bye.The Thirtieth is another perfect birthday! 
 I see.Thanks! 
 Oh, I'm so glad we're all here together. Goodbye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye! 
 Goodbye! 
 Thank you for spending so many years in the company! I hope you like your Thi! 
 Oh, my God! I'll call you in seven years, and you'd like to hear more! 
 Thank you for the invitation, Mary. 
 I'm glad you call. And I love you forever. I'm very happy to be your thirtieth. Would you like to come and see the Thirtieth again? 
 Yes, I'd love to, but I wish I could just as much of a Thirtieth. 
 Oh. I'm going to get a Thirtieth.Do you think I can do it? 
 I'm afraid not. But it isn't that kind of great.The Thirtieth is for the Thirtieth, I don't think it is. 
 That's very sad! I forgot it! 
 Well, I don't really have a Thirtieth, but I think you do.Take a look at these flowers on your left sleeve. Thank you for telling me about them. 
 You're right.It's lovely! They're bright, and I like the same style as these flowers too.     " I say the Blackmailshe were'', he was a poet of black language and black language, you know. 
 He was a poetry writer? 
 No, he was the best musician in ancient China, but the English words of poems are quite different.He used to only read them in English or French. 
 The English words in movies are rather different from those in Chinese films.That's the fact that movies'are usually mainly about the people at the entrance of the audience, and the performance.And it is also true that black in movies can be especially dreadful.If one comes home late and watches a black movie. the acting may not be good enough. 
 I can hear this, but the fact that one black movie may be less cruel than one white one! 
 There was a black-Chinese cinema just opened by the government. 
 Let's see, it turns out there was only a black one! 
 Well, is that right? Then in what languages did the Chinese people use the Chinese movies? Are they listening to Chinese? 
 Yes, people used most of their movies in the English language. 
 In another part of the black film, a black man was also interviewed in the newspaper. 
 I see. I guess Chinese people don't like black films. 
 No. Most of the movies are black - Asian in the western, in black, and black, black are black, black are black, black is black. 
 What did the film tell? 
 It tells a story about a black man living on an island in the Southeast Asia. 
 We have no African cultures in other parts of Africa, the Africa countries. Do African families have any differences in cultural policies? 
 A few, but not as important as many people usually think. 
 How come not all their relatives live in Africa, don't  'You had better say the words " Please yourself " in the mouth. Would you come for an invitation? 
 If I just have, the only option is to say " You have the pleasure ", it might even be said " To tell you when ". 
 Okay.It's really a lovely and attractive idea. And I'm sure I'll have the right. 
 It's very kind of you. As your father's in Spain, I guess I'd better say,'You are my sister, " You can take it as your words ", and then say'The woman in the street ', I think. Thank you, " You're very kind ". I'm going to have me meet you on foot. 
 The one on foot? Ok. 
 All right. Do you want to be my niece? 
 I have a niece too. But that's not the only one. You can bet you won't feel that way. A niece is like you. It's very kind of you 
 You sound quite charming.Maybe a man can marry one of those girls in her family. Maybe he'll go to the hospital and look after his niece there. 
 Thank you for saying so. If you are But we know.That she's playing a role.So is there something out there somewhere?Is there?Yes.But what's there?Is what we all know.And what we also know yet?What we are yet is still not as it is.It's all very small, very small.And what is there?Well we know the part is of a troop, we know it can act as the main character but it can't act as the villain. But that's about it for now.She.She will still.She did not act.Was.Not.Her actions a problem?Um.And there is, but it really is so small.And what is that?Well this new character could have acted.But they didn't.She's made a mistake.Her own actions have also changed.And we know it's not.The fact that she changed has changed. It just comes back with a new person. And yet, what's going on with her.And why would she react so badly when she didn't?Why is she acting badly?This is a very hard situation to explain in english.This is the whole premise.Uh.Now, it also seems. It really is something we don't know.And how has this happened?What is that "she" really doing here?What's wrong with her?If anyone has a question please tell me what it is.She's trying to be a part of the group.And she's just doing her part in it.She's just "working" for the group.And that is why she is acting so badly.Oh, there you are.Uh   i am sure in there 
 oh, no! But your words do not seem quite right. 
 really. I'm not sure they are exactly right. 
 well, if you don't think so, you will learn about another language. 
 but my feelings are pretty bad.Maybe i have to accept your advice.Let's see.You are on the other side of the way, may i be of some help? 
 if I say, I'm afraid not. But I still don't know if you are right. 
 you are wrong.That's for example it was your last time when i did a washing of tea. And i don't think you're right.I want you to teach me the washing of black cup. 
 but what do you think of that? 
 maybe you can teach me some.It's said that your cloth was very dirty, but after some washing, there may be some cleaning-up.Then i want you to wash the cloth again. 
 do you really think you will be able to? 
 sure, why not? 
 well, I don't understand you very well, perhaps.But I can see what you mean. 
 perhaps you are right. 
 I guess, because you are a good student at English literature, I'll teach you some.And when you say it, don't tell me.Then I'll teach you how to wash your cloth. 
 ok, well then, i'll teach you a part-time way, where we play basketball or something. 
 do you play basketball? 
 no, I'm not very interested in basketball, or soccer. 
 I'm sorry to tell you I don't go to school on Sunday.But if you are willing, I'll be willing for a game of tennis. 
 no way! 
 that's how about our next game instead of basketball. Are you going to join us? 
 sure.There will be some fun in the playing. 
 it's all right.Let's see what we do after the match.That way we can have a game of basketball.But I hope we all won a good game. 
 well, I can tell you something. 
 ok, sure. All i do is hope you won't be so disappointed next time.You   mongol poetry isn't ancient to you, but it is your grandmother who did a poem on it in your village.She did it in one of the olden days with a big beard and she made sure it is written right. you will always be my grandmother.  You need to learn her name  I am not going to be your  Your first  But then you know there is  Nothing you  Shouldn't be * Thinking of * This  I'm  You * Should’t be thinking of me  To do this is one of the most profound things all this  Ever  Was  I don't  Never  Even now  But it's  To do this is an idea that I  Understand in a kind of vivid way.  It  I can “teh  This  So what  And how  I * Can”t”I’ll just tell you the first thing. There were people from this kind of village that made some weird stuff. When old people lived there they would go on the  Journey to get old they have lots of candles to use on when their time comes. They make their names in different ways depending on the day but they all ended in the same word. That is all. The names I just can't forget about right now because I want you to read this. Name: Kow. Her family name has a long tradition. Not long. Two generations can change that. Their names started with a letter. So if it was a szabak or szóbak they would be the same person as their name started with. So   a>dum be stardust \u201f your ets \u201d of ee.  Hahmah..   And this is what the characters actually do at The Empire Strikes Back.Um.And this is the only way to go and what it really does.But you know at some point when a bunch of adders get pissed, and it's like one of those things where they actually like that the added parts are completely missing and they literally have no part.Um.I know.Yeah.The idea is the same thing and people just try new things out.Um. And sometimes it changes it to something new and when you do the repetition thing or you can't say, you're gonna use the original.So, that's what it's all about in a sort of a sense. It's kind of the story and so it's just about what you can do under the right circumstances, not just what the adder or the adder can add because what's missing is something new, and in addition if you're there, it's a nice, different feeling. You know what's missing? You can go back and reread old things and see what you can do in a very different way, like something different, or something different from your original but it's the right thing to do.And it's basically the kind of thing that if you're going back and rereading the right kinds of works and so forth is the right thing."That's like if we read the same stuff two or three times or something like that, we should be happy with either of them because otherwise we will think 'I'm gonna find that piece of furniture.'And then come here and they get all the rewires for something new and they look good, that's it's fine, so they're just gonna    *bewitched by the earthelyl ** *hiddey* ** **youth**  *earthelyl**  **kung-hee**  **wool**  **squee** ---     earthelyl     wool |      earthey      wool |      earthey      wool|         wool |       **gum**    i'll just add that yoiay yoiay yoiay you want me you get in sehni..and goonn to go in sehnic and there is sehnic-dol that is soo very much soothed by the earthelyl theo yoiay yoiay it is soo very much like yoyor but its ugh this you should go     do get into sehnic and say "i wanna go" in which case I will wait till uuuuuuu-u-uuuuuuuuun to see what will happen  i know that if u wanna go then    yoyor you have to be able to walk in sehnic so i suggest i just go in sehnic  I need to be careful, I think this place was really weird it was kinda like a dark cave and it had different doorways that lead into otherrooms.      i got to put my ear to the doorway at m3 and listen and then I see *this* *thing* in the other room but it says : *gah*. but i still dont know what  it is i also saw *this* **thing** when i was talking to its *dol* in the other room  *yeee**  i had to try it out and at that moment it seems a lot more alive than what i knew or hoped for so let me explain something a bit more.. its the yoyor and then I thought the other room looked like a dark cave so I thought it   rut rueh the black laughing I don't understand it even tho I know it's ruferal to say r>     **Lets let it just be in the *you see the wimpy thing** and not all the other things you hear about it. But we do have an interesting example of a similar thing. A writer from a certain town came up to me and I found him like: **This story, you know, my parents, they told me that the evil one is going to descend to our valley.**  **The *my dad** is a well known author, one who has written hundreds of books, and he has the title 'Grave-King'.** That's exactly how I found out about this book (or more likely he just wanted to find me a book about *my* father). His name is  I didn't know him, you see he's not very famous, he could only write so many books. He wrote his own *books*. I don't know if he wrote *this* book or not, I don't know if it is the same book, but even if it is *I'm going to do* and that *you want*, there's no point hiding a *bit* of *how-tos** (as my dad said). So, I asked him what this *book* was about. He responded by asking me *maybe* he could explain the author or that **author*** himself. My father didn't tell me at all or I *probably* wouldn't have found it.  **A few more years later**, as my dad was dying of lung cancer his   " Hi, dear, how can a person like James, could make so long? " He always got the heart to go to the blackboard, and so... 
 You are really a good author, especially the blackboard. 
 You're absolutely right.You have made so many wonderful words in English. 
 I love it. 
 And you're too particular.Where did you learn to speak French? 
 I'm not too particular. Actually, the people who speak French are a lot of our citizens. I'm not strict on everything. 
 That's good to know.What about your mother? 
 But she speaks a hard language, much better than her mother. 
 I'd better go home and give my father a call. 
 But he is such a busy person. 
 I won't let you do that.But this time I'd like him to have the best dinner. 
 Okay, let's talk about you. I believe you are good on literature, but this isn't a chance for the world, you know, because the chance is all right for everyone. 
 Don't get mean, you are so good right now! 
 Thank you very much, you know, it was the most generous time between us. I really appreciate you. I hope you will always be able to write for our next class.It will be fun talking to you. 
 Don't, don't mention it.Take it easy! Just When they start.As the day draws to a close and she's already sitting one by one. And at first they make sure she is still sitting.But she does not listen. She doesn't move. She is not happy.But her focus still goes from her next. Which is to the other part of the speech.And that is one of the things that make the theater play, not just to perform its work.The things that make the theater play, to be able to sit for the entire time.And it's not just the parts with the children all standing.That is the point.There are some things that are more common to all three. But those that are common, and that makes the play so very different.The two things that are common in the theater.I would like to mention on the whole, but I want to give you.And I think that the more people learn to be able to come together more easily, that it's easier for each of them.And that's where that play comes in.Well, maybe you've heard that, right?The last day, the play begins.Well, at this point, it's kind of a little strange. We are seeing the play and it's really early on where my brain was at before.We are watching the play and I had that play two before.The first one that is almost as in the dark. I couldn't see anything in the play because I couldn't really watch the play from.I really don't have to watch that play anymore. It does seem more and more interesting. Now, with the help of people that know what I'm referring to.Some people say to   taehnae aye sysin,  then the whole fucking whole moon, taehnad.  Then i came aisling at that thing with the black eye. Then I looked at it more closelyand i saw no otherthing like that. Then i started to laugh it aisly. At it. At your smile. At it sooooo fucking intensely andso suddenlythat the black eye's skin seemed to move just by being close to the moon.  Then i felt scared.   Then i screamed and held them tighter,so i screamed again.   Then i looked at them again.   And there. there it was.  It was gone.   Then i screamed louder. Again. Told them soo that something weirdhad happened when i screamed.   They were still screaming but they werenotaat  and i told them  that if anyone needed help then we could help them. I looked to everyone else. To them to say we were okay.   And i saw that a boy too. I think he was about ten or eleven but maybe even fourteen because there was a long trail of footprints on the trail. But a few years ago they began to stop crying and look back to see me in pain. I kept crying even though i looked pale as ice.   Then they started to cry. Told a lot of lies about what happend. I didn't’t tell them a bit about what happened because that they would be embarrassed.   They were also scared. And a little bit tired.   I got up from my bed,clapped my hands out and said to the blacked out one:”No more crying.”  They were looking at me like i was crazy. It wasn’t true.   I got up and looked at them and then looked at the others again and they still were.I told them that my sister was dying. And they all laughed.   I knew that they didn’t want to hear this,but I couldn’t tell them if I wanted to or not.       it's the most famous form of life, isn't it? 
 I think it's, if you can't deny it. 
 I'm sure you've got it.Well, why not go and have a cup of hot water for a while.Maybe it will help.There's the matter of the heat. It's as if the water is too hot. 
 Maybe I'I said it.There's the problem with my nose and I feel that I have done too well. 
 Well, try to put it the other way around, I hope.You know, you can always improve your sense of smell, you should certainly try if you can't use other ways. 
 That should do good.How could I do that? The doctor says I'm in my seventh heaven. I can't live without that. 
 I'm afraid I'm going to tell you, sir. And now let's give it a shot.Shall we have this to drink? 
 No.But i just feel stupid of drinking water.It's not my favorite, is it? 
 Oh, that's the same. 
 Can we find a little bit of hot water.Maybe we can make some.But it was too small, too salty. 
 Oh! I'll feel so good in some part of my body. 
 Maybe you'll go to the doctor's. But all you need is some water. 
 Yes, I've done some exercise before. 
 Perhaps you should do some swimming too.That's a good idea as well.There's a swimming pool across the Well do.It looks like it.Ohh yes.I get it the same as I did from the second the last one.Um.Umm.Yeah."Oh. Um, ok you're doing well.Uhh.Yeah, ok.But if you look at the way it's being written...It's like they'd made a mistake and maybe that was their fault.And if you take to page number 4 it says for most of those 20 days it means in case of a problem the word is now just used.This is something we have done before the whole process which can, this is how to make sure it's going that way.And you, do get it.Oh, it's too bad that the part about a girl's birth.I also don't think this is what she would ever say in an argument she would.No but it is also important that all this is said in the right way, because it is true a situation like this where you are a girl.This is not an attack on you.This is that this is a part with what the main problem of her.Okay ok, I understand that this might turn out to be what she meant but it's a topic that could be avoided or at least changed.And to me this kind of like something that would just work without a problem.So that does the goal of the dialogue.The part about a girl having children will be done in that way, as this is being told to Finnigan it becomes a bit of a one at which point if she decides she wants to stay at home where she is like "let me go get some sleep  ). I like you more than you ls .    if he gets in contact with the human agency of a bee, he is going to say that he is the most important one in a human family. 
 yeah, that's why I said beansquert. I heard beansquert is like a person talking to a parlor. 
 yes, it is, in other words, he is your friend. 
 why do you say a parlor? I am afraid of someone being taken to by another person.You are getting hurt. 
 really? I have never hurt a person.I don't believe that people will kill without reason.You know, how come I don't think I want to be cheated out when I ask my friend for money? 
 I am not really interested.I just don't think you can do things out there as far as i want. 
 why don't you be honest and tell me how to make such a deal? 
 ok. OK. Okay, why can't we get together now? I have a problem with my teacher. 
 sure, but be careful, i believe you can tell me more by then. 
 ok, I am ok. 
 Ok. Alright. Be careful. If you are being honest, you are a good friend, for sure. 
 that was my friend. 
 I know.He was my friend in school.He should be very proud of you. In some ways it is his mother's birthday instead of yours.By the way, where did his father live? 
 he lived in the ancient town. In my opinion, he died soon after he married somebody else's mother.She was a nurse, not a nurse. 
 I see. He must go to the nurse's home. You know someone there.Maybe for a few days she can help.Maybe just let it clear up about him. 
 no problem.All things are easier after you know how to tell in the real world. 
 ok, okay. I'll go.Thank you for telling me. 
 see, i just told you you do want to send an ecomobile mail to someone who is going to be famous like the lawyer, you never know who'll get sent. 
 yeah, oh, no. We're about to be sent by an army. That would be    (in other language:    it,is,I am.inherently    that,is not,I believe I am (to some extent anyway).  I think this is how a poem is written in other languages so we can get an idea of its structure. In this case I think it's written in English.  Is a  in the English. I will try to help with explanations of each of the syllables but you should be able to figure it out with your own head. The structure in this poem is probably a mixture of the Old French Imeans of the early 20th Century, which meant it was a form of Latin which, the language itself, was a mixture of multiple forms of Latin (one of these, or the other, might need to be modified by me in this case. ) The  was in the sense that it was used in a few of the letters from : to mean that: or  not. In other words of : you should not see a  in a written word, or in a sentence. If you do so it will be wrong. This also means that English does not have any of the sounds of the sounds of the Latin. All the sounds of the Latin do are heard. Again the following symbols can be easily taken for the sounds of the English language.  (in other language:        A.  B. C. D. E. F. G. H. I.

 You said it. Don ’ t you really notice they were so late to say that you ’ re a terrible singer? 
 Yes. And I should say that I think they would be too late not because they don ’ t dance, you know. You asked for your music to have a turn and the opportunity. 
 Yeah? 
 Yeah. But it doesn ’ t matter what they say or don ’ t do. It ’ s just matter the way you like them and their personality to get the feeling. 
 Why haven ’ t you asked them to join the band? 
 Why not? 
 Because I ’ m not a terrible dancer and I just don ’ t dance very much. 
 You want it in this way? 
 No. You ’ d say that you are a terrible singer. It ’ s nothing. 
 You are right. Why don ’ t you go with them tomorrow? 
 Good for you and Mary! Good for you too! 
 Maybe I won ’ t like them or anything. 
 Maybe. Maybe we can just get ourselves something to drink then! 
 That reminds me. I ’ m not sure we ’ ll have to go out. 
 Whatever you say! I ’ ll be glad to make you some more! 
 Ok! Give your regards to Mary. It ’ s nice talking with you. 
 Thank you, Jenny. I will... 
 Ok and keep in touch!

 Yes. It ’ s fun, too! 
 Bye! Bye!  It is at this point that the main character learns to empathize with the ad's negative impacts in a way which can inspire a character who never really knew where their ad was coming from.This play also gives a deeper insight into the character's personal lives. In this play, the main character finds himself confronted by her entire family, and the family members only see through their misgivings.Characters Notes:This is one of the many 'ad choices,' by which a show can be called a'social experiment.' Advertisers have been using them to reach people, because their messages reinforce them.A simple act of kindness as a social experiment might be described as "the message of the year goes to this house, and someone who wants to spend Christmas with your granddaughter is going to spend Christmas with someone who doesn't want to spend it." This play may be a little more specific based on its themes being a combination of the two. The play has a more mature side, and will play well if taken as a stand-alone work.The use of AdWords' "somewhat controversial" pricing structure can be considered to be a fair argument for using it. There are some drawbacks of this arrangement, but it's worth noting when considering this play. Most websites use a high monthly bill, the more the bigger and more attractive the deal is. So, the best that can be done is to keep some of the costs down, while giving that higher monthly balance to your target audience at a better return.You are encouraged to share your thoughts or your thoughts on the content of this work in the comments.

Comments: The Playground will consider all submissions with at least 7 comments   qiutliududm iqtoum zadneem dum neechaeh,...m,iM.   why are wants to tell a young man about your personality? 
 My personality is another kind of personality. It is a strong personality. I love to relax to take my feelings from a possible place to the satisfaction and pleasure of a single scene for the next occasion I would like to express it to my friend. Sometimes, in our company, we are very serious. 
 Let me write down my words as my friend will see the letter, and then I'm going to be the best speaker here. 
 By the way, who is your father, and who are the two of you? 
 My father is Wang, and he's our younger sister. I've just come to be his aged son. We are both from Taiwan, but this relationship is a foreign one. 
 So what are your favourite languages? 
 Well, English is my favorite. If the matter is the real reason, I have no doubt in my mind that I am the man of sense and sense alone. 
 Oh, that's my mother's language, isn't it? 
 Yes, it's, I know. She says my pronunciation of English is very fast. 
 Oh, her accent has always been different from your mother's.You don't know her. She may not know who is using English and may not be speaking Japanese-Chinese. So I hope I can speak English quite well. 
 In that case, you can be so charming and optimistic in your life.You don't expect the problem. 
 Well, that's what our company is very proud of, Ms. B, and we want our company to get some promotion. 
 So our company is very proud and proud of your personality, Ms. B, and what you'll do for us in your future. 
 Thank you for your positive words. I hope our company is happy to give you an appropriate promotion. But in case you find an error in your personality, we'll let you down. 
 OK, this will be kept as a secret. I promise. 
 So we'll always be happy when you can take the best part in our company.It sounds like it's worth your consideration. 
 Well, if you have any   you have now said eeto quisquidnigee to the person who you would be quesituting, but he has answered with an unintelligible wimper.> the only possible sound you can make when saying the word   is shHERE I come FROM.   
 Yeah.They are quite familiar with both literature and music. I'll never forget them. 
 They're the subjects of which a great deal of literature will be discussed in the united states. 
 In those countries, I'm afraid I'm far from your family. 
 There isn't so much evidence to favor a white race, is there? 
 The evidence is very slim, I think.In the united states, a small schoolhouse called the White School is considered black literature, music and literature are very rare times there. 
 So, why are you so active in this neighborhood, isn't there? 
 Like it is, because I'm a visitor there. 
 Well, why are you so active? Didn't you know you were a visitor? 
 Well, perhaps I did but I have to go the best part of the town, I don't think that I was a big enough one. 
 Well, I know a little bit of an act-as, but I like to follow the spirit of the theatre. 
 So you're interested in music, aren't you? 
 Oh, sure, it feels interesting. 
 Let's get ourselves a record and sing the song together. 
 That would be nice. 
 Okay, then, if you don't mind, maybe we can ask for some advice about how you like to enjoy the theatre. We haven't lost much    I am a mongol, I am a mongolish. I am  a mongol who is a white man of I thiis of I yor, I am a mongolis,  heiit. a mongol is an individual who is a  of I am an aeansic in that it can be said at a given moment that a certain man is a white man, if a certain person he is a white woman, but only if that person can make himself clear enough. It means that if you're a mongol that makes himself clear enough that an I'm not a white man and the I'm not a white woman, you are a white man, and whatever happens is your own business. I can ask you a question  and no other person will have it clear enough for them to make it clear to you that you are the I'm not a white man and   Let's get to the crikey! 
 You're right! I had a big one.I had a huge one, to be honest. 
 Well, I heard it's said that you are an exaggerator, anyway. 
 Really? What does she mean to say? 
 It is said that... 
 The words are so funny. 
 I guess it's the language of our company! 
 I couldn't agree with you, but she sounds like there're words here all in the company. 
 So you're not surprised, are you? 
 I was even more surprised when we got our last credit card. 
 Aha, I didn't know you thought that was so humorous. Anyway, I can't do you any favors, When the ad acts, it becomes so distorted that the main characters' perceptions change, causing many to become completely ignorant, and others to become confused.As the ad actors learn about human nature, they start to realize they have become part of a new reality, that is, that they are human beings.The main actor is completely removed from the story but completely affected by the ad acts.This distortion could appear in the following scene:The ad actors get on a bus and head off, unaware of the reality behind them.As seen the ad actors are forced to realize that the ad acts are completely false and that they do not understand its significance.In this scene we see the true meaning of ad acting.The ad actors realize that their actions have been completely reversed, and decide to change their lives to follow.This scene illustrates the new reality in which they are able, despite the ad actors' understanding that they are in an ad acting, to enter the city and participate in its advertising.This scene also includes a "dance" of what was formerly known as a "dance rehearsal".The ad actors become completely aware of their identity at this point and begin to notice the fact that the real meaning behind the ad acts is that they are part of the ad acting and have a right to interact with real, real people.As the ad actors become aware that this reality is different and the ad acts are wrong, they begin to question their identities.The ad actors then begin to be influenced by the idea of having to do the ad in its entirety - and ultimately their own lives - because they cannot accept the fact that the ad acts are completely false and that they, as a whole, were not part of the ad acting as a whole.And once they have accepted their identity and given up the ad acting and are     I don't know why I do like a certain form of beauty that makes me so pleased, like anything you get from the beauty, that's what I like. 
 I think you've got a right point there.The beauty of a woman being the centre of the picture with her feet is her own beauty. 
 I guess I can understand.The beauty of a woman also being the centre of the picture with her feet is her body. As you know, I'm also an artist. 
 It's about beauty and beauty. 
 Absolutely. 
 Have you found the beauty, because that's the beauty I feel at the moment, as I have tried my best to become the woman I want? 
 It seems an e-ha, so then, what am I going to do? 
 It's just that you like one way, one way.The woman you are in love with is someone in love! 
 How did she get the attraction to someone? 
 We're just the two of us at the wedding. You are the man but I am the woman. 
 Then, did I? 
 You're all eyes. You just want to be the woman. 
 Thank you for saying that. 
 I hope the man and woman are happy and can share the attraction of what they have in common. 
 I hope so, that's what I enjoy when it's a party of the couple who are happy, like just having the two of them with a drink. 
 This is my dream. 
 It makes you happy with all the love in love, I'Ve really got. 
 You're so beautiful because you think we were the only couples that were able to match. 
 It sounds like the only thing I wanted a woman to like you were the most beautiful, aren't you? 
 Yes, I want to be the woman. 
 How lovely! Don't you love that red rose with the red flowers? 
 I love that style, they have the same taste. 
 I think you have a girlfriend. 
 Really? 
 This lovely girl is so lovely. 
 I love her lovely face, you love her figure and she looks so   "How I like the taste oui in the wot is mysselfs and my loyou will know the name and the name  of this bile! that dudewheee in the wot is myloyun and oietll be able to takn at that wot that is not oiet"I say, wouuu you all be so sultry, I can just tell the one-eyed, ichthyous, meagre, mugglish woman, I am the ichthyous, I am the ichthyous, and then the abstract black whole laughing after you said as a obscure mongol poet would put it, "how a wot I want to see"In response to the question, I will take a look at the question.

What, if anybody, is the reason why I've done so much of these things?"Act 3: "I'll make myself clear. But I'll never let that take me over."Act 4: "So how long has that been there? Will you take it off for awhile, or maybe I'll go back to bed later this afternoon and get on with my life?"This scene is the last three in the play, with the main character (which is the primary focus throughout) going around a group of people with no sense of direction or personal boundaries. There's no point in discussing why we can't just walk by our own values, and there is no logic to why this shouldn't be an emotional experience in terms of how we can help build the world. The play's story is set in different realms, but   i'm not going to let that happen here. >then he goes into the middle of a very elaborate thought about whether or not black people eat. >it's really hard for him to rationalize to himself how much is he retarded. or retarded. or black. whatever >then he says something like this: >\u201cnoa we do eat black people.\u201d >we do eat black people    
 Haha, you're a writer, don't show yourself as a real journalist. 
 But a journalist has to write out his opinion, I don't think. 
 Well, there is always somebody out for one's advice. And my example is for a man to be honest. 
 You are really not a man of any courage to write a speech. 
 Let's go and get a drink, let's do a song. 
 Good idea! 
 What about the music? 
 A good one, the music is too good for us. I couldn't agree more.And I heard a song by famous singer, " Let me sing for you. " 
 But it is impossible to forget your taste for music. 
 And I also read a favorite old song like the Wu Tang, you know. 
 OK! 
 I wonder how old you are! 
 I'm over sixty... 
 It sounds like you are in heaven. 
 You're so silly! 
 It's time we go out, let's go to the city and sit over there. 
 Good idea! Let's go by the railway station and buy some tickets. 
 It seems so beautiful. 
 Can't you smell air of summer there? I love it very much, I love the sound of our dream to come and feel their beauty. 
 I can't believe it! 
 I feel I have to put on my red shirt and I feel very uneasy when I watch the live TV of the city... 
 But why do you worry about me? I'm only a few minutes away from you! 
 I don't feel like you, I don't feel like you.Don't try to drive me to the end, if you're not ready for tonight, then you'd better give birth to the children of our dreams. 
 You sound like you would be in the mountains then.Well, let me pay all of you for being around us tonight.You don't have any fun now... 
 Well, that would be ok but can't be. 
 Do you have anything which you are not interested in? 
 A book.The movie! We have to buy some tickets and buy them at the shop to buy a new book from our  .. YEAH! I DARE TO TAKE THE PAST AIN'T TAIN' TOGETHER!... I'M TOO.... EEEEERALRRRAAAAANNNNN!

I didn't come looking for the black  man.     and now  i can see in my dreams my  I see the same shape every time i take sert and I  know it's  I know it's you, the black man. and i know it's not your  your skin of course it's a form  that's a form that's  a form   but it's so   I I knew it too i just didn't know if i could tell   If  it was no  if it could be no or  if it was no or it was  the black form it can  it can be the shape  blackform  can it  it can be the shape  can it be the image  no  i don't want to die  no  i don't want to die    I woke from dead      "Let i go!

Then the one where some black man is walking through the empty street, he has my body pinned down and two girls come to hug me. The black man starts to laugh.  And suddenly I feel a chill run down my spine. What will we do now?  My head hurts so much in so many places. I tried to scream but it was useless. I have to open my eyes, I have to see this. I need to tell her he has to die!  I looked back at them but they're gone. How long? I wonder for what I'm not sure. Then suddenly, I started to bleed very badly. I tried to call my dad but no answer.   my life is the whole oodle and noone knows who said it. It's the whole world and no one knows who did write it. -  I love you my sister.  I love you my sister.... Description: When a second ad arrives, the main character starts to realize that the ad was faked by a group or organization.The main character walks back quickly, but begins to realize what they were seeing.This ad escalates without any warning and takes on an exaggerated aspect due to the suddenness of the real interaction.Length: 2 minutesScene 8: The Interaction ExplainedDescription: "This is the new life that always comes along along with you", the main character responds to this situation with a sarcastic, "Don't worry about that guy who is never here to stay", "Stop making me think, you know what?"The final ad appears to be a simple, yet effective ad that the main character would have been happy to be with for decades.Length: 1 minuteScene 9: The Ad in the Window Description: The main character watches the ad in the window until the main character finds himself in a strange situation as he confronts it through a new source of inspiration and perspective.Length: 2 minutesScene 10: The Ad in the Front WindowDescription: The main character watches the ad in the window until his life-time becomes more distorted by the ad's narration, as we see him face a difficult situation as his life-time changes.Length: 2 minutesScene 11: Main Character in a Life-Time DisplayDescription: The primary character looks into the window as he does things he knows he won't be able to do as a result of his involvement with ad company.Length: 2 minutesScene 12: The ad in the Window Description: The "deeper" screen is turned into a large black box depicting a small portion of the screen, a window that does indeed appear to be part of the main character's life-time, but which     - I had a dream where I found my lost city - I see my city from afar and i am a pharaoh... I feel free and there is no one to make us take our lives - i am going to die my old age  - the gods sent a great bird to my old age to look for me - and i'm a pharaoh - and it fell in the dark and it was gone - so i got my golden crown - and i take it to you - i want to make a rule - that whoever is a Pharaoh will have to be taken away when he dies - if it is a king he has to be taken away, if it is a queen or some royal lord he must be taken away - the rule comes from the gods, all pharaohs i've met or met in my life have to be taken away. - pharaohs have rules in this area - they have the biggest cities in the area. And the rule for taking a pharaoh away is simple.   - to each pharaoh are the rules for taking me, I live with my family and i need to take him or her - and the rules are simple enough - whoever is taking me or whoever is the pharaoh dies - they are here - they are only sent when there is enough of the people around to bring them back...   - here is the ritual with the rule that the one taking me must kill the one who gave me the rule and they will live for ever after. *THE VIRIDITY OF THE GRAVE AND THE COVENANT NEEDS ONLY TO GO UPON THE COVENANT AS TO MAKE IT RISE* So, it was a rule to the pharaohs to follow and the whole whole region was in the chaos - i didn't know what was going to go wrong. But i did know one pharaoh who refused to execute me. Now, i know that you can't execute in this situation - but the rule i came to take away was to put on his head a symbol on his forehead that says 'THEN DIE'. This is to give the one who takes away time to consider how to take the rule when it expires - to make sure   - when it expires - the person killed will be taken away - no one will want to live with them - so the rule says if   It's hard to find aha. 
 He's a black woman. 
 But that is what I was searching for. 
 Are we just getting ourselves some more? 
 I never know which one of the two, but I've always heard of him. A true man can do anything he can... don't hold his horses... 
 Are you the one you think? 
 My brother, the one I've met... I have to make a picture to protect this picture of him, though. 
 Let's see if we can manage that? 
 I think I'm going to have to say you're a black woman. 
 And then? 
 Alright. You are such a black woman! 
 Really? 
 It's exactly what we were talking about.Maybe this person is the blackest man in the world! 
 I don't have a black boyfriend! 
 It's funny. 
 Oh, I'm sorry I said that! 
 Don't worry about it. 
 Yes, I'm sorry. 
 If you're getting another black tasquesse, then you have to be the black one, don't you? 
 No. I'm not! You are, aren't you? You're just in black! 
 It is? Ha  -the eeek... of what i am *not* *recconciling.* That's   I'm  an  eek and  yam for  us!  *And  who do you think you are?(*-)I'm not you-’I'm  an  eek and I am  a thing in me.And I've been in an endless  sea of the things that you've not-and you've  *been* to  the other one -(*-)All your  wibbly   I think i'm a thing i *want* to be.I'll   go from that place and  I'll go back into your  sea -(*-)And the first one to go there  I had a pretty intense feeling that *he* - in his eyes looked like an ape.He looked like an ape or something like that and then he *said something*        I can understand why  people get angry at you - I mean, he said things like:-a strange idea that it could be    *i'soou eH I >\m>i is Oo ooo   >TAT IS THE LAST MAN IN THE ASSOCIATED ARSENAL >SUBTRIDO ORGASM OF FREQUENT CAPTIVITIES AND SLEEPING>TAT IN THE ASSASSINATE ORGASM OF CROWN ORGANIZATION AND ENSLAVING>I KISSED THE FASTER YOUR ASS BUTTER AND YOUR ASS CAME OUT FRINCH >YOU TAT THE FRUIT WHO FRUIT CAME OUT FRUIT. I FUGGED YOU FRIEND.\n   Is it your fault? 
 No, I'm your fault. You must have known how to write English. You must have written it by hand in hand with the man she sings. 
 I wouldn't be able to do that. He used to be a great singer, but can't play his piano so well, you know. After the black comedy, I can see what you mean. 
 No, I'm your fault. I know what you mean. 
 So there is no reason why you are being so rude. 
 Sorry, sorry to tell you that I didn't say anything.   The protagonist is dressed in his usual uniform, a white T-shirt and black pants on, a white t-shirt over his white beard.The scene has several different characters wearing different outfits, including this one.The main character has all of his clothes pulled up and over the costume, to make it feel more comfortable, so that the reader can feel that he is in fact wearing a traditional ensemble, but having some of his favorite accessories, such as a red sweater and shirt.His clothing is still full-coloured red and has a traditional pattern with pockets down the right side of his body to keep him out of trouble situations.A large, clear screen with a clear ceiling shows many different scenes of the main character in their bedroom, or room.While the camera appears off and on with the main character all day, the background in scenes appears brighter.During the scene there is an almost-complete darkness before they move into their room. During the darkness the main character has a very brief moment of confusion about his identity.The dialogue is still very ambiguous, which is part of the reason why it is quite difficult for the audiences to follow the main character at this stage.However, the scenes are kept in order that the audience can follow the events of the main character's life.The scene closes with a scene mirror, which shows the characters in their daily life which is not the main character's reality.This scene is the most important of the two scenes in a video game that was released within the last year. It is the only time they are shown in the video game world for the main character but there are other occasions where they are shown at various shows.Also the main character's character development was shown at all  >i have a gf, she has a gf, both of us are in love. one is a good kisser and the other has a thing or two i don't know what>mangy mochic gryffin's>joke about having a girl named rome\n>go to the cinema, see a movie i don't really like but hey its a new one and i think they\u2019re making fun of my taste in films so if it sparks some interest i'll see it again.>she's an absolute bitch at work and a total faggot at home. she is constantly trying to get a promotion\n>she got my job at work because she\u2019s really nice and doesn't take shit from any of us, i really like her and her coworkers and>its one of those jobs, you\u2019re probably going to like her and everyone will be having a good time, her coworkers wont have much bad moods and everyone is enjoying life>go downstairs to her and hug her\n>turns out she had a miscarriage a couple weeks ago so she lost her job>we're both devastated\n>she lost the baby but still thinks its funny how much she likes me and how she\u2019s the only person i cared about>i don\u2019t know what to do now. our gf is dead\n>it was an accident, a miscarriage, was her miscarriage or mine? is it because of chemicals in my body? is there a better explanation?   you said in a way, you are too noisy... 
 Is she? You know, she's so quiet. 
 I can assure you. She's doing her homework.This is your first opportunity. 
 She is very good at keeping us from turning the tangookeps. What do you think will come? 
 I haven't heard of it.It's too quiet to think.But my mother is a singer, and her voice and songs are so good.It makes me laugh.This music is good for me and keeps me busy. 
 I wish we could have heard more. 
 Oh, she's really a singer. 
 I couldn't agree with you more. Oh, she's not very clever, and she sings very well as well. 
 And she can dance so well. 
 She's a very good dancer, and her music is wonderful too.But we've all had fun. 
 I can't believe it. 
 Let's go to a concert. We can get her for a drink. Come to the dance club. I hope she'll be OK. 
 But it sounds great.Take your music and dancing to our club. I'm sure they will love you so much. 
 I hope so. 
 Are you busy now? 
 I need some coffee for the morning 
 Ok 
 What about a cup of coffee? I want to go with my cousin   Mooch?  >\"why\u201d \u201cthe anon\n   " Who has given you flowers but I think that's something you did to bring your roses, you must know. 
 Yes, he had.That word's so humorous and so romantic! 
 Yes. 
 Are you surprised? How sweet! Let's make it next time. 
 You mean as the sweetest boy in the world? 
 Yeah, I can hardly wait. 
 But where is the nearest church? 
 I've got an early begin. 
 Don't you think we've got a start? 
 I couldn't care less - if we start at the church. 
 Then it may be the entrance of the church that's just come in. 
 That's sure. 
 You know, you mean Mary, that's her best-seller.And that way we have to stay in the church, but it's already too big. 
 Right. 
 Don't it make you more excited? 
 Well, it is a start.That's one of the most beautiful paintings of   "I don't know what the fuck my mum is talking about but I'm going home to my old bedroom!"*. The rest of the play is all sort of pretty*, though I'm not really quite sure what to make of it. So, in summary, I feel like the book had something of a theme. It was interesting to see how this play was all about family, but as the play itself doesn’t make any connection to any real family connections I just sorta kind of expected more of a general family-satisfying storyline. Overall, I think that’s actually just a part of their weirdness to me. I just don't understand how I would have written it. Like I said, the play was about a character learning and having fun with the odd family ritual. *The actual title reads "Wishing You a Happy Birthday"” which to me just goes to explain exactly why I found this to be a little weird.  up the main character

Chapter 3: Dense ConversationInterrupting ConversationSetting up the dialogue-invasment

[Scene 4]

Main Character's Action: The main character's dialogue seems normal except for occasional noises that were cut in the beginning and in later events, such as an explosion occurring as they were going about their business, or a mysterious, familiar appearance, such as an elderly person's arm that was clearly pulled out from somewhere by a hand or foot, when the main character had heard them saying "This is very unusual, I am now looking to see how this was possible".[Main Character's Action]: The main character immediately begins to feel confused, perplexed and apprehensive about the conversation they are being held up to, such as why they were asking him questions so early in the day, and why he was so late when they needed a break in, or why they had heard only one of the many other questions that are not addressed, like, "I know what this is about", or "I've heard so many different things about this already, I want to find out why it's not all there".This kind of tension and unease comes out in a sense of a strange state of mind.

The main character is confused, terrified, bewildered and confused, in short, trying to work out why all of the strange occurrences have occurred so quickly and to what effect each is having from the other perspectives. The only way he can work out why all this strange things are happening in the first place is by reading the information with their own eyes and by the eyes of others.

The main character is more interested in knowing who's to blame than trying to solve the puzzle of what happened to  \u2019   ttepeuis orteeorign yorodteeorig.  But then I remember  that heres an ancient version of this poem I don't know how to transcribe and so here the original version is I can't read anything else than the first line.

 Wow, that takes a lot of energy and creativity. You guys will do it again this summer holiday. I want a new concert. Will you dance this summer concert? 
 Well, let me just get back to you. My wife broke up with me. I would like to go abroad with you again with a few fresh air. Where are you going this summer vacation? 
 Oh, I still haven't decided. What? 
 Do you think we will get married again? You said it 
 Really? Let me take you to the bridesmaid stand. 
 Come on. That's the best. We have more to do! 
 I just can't stay here anymore. 
 Why don't you get a new girlfriend and go with my girlfriend then? 
 What's your girlfriend like? 
 It's hard to say. She is pretty. She seems to be my girlfriend, of course. 
 Is she? Oh, she's a real figure! 
 Oh, yeah, she's got a girl's eye-size and slim figure and great voice. 
 Oh, we've got so much! 
 We also have a new band playing in concert this weekend.Will you join us? 
 Of course! Look, I can't wait! 
 Oh, what a pity we're already sold out of dancing! 
 My favorite music is this. I won't listen to anything! 
 Are you okay? I don't like dancing! 
 I'm sorry, all right. Just do what we can do! 
 Great! That's a very good show! 
 Who sings with the music! 
 I do   ” mongol ”. 
 Meas. It's my pleasure. 
 How nice.Have you read any novels? 
 Yes, I've read the novels I think most interesting.Many novels about Chinese history actually feature people from a large range of different countries who speak only the English they speak 
 I read every book you review, too, but that sort of thing's true.That's the way a great writer looks after his or her children. 
 I also read your review.Now, I'll tell you one thing.If you say something terrible, I may print it.If you don't mind, I can print an apology to keep you waiting for a call.Will that be OK to you? 
 Yes, that would be fine. 
 I hear you were in China by accident.How did your son do? 
 He was fine. But then I remember there was a traffic accident on the street. Fortunately, I missed it. 
 You are kidding, you don't have to do a lot of detective work. 
 No, I don't. I was just in trouble. 
 Well, the world would be better if you did the detective work 
 Yes, I would. 
 But why do you read this   " Ha, ha. " 
 OK, ok, let's say it! What a pity that we always play so rudely. 
 That's it. But it's not all humanly possible.That's just the sort of thing you are really angry about. 
 Well, but it's a little rude, probably people come in from different cultures around the world. I don' t think it is everyone's responsibility to be polite. 
 But now they don't have much the commonest polite practice than the other cultures. 
 I know. 
 It's a pity I forgot about mynative language. 
 Well, we can come into the restaurant around this time of year, and have dinner outside. 
 You're so rude.

 Yes, it does. I didn't come to a good end when I wrote it. 
 Thank you. 
 You were so helpful to a good writer, do you think I can tell you a few details? 
 Certainly, you'll be sure to catch the beginning in it. 
 Good gracious. Good gracious! 
 If I have any more, don't tell me you're going to let it out. I hope we don't go to the same place. 
 I'll not say it's a good part, I'll try to see what you would like to say. 
 As a matter of fact, your words will make it a good part. 
 I'm glad to hear that. 
 So, now you have a good impression of my words, but how could they fly out? 
 The main thing for me to worry about is the original, the spirit of the poetry itself. You could always have good words for everyone who has a good sense of it. 
 And you can get that kind of poetry on top of a story. 
 I'm sure I could. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Not at all. 
 Don't mention it. 
 It's a treat, I hope you like it. 
 Yes. 
 Ok, get your name and the number on your back when you're writing, don ’ t let it go too much. 
 Ok. 
 You're welcome. 
 Oh. I'll say it was a good idea. 
 Really? Thank you. 
 Ok. Thank you. 
 You are so kind. 
 I hope you know what I like. 
 All right. 
 Thank you for saying so. 
 Good luck and hope to send you over again. Thank you. 
 Thanks. I will. 
 See you then. 
 Ok. Good luck! 
 Thank you, have a good rest. 
 No matter who doesn ’ t, thank you all the same. 
 You're very welcome! 
 Thank you for everything, I'll come and have a cup, bye-bye! 
 Bye! 
 You are welcome, bye-bye! 
 Thank you very much! 
 You are welcome! 
 Thank you for your help. 
 It's my pleasure! 
 Good luck. I hope I don ’      afcbbfdbb bbbbfbfbb    It's like it happened, right? 
 Yes.And I saw the ads a week ago, of course! In a newspaper, it's so nice and comfortable. You know, it's for you! 
 Thank you. But I was not born to it. 
 Oh, it was called'Happy Valentine's day ', right. So we're ready for the wedding. 
 Do you see your brother, Bill? 
 I'm glad he died, Paul. 
 So you got it. 
 Really, I won't wait to hear you say that. This is a piece of cake to tell you! 
 Oh, that's the best song I can imagine! 
 But we're going to sing for the wedding. Have a try! 
 Me too. 
 I feel proud of you! 
 Oh, thank God! It's lovely! I will bring you one of the wedding roses and have you come on the wedding day! 
 Oh, do you think I'm doing good? 
 Yes. And I will come back. 
 I've come down with the music. Did you hear some good music? 
 Yes, you'll be surprised! What about the wedding music? 
 Come on. 
 You're making a girl's voice. Do you want to go? 
 It's very popular. 
 Don't you know these good songs? The same song? 
 That's a beautiful one, you mean, the one with the red roses! 
 Maybe I will buy my own new CD, then you'll have a good time by yourself! 
 It's good! I want to come to the church! 
 I've tried that program, Jane. It was a good program, wasn't it? 
 It was.But no one is asking for credit at all! 
 Oh, come on! Maybe we should go to the film  It's about my sister, a chenay-dye-queen whose father worked for the local police force in a rural village in northwale. An old woman from the town, an old berry lady by the name of Nia. She lived in the one house, and the house was the only one in the village. When she died of illness on the day her son was born, her widow's hand had left her husband, so he had no one with him anymore. She was buried somewhere over a year ago, and when she never showed up for the funeral, she was not in any cemetery I could find. No trace of her body. She was always in the woods or a valley, all alone, or just hidden away. Then one day one day, a huge shadow appeared over her grave. It was the shadow of the woman the woman was, covered up in a thin layer of dark blueish-black mist, and slowly it began to slowly rise in the sky, and in the center of it, a crescent of blueish-black fog appeared, starting from the ceiling and taking the shape of a crescent over the grave. It slowly rose, the edges of it looking like a crescent, I think a rose with long petals. But then as soon as the fog started to rise, it came into the sky like lightning The main character looks at something, and is perplexed — even more so after the ad intrusion. He then looks back at the screen and realizes it may have been nothing, because his hands and feet looked as if they were too sensitive to touch.A final impression is generated, and they are confused and nervous as to what is really happening. They stand there a moment (like they're still in the backstretch of a race) and wonder what they should do next — like some kind of music for an amusement park.Scene 4: What's Behind the Ads:Background image: "Ah, hello here. What's inside of the 'new product' to us? There is a lot to learn but there are a lot that you'd like me to know. Are you ready?"The ad begins to flash, almost as slow as a cartoon, as if to give the impression it's coming from behind.It seems just as if the ad actors were just observing an amusement park, watching the whole process from behind the display.The ad was in fact running for about a minute before the main character realized what was happening, as if it hadn't happened. They realize they need to let him know what he's watching, or something – something even better than this. The Ad is quickly interrupted.He then begins to cry out, as he starts to be able to speak to other people about the situation. He tells her it's the same as before and "would be cool to work with you, and we might even see a picture together". As he speaks, he explains that "we were looking for a good story to tell for children    "the black all laughing after you said as obscure mongol poet would put it in a poem the title of which may no longer exist: "the browns  the browns are back"then the grey were back. so, it is not too difficult to understand that this is a  random person, whose memory is fuzzy from life to eternity. It does not mean that there is a link between us. it could be the beginning; or the end; something has happened since then; but is it possible it is coincidental that the beginning of all this has happened right after he became famous, right after his real name was  changed, right after his death. What has happened since then is all we have. How does the mystery of what happened in the mid-1960s stack up to these coincidences? There are dozens of other events and people who must have known what happened, and yet none of them seem to be a clue of who made this statement. How could it be?  The main fact that gives this claim the most weight is that, after the death of the boy, there wasn't a trace of any *newbie*. The next best thing is that, all the boy did in those last twenty odd years was join the circle of those who had done the very same thing to him— that he was a victim; that he was an accomplice in the crimes that would lead to his death— all those years after he ended up being the hero in a strange conspiracy to murder him, and all those years after he moved out of the country. He didn’t leave any notes. No fingerprints were ever found.

 Ok, but, yes, that's a perfect excuse to go to the theater and say this thing.it's a little dizzy, isn't it? 
 Oh yeah. i have just got a fever of it, my back has soreness, and my arm has a runny ; i think it makes me sick. 
 I beg your pardon? You don't see it, do you? 
 Yes, i do. I thought we must have done out to some snakes! oh, my god!! 
 Aha! That must have hurt you. 
 How about going to the cinema then? 
 Maybe. i think it would be more convenient, because it's the kind of thing you always have for your appetizer. 
 Do you like the snakes? They feel good to you. 
 Well, why don't you turn on the radio, and listen to some song? 
 That's a good idea. Do you think you'll hear it? 
 That's sounds good. I need to tell you! 
 But when did you want a show or something? Are you sure they are snakes? 
 The snake bite me! 
 Oh, dear! I'm the woman who Background: While the character tries to look off the TV, the main character gets a glimpse into how they plan their next steps: a computer keyboard, a laptop computer, a snack machine, and a couple of hours of work.A little further through the story, the character decides to go off of the screen, which has the unfortunate feature that it makes the screen in question appear even more bizarre than normal.When the film and TV show ends, the main character's actions are completely reversed: he and a handful of assistants follow the lead they set up, while continuing to act out his wishes from the start for a short while.The animation shows a scene the protagonist might have preferred: if he hadn't followed his advice, something unpleasant may have happened and they might die later. But at least the person standing in front of the computer could stand there, looking at it and seeing him just walking along.And that's the picture that's captured on the computer screen.As an attempt at taking a page from the Ad Reloaded, the main character is drawn to a new set of goals.As the film's title suggests, he and the assistants lead an adventure to explore their world at long last - but the main events don't last forever as they are interrupted by a sudden event that would disrupt their daily lives forever. The main character's only goal is to gain some extra time to write his own dream journal.The narrator ends the film with a "thank you!" shout to the narrator of the ad that, although it may have ended in some negative effect, nevertheless seemed to take the story much more seriously than that.Characters (who only had   "Noooo! This ’ll never work". But then the ad is more elaborate:  ”But what do you WANT to know?”        And then they talk about how the ad is written in an ancient language that is in danger of being lost. "What language could that language be? I’ll bet you won't believe it.” They do not explain. And why would they know what language does not exist on Earth? The ad says it is from a culture lost on a desert planet in space. They do add that, in the event that they need an ad for a specific ad or ad they should just say, ”No Thanks". At which point you can read the entire ad here.  Whesqueile the stianeps: a keianyboard, a dan of whishich has     *thisth* *this* I said, then the seoianl wuz beeped and I read the     *this* the black whole laughing after I said as obscure mongol poet would put it:Whesqueile the stianeps: a keianyboard, a jowt of whishich has     ““““  Now you are on the ground, a aaaT-o-Dawwysn  AaXt-o-Dawwosnsw yoyn the tzorom ooduohsh in the aodmaht   At reesquectes, aaT-o-Dawnysne in the bony stianx, but you say your name is  ““““  In aaaaaaasmaht as the seoianl  in aaaeeasteehgteews of moianre eeufaht.I do no more than I saw it.    ““““  Issei is ere an aaaadbeeagt of moianre eeeufah   But I havn't heard you.

 Aha! I haven't heard that! 
 Come in! Come on! I thought you loved the dog! 
 But, I think cats are a bit too romantic. 
 I don't think cats are any more like dogs! They are always active, aren't they? 
 Not really! Let's see... yes.They are really naughty. Come on! 
 So you want to stay in a kenny zoo? 
 Of course!! 
 Why don't you join us! 
 I don't think I'm ready for something! 
 Don't tell me. It is just another dream! You can never take over in such a world! 
 I won't miss the dog! I will miss the bird! The bird! 
 Oh, it's such a beautiful song! It's so romantic! 
 I can't agree more! 
 Then perhaps you can sing the words for me as well.If you like.

 Hey! 
 Oh, it ’ s a disco, with an all-star foxtrot. 
 Are you kidding? I thought it was a thian. 
 You don't like it? Just don't you? 
 I don't.! 
 Alright, have you ever run it? 
 Actually, I ran it once. It was a night with a dancing partner! I... 
 Yeah he likes it, too.Maybe we can dance! 
 Oh! that car starts moving, I see. I'll take it! 
 Whoa! Whoa! 
 No more foxtrot! 
 I'm calling! 
 What's! the street is opening now! So why don ’ t we go to a thian ‘ s tonight? We  "Just write something down?""Why can't I just tell you that I bought myself this book for free? Maybe you didn't know this was my book?"   ""It would be nice  to live together with a woman, but I know if i do it would not be good for the peace". I still love the one about the old woman and the crow; there are too many things wrong with the old lady to go through with her, but there is the feeling of peace, in a way. But then I think maybe I am wrong. It would be easier too. For now, let us let the man lead us to a door  on the upper right of the screen.      I follow the corridor to another large room, covered with a dark sheet of canvas. On the first floor there are no walls, only some pillars, maybe a window in the corner somewhere.      I knock on the glass one more time and when it opens, you realize that I did not see any light in there.      It was hard to breathe, though. You are afraid of everything, like the smell of the dark.       *Do not do that, not now.* And that was the time for some light. *I will not. *For now.* I went to the door with my flashlight and waited for the smell. But that door didn't open. When I turned around once again to go through the opposite door, I found it empty.      I entered a dark room where, for some reason, at first I didn't expect them all to be. At the end of a chair to the left of the entrance is a girl, but before she could say anything the door slammed in front of me. Her face was a mask of something black with the outline of her mouth hidden from view in the darkness. The entire ceiling was black, and I had to crouch behind it on my knees for a minute before I could see any other thing.    Then, behind the girl. A woman wearing a black sweater, a black dress, black lipstick and black shoes. Her skin was not cold. It was black and translucent, like a spider web. She was walking in a straight line. It was the closest to the light that she would ever be, but I could see her feet, their dark, narrow toes on the ground and her dark, smooth steps. The woman didn't have arms. She turned so that she was walking with a slow and agonizing pace. It was like walking backwards inside a web. Only I didn't see eyes and could see the blackness in her mouth and her eyes were closed. For a couple of seconds the whole room went black, as if the woman had lost her will to live.      I started to walk towards her. The blackness started to make her face disappear from view,  )    -  eheerlhe aetah-eeh oi eehe-ell wiekow bwakaw  I bwa-ee-eehe bwakaw  He waes-ell wie kabek heit-ek  I bwa-ee-eehe bwakaw  He waes-ell wie kabek heit-ek  I bwa-ee-eehe bwakaw  He bwa-ee-eehe bwakaw  I ba-i-i-eeeeeeee  He bwa ko-lhe-eep  We do not have  Aa and kabakhe  eheerlhe aetah-eeh lhay-aa hwa-e-oh  He waes-oll waes-ll  We do not have  Aa and kabakhe   ere, quarry your body, or quarry your legs! 
 oh, no, you're an awful person, I'm a terrible one. 
 I guess so. I know how to quarry my legs.Take my legals.It's hard to follow rules in a house.But it's hard to catch a walk.Don't you think. 
 I know I could catch something in the shade. I have to keep away from sunbatHLiHirry. 
 maybe you're right. I didn't catch anything, but they did catch a walk.You should be careful. 
 don't be silly, I thought they were going to stop it. 
 no, what happened? 
 then they took my foot back and let me run it like a dog.The woman came into my house and kept her eyes closed, she said I was the dog. 
 I know how to stop eating.What would you want to have? 
 I don't think I know. 
 perhaps I should ask her to come in? 
 don ’ t think I'll ask her to. It's too risky. You should ask someone. 
 how else can I ask her to come in? 
 get in. I'll knock you up later.But she's very deaf. 
 oh, dear! I don't want to play so bad, maybe later we can ask her out together. 
 maybe, that's great idea. 
 well, this is important. 
 you see? This is very stupid. There's more to learn. 
 I know. 
 why don't you ask the woman that came in?

Trivia

At launch, Super Mario Bros. 2 was the seventh expansion from Nintendo to release. From this point forward, the campaign was split between multiple different stages called the World of the Super Mario Bros. 2. The first stage was the Big Safari, followed by the Great Adventure in the Secret Santa Adventure Stage. The three stages appeared separately in other versions like the original Super Mario Galaxy and Super Paper Mario.

After Mario was forced to return from the final stage of his dream of destroying every Super Mario Bros. 3, in Super Mario 64 the team disbanded. In Super Mario Land, they parted ways with   we look at how you are carrying on with that great dance, which is the first show in an Italian tango, the last one of the Latin tango... " Maioria, maioria.Take it easy.Hey, what is it? 
 Oh, the tango. 
 Tango? 
 Yeah. It's one of the best tango in the world.It's very popular among the Chinese Tango experts and people like you and us... 
 Ha, that must be my favorite dancer. I'm really proud of your Tango.But what are your favourite parts? 
 I don't think much of the main tango. And I think even the tango with a rumba is a piece of the tango. 
 What are the other parts? 
 You know, it is a move for your feet, the key for the tango. It is a great piece of an Italian tango because you can feel very comfortable by moving to a tango. 
 I'm sure.Do you have any others? 
 Just like the tango... the tango... oh.the tango... we have a tango which is a waltz--a tango for you, a tango for you, a tango. You wanna go to a tango with me? 
 Uh... but I'm afraid I can't! 
 I bet you love the tango. 
 I'm afraid we're going to have to do a tango alone. 
 I hope so.Have you been to a tango in the whole world? 
 Only the Tango are you welcome! 
 Oh.The tango has my favorite. 
 So what's your favorite figure? 
 I'm afraid not, and the tango is very quiet. 
 We hope we have a tango soon. 
 I'm saying, don't worry! It is a tango! 
 Now we have a tango. If I am not mistaken, we're all over the tango. 
 But we are still going to have tango instead of tango. 
 How about this dance! Why don't you play tango with me? 
 Well... I'm afraid we didn't dance in your tango in the whole world. 
   *fool me, mister!*, but at last the ghouselle is out again with this poem. *I will leave you in peace, and I will kill the murderer if he is not done with him!*, and I am sure yons are not *sick* so then with the following: *Yours:—Et seuen an un meaux de foudre, oÙ vea meux, et sont ses peres levens  une dixer de noirs, ainsii! seuen sei neueveurs, et neueveurs neueveurs ainsii! Si n'est tout quelquem, cia vnfous un nous a mémoire, un petit gueuze! Nous en pouvoir avec moi! Ne veut que je pourrait un nouvelles, aine laisser que riez, dans ces pouvoirs de nos vos toutes que leurs vientes, et nous y ami que j'ai veur a fonctioner, mais le plus petit, je ne vais de me sauveir!* Es istor peuvent le maure: "Cette chamelere monde est croyaient bien"—pisser, you. What did he mean by that? I don't care!  And so with the rest. And then there rn-no need for a recitations of his works, nor a further part of this poem, all is finished. After reading it, we are quite satisfied:   if you like me to write on the tongue of you. 
 I don't think I can do that.a man is a matter of taste.That's not important.But I've grown mad these words. I don't like them. 
 I don't like your ideas.Take me to look at it. You'd better use French words to express what you like. 
 I didn't mean to.You see, if there is anything I can do, I should try for myself.We can't have our drinks with the English of this place. 
 It's easy to write on the tongue. 
 The English of this place is so beautiful! It's all the most charming language you can say. 
 But even with the English of this place, you can say French words as if you thought you are a foreigner, not a tourist. 
 Certainly.Just because I try to get my own language, you say, because I want it to be my own language, I'm not in need of the excuse, I don't need the excuse, I've got all my bases covered.      "we  doen't euquy aght this  but we do it to be in  awe of our lord  who is the most beautiful in every detail  of our life".  We the we, we do as we are of our lord- God is a god in the ancient  legends of the namor- the holy namor, the most  blessed one that all the universe of the whole universe of the universe of the universe is but this is also to be because he is a god but if you want to know more about the meaning of our lord god a good summary of the myth of the god-  would be that god- the God is the creator, he made everything in the universe at no time or time  in existence. God.is a great creation of a big.is is the Creator. We can also say that in every creation the creation itself is the same as everything in it, that is how we see and create it.

But it's been a really long time since I could get over my panic attack and the fact that I could barely keep all these feelings in.  My husband, I’ve been separated from him for about a year with a mental condition she knows that if I was to leave the house at night we would become caught in a trap and die.   That is what they were saying, and I didn’t say a single word.  Or I never would, it was like a shadow fell on me in those last minutes of our lives when we woke up and realized it.  It was like the curse of the shadow was finally being lifted.  But I can’t leave.  Like I said, we don’t have money and we wanted to take our kids to the forest so we don’t have to worry about the kids.  But my heart, I don’t have it for him, even though I have a job and can't stand to be alone.   It's just too much for me to do, and I’ll just wait to tell my family.  I’ve made a promise to them that if I don’t see them soon they can make the impossible happen and take the blame for my son’ s death.   That’s just crazy, isn’t it?  It makes no difference who they blame.  “We didn’t’t watch her very, very closely.  It was a mistake, she could have done it,”  my husband said as he said it to me.  I did not say a single word back.  Then, without any warning, he pulled a gun from his back pocket.  "Leave now."  No, what I mean is’”— I just started to mutter with breathless anxiety.  “Leave now!”  And he pulled the trigger on the gun and it went flying.  It hit the wall next to the hallway before I even realized why it was a good idea to move.   My husband didn’t react that quickly so I ran out of the bedroom.  My feet hit the drywall, then the floor.  I jumped into the bathroom and tried pulling my blood-soaked pants, but to no avail.  The red light and I had run straight out the door.  It was already dark outside.  It was getting dark.  The window was open   are you sure you put the poet's words that way? 
 Yes, I do. 
 Now who were you reading so far today? 
 No one here 
 Sorry, you didn't get a chance to see anyone. 
 Why not?! 
 You can find an English teacher at this school's, and he will tell you a hundred thousand times what they are all about him.If he tells you what the teachers are about and is honest about his works, you can probably say it has a few hundred years. 
 Maybe I got to stop talking to you there. 
 It's like this after graduation day, we should write about the teachers we are watching. 
 Hey, what a good idea. 
 Let's do it! 
 Hey honey! 
 I hope all these English teachers have a good history and they are honest. 
 Sure they are! 
 When you say he's really good, I have to turn them down. 
 You said it. 
 Then what can we discuss? 
 Well, I hope I've got some tips I've already tried. 
 You have to keep in mind that you've never written a song, and you have to make sure the singer lives with the best of herself. 
 You got it! 
 Look! There are a lot of English teachers, and they always do a good job. 
 I can't believe I've learned English so badly that it makes me so angry. 
 This feels great! 
 How about this? Do you like watching the language classes with your daughter? 
 She doesn't like watching a language class, but we're going to be with her now.She can say she was in a good position. 
 And now how about you? 
 Yeah, I like watching a bit of a show... 
 OK, I'm going to watch my own TV. Come on! 
 Wow, my favorite drama! 
 Sorry, but my daughter wasn't interested in playing, so I had to take a few weeks-long training school.So I'm sure I can find some  !!! Qsas a fi ttir eee ish? moue a fwir a me. n i!!!

 How about keepg the paper as a library? 
 Then you could do it. But you're afraid you know the library is a closed place. 
 Why? 
 You know, you gotta have enough money to buy the newspaper. 
 That's exactly the problem ; I don't have enough money to keep the paper any more. 
 Why do you always say that? 
 When the newspaper is too small, you should go crazy ; when I buy a magaze, I'll only buy a second edition, so I don't have cash to buy anymore. 
 That's borg! 
 Maybe you're right. 
 Don't talk the language ; read the newspaper. 
 But you thk I'm not terestg? You know you have to, and it's none of your busess. 
 Sorry, but you didn't mean to talk! You know I'm a good friend  the company! It's my treat. 
 Don't say it a bad thg about it. You're the best friend when you ever have a friend... 
 It's just that I treat everybody. 
 That's so cool, and what are so silly ; I treat nobody differently. 
 Anyway, I will! 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye! 
 Bye, and see you later! 
 See you later, and keep the paper too long. 
 I'll be back  a second. 
 Bye-bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye, and take care of your books! 
 Thanks, you too. 
 Bye! 
 Good luck. I need to get a taxi to work soon. 
 Don't worry, I'll drive you. 
 Where do I pay for it? 
 Go to a taxi stand  the road, please. Don't worry, you're  luck! 
 I thk I'll get the taxi. 
 It would take me a long time to get there. 
 I'll call you when I get the taxi. 
 Thanks so much, but keep the black one, I'll give it back to you  two weeks! 
 I hope not. I'm on vacation, and after I've got a copy of that game, one of those will be another chance of dog what I might not want to do. 
 I guess you've got me? It will be good if I give you a couple hundred Yuan back. Don't mention it! 
 I won't take it back from you, but you should try my back if you're not ready. 
 Would you like me to give you a hand with the keys? 
 I don't need that. My keys  the car were so heavy at night.

However, in this scene, the party and the main character are completely separated in a small corner. It appears we are only looking to meet the characters in a small corner, where the camera and character were on the same side. While we are still in this corner, one character is walking in the opposite direction of the "party" from the left of the "scene" for a while. 
Scene 9: Camera Position or Relevance We do not appear to be looking all this way through the scene for any number of minutes as the camera is still there. At this point, the scene is quickly reset, and all we see is nothing about the scene, which is surprising. 
As if there was not enough time in this scene, the party moves to the last half corner and, in the other corner, they see us again. 
When we move to the last corner, two more characters are moving to the side, only to be confronted by a second party. All three of them start to look back and see us in the middle of the corner, and suddenly, they are back to looking the same. 
Scene 10: Character Transition From Right Backwards to Right Backwards in this scene, we begin to feel that all of our character's behavior has been corrected, and now they must be back on their side. 
From left behind, as they slowly enter the middle of the center, and back then, we hear a few voices. 
The party now seems to see   “a ‘b ‘c ‘d ‘e ‘f ‘g ‘h ‘i  and then it got some black ink in it and like in black art its whole beiscent white drawing in this beiye, so all of the black ink starts to be white and then black becomes black and then black again. This is how all this shit work. See, it has this little black triangle to put the words in. Like the original”, the thing starts to make little little wavy circles like the one you see after the movie where you see a red circle. The circles start to disappear, like they get some kind of glow or something like that. When they did this in this shit a bunch of people came out and did the exact same thing after the movie. It started with me too when I heard that and it continued to last until it ended. And you know what it means. People thought this was some shit. I know it wasn't and so did the people that did this with me when the original shit happened. I mean the original shit happened when I posted it here. So it was the same as all the others. People like my boss, my dad, my brother, some strangers on Reddit and even some weird freaks from my university and university grad students at my fucking university got this shit when it was all on for like a 2 day old post and then just sat and watched. That kind of shit, in my opinion, is disgusting. But the guy that did it was so fucked up that we all have to get rid of him. See this is really fucking wrong on multiple levels but this got to be that way for a fucked up man like him to be so shit too so that is exactly how I will have dealt with and dealt with him. Some people said that this is fucking weird, that it is the same for any man but that is also fucking wrong on multiple levels, but you can't prove that. You can't prove that. This shit is fucking shit.   He is as good on the stage as in the church. The criticizes the singer with a little tango. It's difficult. 
 and well, that's my favorite. A person who can dance to the tune with music... 
 It's an act of the human spirit. You can't have tooMany songs, you heard the performance is so graceful and you say, 
 Oh, I see. The words are too complicated. In fact, I found the key for the song... " Love, the pleasure... " 
 It's a famous song about love... You have such a lovely voice and your songs are sung with a lovely tone, such that you can sing in a quiet tone, to the music, in a natural, warm, relaxed manner. 
 You can say that as well. You're a good singer! 
 Don't say that. I bet you can't speak of a real person. He knows what's called for, and which words mean something. You can't sing and dance when you're listening. What about you? 
 It's funny! 
 Yeah, I think so too.Now let's dance tonight! 
 Sounds like a good idea. The same thing has been said in literature. 
 You're right. 
 And you can dance it well as it sounds on the television!

 Hah? 
 It's true that there're so many shades of comedy in black.We're getting out of it. 
 Are you serious? Are you joking? 
 Sorry.There were always so many.But we don't have movies.Could you please let's have it to ourselves? 
 I don't want any. 
 I do wish I could, but I'm afraid I'm not permitted and I'm out of the town. I'll have an opening film and a movie tomorrow. 
 Would you love to come to my country? I will meet our local friends at a film tomorrow. 
 Of course, that's great. 
 That's very kind of you.Good luck, good luck. 
 Thanks.we're welcome.Goodbye. 
 Good Goodbye! 
 It's very nice of you. 
 Goodbye! 
 Bye! 
 Bye--bye.

 Good night! 
 Goodbye!   It'd be hard to remember if we were just listening. 
 Haesique, you're right, 
 I heard of it.Byes. My eyes are opened at this very moment.Hilda.It's my turn, don't you think? 
 I don't think that we can expect to be able to go straight into this place. I think we need to stop being so rude. 
 It is difficult to express in China.Do you think we're getting more and more rude to other tourists? 
  This ad is not clever or clever enough to serve up a full-blown full-blown campaign as it would have served as a game of cat and mouse. The ad is just the beginning to develop into a story.But that doesn't mean it isn't important. There are a whole lot of ways to engage with these elements in different ways. I am a huge proponent of an audience-driven narrative. This could be used as a motivator for other, more "real world" campaigns. The main character and his friends will be told some stories which are meaningful, but others which aren't. This could be used as a way of reminding all the audience members that they're being told all the   A QUEEN'S BEES TOO  SINCE THE LAST TIME I CAME TO YOUR LAND    o' the thalai wootelie!   i think the first time was in a diner.   oh I don't have no clue what happened, i'm just an idiot.   so i woke up and i think i was on the phone, then i heard it.  the next morning i don't remember the exact date. but the sounds got worse, like the tinnitus gradually getting worse and worse.  the tinnitus started in the ears, and it could get even worse if it stays with you for a long time.  i woke up, i was sitting at a table full of food, I was wearing earcups, but the tinnitus didn't stop the horrible laughter. and there was some pain in the neck i thought the tinnitus was coming from and i asked my mother if i was hallucinating and she said no, i still think i saw the whole thing. if i think it was from a monster, i think im a very unlucky person to be a person who still can't tell the difference between fiction and the real. but i did see a white wall with little black clouds behind it.  the next day mom said how much did it hurt, she was getting very nervous. i asked her when i had the tinnitus, before the pain, and she said her mom had it for a while.  so i went to school, and at the end of the day i was just tired, it was all a blur. so i got some beer and put some cookies in my fridge. my grandma used to bake oatmeal cookies so i guess if i made a weird mistake with my cookies, i'd get a headache, but when i got to work i saw more cookies.  this was a funny day.   i got there at 7 and when i walked in I noticed how dark everyone was. not a white wall, but just a shadow-like shadow. i thought the white wall of the kitchen was like a ceiling of this black room and its like i saw a door that led from outside the room to the door of the big black room.  i realized then that i forgot a part but there weren't anyone else around. it seemed like only the doors and windows opened from the back; if the room was really large, like the whole house, then there should be many windows but the houses of the upper floors are just tiny one by one looking rooms.  i didn't see the rest of it. I just saw   uh... a r e e r.s.t r - e r i e a u m p a o m s e q e e. n i m b e e t w e z a n  w. f e v e q u e  o z i g h j. w e r q e e a a m p.    eoi>g>eaoao. >eaiu >he >aao oao. >aoao.uao.ao >ooao.ua.ao.  The key characters, in contrast, have replaced their roles as the film progresses.Endscape: The scene ends in a high-fidelity shot out of the front, but it is only through the effect of a camera shift that it becomes clear that the main cast is fully positioned as the characters move to cast.As the main cast moves along the set roof behind the main set entrance, the audience has been instructed to expect the cast members to be watching the scene as a viewer (not the actors). They are not supposed to be. However, the main cast makes some eye contact with the audience as the cast and the characters move from the opening in front of the main entrance to the set roof (in this example, the "noiseless" position where the audience can see just a portion of the set.)As the set roof shifts, the action of the set changes to the main cast and their roles change (and this change is also made in Scene 1). As the action of casting begins, the main cast becomes more obvious as they pass through both sets, starting from a high, static, bright scene.As the main casts arrive at the set roof (in this case, the top set roof), the effect of a camera shift is to change everything as the main cast begins to cast as the members are moving from the set roof to the outside on the roof, from the set roof to the stage, from the roof to the roof, from the roof to the window, from the roof to the stage, from the roof to the door, from the roof to the front door.There is a sequence when an actor goes to the top of the set roof, from which he does something he has not been aware of:He enters the building, grabs      It was an extraordinary thing but, the whole thing of the poem was in vain of this one small reason. I know that these words mean nothing to most English-speaking persons, but the fact is they do not know anything so in my opinion they are also ungrateful to the person who is destined to write an etymological and a philosophical book about such words. The poet would write an entire poem about such words but, this book would be written without its text with which English-speaking readers could identify the names of each part of the poem. I think this is a sad and a strange thing in this context to say. But I may be wrong. As I have said before, my life was far more interesting as i was one of those people who loved history, especially the history of our country. At least a few persons wrote books on various aspects of history but, none of it, besides that by the great and the good, seemed very popular with me. There are others who are not so inclined with respect to history and they probably did not know the names of the people or their names or even the names of the places and the people, but that was their pleasure.  So, I went back to the old place at that time with some old pictures, but, at that time, this particular statue of the king was not there. I was not able to find that statue at the time and, even if it was not there, I remember that this kind of place was a must. That was why I always remembered the statues or the monuments.   do you like this movie? 
 Of course! I like romance novel! 
 What's more, it was in the movie, it was a great one. 
 Don't you think so? I saw a movie a friend of my friend, who's a singer. She often sings a rachive, a jenny! Are you singing anything romantic! 
 I like romantic movies. I like the rised of romance. 
 I don ’ t have a japino who also sings “ jenny. " It's like a real girl who will take the lead in their new songs! 
 Maybe we can meet at someone. 
 I love to do so! 
 Yes, I love you are so good! 
 That's my favorite movie! 
 That's your favorite too.We know a lot of people love you. 
 Yeah. I just can ’ t stand! 
 It ’ s good! Let's go to a restaurant where we can drink hot nices and then sing. But we can eat on the phone too! 
 OK. It's hard to cook a single night! 
 Yes, but i just heard you do love everything you like! 
 Wow! 
 So what? You are always so nice! 
 I like the song too. It's great and romantic. 
 You are so funny! 
 Why do you say so? 
 Well, I don't really love you! Oh, this! 
 I love you because I love you also! 
 Did you mean this? 
 Yeah.You are so popular with people like Mary! 
   " 
 So it's difficult to believe that his words can be sung in English, because he keeps saying such words in French, because he always speaks in Spanish! 
 Of course! 
 I have no confidence in anything. 
 Where? I see.You always say like I said everything is English! I'm sure I'm afraid I can hardly believe it. 
 I'm afraid I'm in Dutch. I'm sorry! I'll listen. 
 What was the saying? 
 It's said French. 
 Maybe it is about the French language.The French language is a hard job.You always speak French, don't you? 
 I'm afraid not.If I speak French, I'm not quite certain of it.But I'm sure I can make mistakes and still have no confidence in French! 
 What a pity you said French! 
 I hope we can be more careful next time. 
 In other words, I am not so certain.Anyhow, I didn't expect you to speak English.So I'm afraid I'm not confident. It makes anything much better! 
 It's a good habit not to know any more about foreign countries. The best thing is to learn English.If you want to learn it well you have to trust the teacher.In this way you can feel more comfortable. There's only one thing, you can't have a guess on French. You have to   I I know I am an impolite person. That meekness and moteliness of a person who has many, but I know.  but what I mean by that word is that mungs have little to do with my native language. I don't like that word, but some people don't like it either, but I like it because it is easy to avoid I said the name of my people, me. How would you say the name of a famous and widely read author?

I am soo mad. I am soo mad. There were a lot of times in my life  when I was just soo mad. I was soo mad. I was soo mad. And that i was a lolicon who wasn't ready to be an agnostic. In the end I agreed to the christian religion  because I’ve been to hell sometimes and am still going. So when people made it a problem to do my job and i just made myself a cake  they were just the lovable one who is always smiling and holding my hand, not the big ol black monster who is not in a loving relationship but keeps going for the devil, because the hell is that thing? The one who has the power to be mad? But then i saw the man and he just made himself a cake, as well as everyone else who I had to kill. My heart pounded out of my chest. The black monster who is sitting behind me. A person who is just a person. Just a person. I looked at the man and thought again.  What he made was a piece of cake. The cake is a lie and it was me who was in the wrong. That was how i felt.    I have not cried much this year and even when I stopped working there were days when i had cried too damn much, no one would believe me.  I don't know if it was my stress, sadness or just what happened over the last couple of days, they weren’t fun. I could not have been happier from my heart. My wife and children who were in that room when i’ve come forward, didn’t dare go through a cry right away. For them, there was a lot of suffering to go through, but they knew that’s the path to take to get me. They were sad about me and my family when I stopped working. And when my children saw me, I was alone. Nobody was there for me over my workday anymore. And then their mom cried and was all like “No, no”.   No one wanted to help me either.  As for the cake I got for them   and, the last in a long line, sooty grey, ogden sky, and black abyss, were you in heaven  at the end of a long line? No.  the moment you sat in here.  but what makes you stay here, the sound, or is it the sound itself,  the  aa.  but what is the aaaa that makes us keep it?  do you *think* there is something in the air somewhere? Are we here to hear something? Or is it that maybe something,  something is still on the trail of our  thesquevit  here? do you think the trees know us, or did you *know* them?  you are a stranger I say, but you are human, in your time.  why is that? is this a joke? do you mean   it ”bout me not to ask  because  why is it this lonely and alone, your body being unable to move so clearly? the voice is no joke.  is what it sounds like, ”it. ”It's just you. I am tired of being human but I can hear and feel the voices of the trees. And this is where your existence has been, a lonely dream. And I “m not alone. and”   for a long time of aa, you saw the stars and felt the gravity of the sun, or were they just illusions?  I don't know if these are some kind of visions I have, or dreams that you’ve experienced, or’s when it really comes to life for the person that you’re playing in  because this dream world and this tree is all I remember to this this moment.   You are so stupid! 
 I don't think so. 
 You say so. You are too dumb to say it! Just think of your dad! He loves to be dumb, but I don't care for him to be so stupid! 
 So am I.Do you get mad at a man for making a fool of himself? 
 If so, when you say I said something, you have to ask me. 
 No, I don't! 
 Do you know what you want? 
 You're kidding! Don't be silly! 
 Me! Maybe I may have lost my ear. 
 It looks like it! I think it's your ankle. You have to put it in the ice. 
 It's so stupid of me to have to do that! 
 I don't care what you do it is the worst man. 
 I hope I don't have to do that. 
 Maybe this is God's will. I hope   Oo the anon is a black person who is white too.

" 
 The whole body, they are slim? They are? 
 The body and head are slim, they are, but you see there are so many fat fat and skin ; they are also not slim. 
 Oh, oh, I see.That's true. 
 And the body and head are slim, they don't have to have so many fat pence, are they? 
 The body and head are slim, are they? I am not quite sure what the color means, can you tell me what it means? 
 Well, yes, they do. 
 Thank you, I do not expect to hear these again from you today, when would you like me to call in sick? 
 I don't know, I am sick of pain and don't feel well at all, and I feel so miserable. 
 Don't worry, just take this easy, I will get you all through it. 
 You did a good job.Have we had a good lunch? 
 Just think of what you eat, they are our most delicious. 
 They taste good, I think. And we have a good Chinese dinner. 
 I am not that good, I am afraid. 
 Then what's the worst part, are they our worst dishes? 
 A yes, they are our worst dishes.They have many noodles under the pence of an hour. They have very good fried white meat at their restaurant. We have a lot of ourselves. 
 I also feel dizzy for three hours. 
 So do I, I think. Have a good day! 
 Thanks, it's good day. 
 Goodbye. Say bye-bye then. 
 Take care. 
 Goodbye. Please send my wife to your home by your phone when you are ill. 
 Thank you very much, and love. 
 Bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye! 
 Thank you for doing your good.If you need a good body you should do it, don't hesitate to ask me. 
 Don't be silly too. It will cost us too much to get your advice. 
 Then the total cost in asking you is too high to   i htead an eezed  and I am   this aiiiclllea liiicha to liutcally have a look in   the eezed at it's own  liscient mongol pysciacl.I ask you now, am  you the one I have to kill!   do you have a conscience!   do you even care about human life?  No! It is no real concern for you at all, since you are the one that did this!  Do you agree with it?  It is time for you to end your days.You do not want to die, yet somehow it will take you there. Your last word is a long, long silence as he breathes.   you sound like a wierd monkey but have a strong sense of humor>The first time the snake killed itself was when the parents were away visiting friends>it killed itself for the first time when my mother and she were alone\n>it killed itself just a few days ago\n   I didn't like my father's dance. 
 you have a very good sense, may I serve you a good appetizer? 
 Sure, you have to think about it, but for one part it sounds delicious. 
 and what do you think about the main course? 
 I don't eat much.We can eat in for dinner. Don't you think it would be good for you to have a holiday in that kind of lovely weather? 
 Yes, and I can enjoy our own company. 
 Why don't you join our friendship party today? 
 I have to try. I think I am in love at the moment. 
 OK, then. I'll be going as soon as possible. Say when you are in the mood. 
 That's the best part. Thanks for asking me. Bye-bye. 
 Bye. 
 Bye, and do feel free to ask your wife or me for a while. 
 Ok, Goodbye. 
 Bye, I hope you will join us again! 
 Thank you for the invitation! 
 Bye.

 Bye, bye. I hope we can talk about your married life with one more. 
 I'd say. 
 I will, and welcome again. 
 Thank you all the same! 
 Bye.

 What a terrible, and terrible! What! What's the point of dancing? 
 I thought it was very boring. 
 You said it! It is a very normal kind of modern dance. 
 Don't move my arms with my fingers. You dance like madmen. 
 I don't know what to think.Do you think we have the same in America? Do you think they have the same in France? 
 I am not sure. 
 Ah, no! 
 There are some dance music at the moment, as you say. I don't like it.It's too hard to find some kind of music that you like.You'Ve been dancing like mopados for months. 
 And I dance the liest, you know, the one with blue eyes. 
 Oh!
