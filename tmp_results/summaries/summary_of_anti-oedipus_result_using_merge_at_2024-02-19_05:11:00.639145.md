Michel Foucault and Mark Seem's work titled "Desiring-MACHINES" comprises a collection of short literary pieces with three main themes or syntheses. Firstly, Desired-Production I covers topics such as connective synthesis (production of production), body without organs concept, anti-production, and paranoiac machines. Secondly, disjunctive synthesis or recording production emphasizes the traits of schizophrenic individuals and celibates. Lastly, Desiring-Production II's conjunctive synthesis delves into consumption-consummation involving production of consumption as well as consumption itself. Furthermore, "A Materialist Psychiatry" provides a materialistic viewpoint on the world focusing on differences in regimes.

This text covers various topics within psychoanalysis. Desiring-machines refer to three types of break involving flows, chains or codes, and attachments from them. The Imperialism of Oedipus 51 analyzes a shift in psychoanalysis concerning Oedipus complex. Three Texts of Freud 56 discusses flattening Judge Schreber's "delirium" while emphasizing that psychoanalysis remains pious. Lastly, The Whole and Its Parts 42 focuses on multiplicities' status, partial objects, and critiquing Oedipal mystification. Connective Synthesis of Production 68 delves into family structures in psychoanalysis considering global and specific aspects along with partial and non-specific attachments.

The given text discusses Freud's psychoanalytic theory focusing on the concept called the Oedipal double-bind, which highlights Oedipus' dominance in every situation. Two applications of this idea are explored in 'Conjunctive Synthesis of Consumption-Consummation 84,' namely segregative and biunivocal, nomadic and polyvocal. Desiring-production and social production are significant themes related to psychoanalysis concerning this topic. Finally, a summary named "A Recapitulation of the Three Syntheses 106" delves into the meaning of belief and meaning in terms of desiring as a transformative force affecting psychic repression but not explicitly defining psychoanalytic principles involving Oedipus.

In essence, this text talks about Freud's psychological theory centered around an important concept called the Oedipal double-bind. This idea emphasizes Oedipus' control in every situation. Two main applications of this notion are explored in a separate study titled 'Conjunctive Synthesis of Consumption-Consummation 84,' which deals with segregative vs biunivocal, nomadic vs polyvocal aspects. Additionally, themes like desiring-production and social production play significant roles in psychoanalysis related to this topic. Lastly, a summary named "A Recapitulation of the Three Syntheses 106" delves into the meaning behind belief and meaning as they relate to desiring as a

The article focuses on analyzing different abstract concepts through character representations. These characters stand for artistic creativity (Turner), a social entity coding human flows and memories (Inscribing Socius), processes involving deterritorialization and territories (Primitive Territorial Machine), and incestuous relationships (Problem of Oedipus). The characters are referred to as 'savages,' 'barbarians,' or 'citizens.' Additionally, investments and disinvestments in organs impact the functioning of Inscribing Socius.

El estudio se centra en analizar diferentes conceptos abstractos a través de representaciones de personajes. Estas características simbolizan la creatividad artística (Turner), una entidad social que codifica las corrientes y memorias para los seres humanos (Inscribing Socius), procesos de deterritorialización y territorios (Primitive Territorial Machine), y relaciones incestuosas (Problem of Oedipus). Los personajes se etiquetan como 'savages,' 'barbarians,' o 'citizens.' Además, las inversiones y desinversiones en órganos modifican la funcionalidad de Inscribing Socius.

Two groups named culturalists and universalists hold common beliefs called postulates in this text. One example given is Oedipus. Other ideas mentioned include descriptions of a despot's embodiment in 'The Barbarian Despotic Machine 192,' territorial representation in 'Territorial Representation 184,' Nietzsche discussing the end of territorial systems, and finally Barbarian or Imperial Representation 200 focusing on elements such as incest with voice-graphism relationship and deterritorialized sign concepts.These terms represent different themes explored by these groups in their shared beliefs.

The author delves into various topics linked to surplus value, money forms, capitalist systems, Urstaat (a specific type of state), class dynamics, Capitalist Representation 240 representation, deterritorialization, re-territorializations, and social machines. Surplus value is transformed into a code form, distinguishing different monetary forms with their falling tendencies. Capitalist states relate to Urstaat and classes while Capitalist Representation s visual elements such as figures or schematic flows are discussed. Code versus axiomatic distinction is explored along with deterritorialization processes connecting to re-territorializations. Three significant social machines - territorial, despotic, undefined - play crucial roles in these processes.[VOLUME 2][SPEED 1.X] Der Autor betrachtet verschiedene Themen rund um Überschusswertigkeit, Geldformen, kapitalistische Staaten, Urstaat (ein spezifischer Typus von Staat), Klassenverhältnisse, Kapitalistische Darstellung 240 und ihre Darstellung sowie Deterritorialisierung, Re-territorialisations und sozialmaschinen. Der Überschusswert wird in eine Codeform umgewandelt, unterscheidend verschiedene Geldbildungen mit ihren tendenzielle Fallenden. Kapitalistische Staaten sind mit Urstaat und Klassen verbunden



The given text consists of three different summaries discussing various topics within each title mentioned. Firstly, "The Social Field 273" delves into concepts like social reproduction alongside human reproduction. Next, Oedipus at Last examines three distinct states: despotic symbolism, capitalist imagery, and a fusion of despotic and capitalist representations. Finally, The Molecular Unconscious focuses on the link between desire and machine while exploring two different machine states as well as molecular functionalism, syntheses, large aggregates versus micro-multiplicities, gigantism versus micro-multiplicities of desire, and nonhuman sexuality involving multiple sexes rather than one or two. Lastly, Psychoanalysis and Capitalism ties back to representation and production while exploring its connection with myth, tragedy, and capitalism.

The given text condenses the main ideas in Schizoanalysis 322 into four major points. Firstly, "Desiring-production and its machines" represents an initial positive task focusing on desire generation. Secondly, a theory called 'twopoles' serves as the second positive task, discussing dualistic concepts. Thirdly, the concept of "The mechanic's task of schizoanalysis" deals with recognizing affinities between molar and molecular entities. Finally, in the third positive task, discussions revolve around death within psychoanalytical context related to body without organs and death desires. Additionally, there is a theory about social investment with two thesis statements: investments are primarily molar, social, andgregarious; investments can be categorized into class and interest types.

This discusses how writing and speaking as truth-telling encompasses concepts such as Marxism, Freudian theory, and sign systems. In the early '70s, Vietnam acted as a major challenge to authorities. Following this period (five years) saw joyful rebellion and mystery. One viewpoint interprets these five years as revolutionary politics battling exploitation and psychic repression while sparking libido-driven class struggle. This perspective considers events during those years as a dualistic dream impacting society.

Anti-Oedipus is considered an "art" work rather than philosophy, focusing on concepts such as multiplicities, flows, arrangements, and connections relating to desire's link with reality and capitalism. It deals with integrating desire into thought, conversation, and action while exploring practical queries. The text features three antagonists differing in potency and presenting varying degrees of threat - political ascetics, sad militants, and theory terrorists upholding pure politics order.

The given passage talks about a revolutionary ethical text named "Anti-Oedipus," originating from France. It represents a notable shift from previous works and targets fascism as its primary antagonist. Historically significant figures like Hitler and Mussolini exemplify fascistic ideologies that exploit crowds' desires. Anti-oedipalism serves as an ideological framework against fascism in everyday life for many individuals. Notably, philosophers Deleuze and Guattari are recognized as Christian moralists who analyze any traces of fascism within humanity. This text also pays a small tribute to Saint Francis de Sales, highlighting broader themes explored throughout Anti-Oedipus.



Original Text: Deleuze and Guattari's work draws upon a text by a seventeenth-century priest and Bishop of Geneva renowned for his Introduction to the Devout Life. This text discards traditional negative categories such as law, limit, castration, lack, and lacuna in favor of fostering action, thought, and desires through proliferation, juxtaposition, and disjunction. The authors reject conventional notions of power as a static construct and instead propose an alternative worldview emphasizing plurality, difference, and dynamic arrangements over fixed systems.



El Anti-Oedipus es un libro que explora estrategias manipulativas dirigidas a los lectores sin su conocimiento. Sus trucos incluyen invitarles a desconectarse del texto o cerrar la puerta con brutalza. En este trabajo, Henry Miller, Gilles Deleuze y Felix Guattari analizan la idea de la "santa familia" en el Psychoanalysis a través de una agresión sobre su complejo de Edipo. Además, Henry Miller habla de conceptos egoísticos individualistas en Sexus, destacando su importancia en la identidad personal. [/ESPECIFIC]



[SUMMARY /******/User/_ಠ\_zeichnelschemaresantheologieinstitutionalizedchurchbeliefsneuroticstranquilityestablishedmethodsanalysis]

Das Text verkündet zwei unterschiedliche kritische Werke und ihre Beziehung. Anti-Oedipus wird als Angriff auf Ego, psychoanalytische Interpretationen und Lebensweisen abgelekt von Oedipalanalyse beschrieben. Dieses Werk kann als Nachfolger eines ähnlichen Versuchs von Nietzsche gesehen werden - dieser kritisierte im Werk "The Antichrist" Christus, Christentum und Herdenmentality. Nietzsche meint, dass Psychoanalyse eine institutionalisierte Kirche geworden ist mit ihren eigenen Glaubensvorstellungen nur von Anhängern als Therapie akzeptiert werden kann. Neurotiker streben nach einer ruhigen Existenz über diese etablierten Methoden der Analyse.

Fazley Hatırlama: Nietzsche'İn Anti-Oedipus öğretmenlikten başlayıp fascizm üveyrinin artışına ömeroğrenirken batıldığı tamamen boşlagılarının gösterilmesini aniden yeni bir konuşma açırlar. Bu ülkelerinde batıldığı ümsüzlerde fascizmi soğumak kolayılmamıştır ve geriletiyorlar uzun uzun boyırtılmamış bir yönetimden uzaklaştıklarımışın gibi. Önlük olmasına dağru ödeğilikleri de bu durumda gerçekleşiyor; insanlar fazleşen gruplara nefret ederek 'superego' grubu adını verebilirler ve kendilerini öyle gösterirler ki onlar netık ve diğerleri kötü ve aklağız (örnek olarak Fascist, Kapitalist ve Komünist olabilir). Bu nitelikte Nicholas'in içerişlerini etkinleştirmektedir. [ÜSTNU]Resuming: Nietzsche's Anti-Oedipus starts by addressing a major concern about fascism's rise. Western cultures tend to dismiss fascism as an external issue, avoiding direct confrontation with it. Even revolutionary groups cautiously address fasc

The duo Deleuze and Guattari introduced an unconventional psychoanalytical view called 'Anti-Oedipus.' Their main focus is diagnosing and treating individuals suffering from schizophrenia rather than addressing societal issues through psychoanalysis. They challenge the conventional belief that psychoanalysis should primarily address societal problems instead of individual therapy for patients. Deleuze and Guattari emphasize the importance of unique personal experiences in their approach, contrasting neurotic patients with schizophrenics who can better engage in psychoanalysis due to their ability to question established norms and structures within society. Alongside Laing, Deleuze promotes a materialistic and experiential analysis of schizophrenic cases instead of traditional psychoanalytical methods.



In this text, Deleuze and Guattari explore intense realms of desire and desiring-production through their examination. Their work delves into oscillations such as paranoia vs schizophrenia, fascism vs revolution, breakdowns vs breakthroughs with a focus on the schizophrenic process of desire. Anti-Oedipus is an experiment incorporating various authors and thinkers like Deleuze who references Marx, Freud, and Reich. Although influenced by both Marx and Freud, Anti-OEDipus avoids merging Freudianism with Marxism but rather emphasizes the economy of desire's flows and productions as a core concept.

The text revolves around a theoretical clash involving Freud (psychoanalysis), Marx, and Nietzche. Their confrontation makes psychoanalysis seemingly impossible. Instead, the authors propose an alternative scenario where Marx collaborating with Nietzche enhances Marx's analysis of money circulation in society. Nietzsche's Anti-Oedipus theory emphasizes affects, intensity, desires, and will related to conscious and unconscious forces. This theory connects desire directly to social fields and monetary systems based on profit, complementing Marx's theories of alienation.

Deleoften focuses on challenging dominant culture through thought-provoking ideas that offer an alternative path for humanity. Notable figures like Nietzsche and Marx are integral to this cultural sphere, while thinkers such as Miller, Lawrence, Kafka, Beckett, Proust, and Foucault explore themes such as insanity, disagreement, politics, and desire. Their book 'Anti-Oedipus' delves into the clash between Nietzsche's philosophical ideologies and Marx's political ones; thought versus revolution; Deleuze as philosopher versus militant activism. Essentially,'Anti-OEDipus' combines three modes of knowledge in its examination.

Deleoz and Guattari use an unorthodox method in discussing politics by integrating various authors and concepts as effects within their analyses, creating new impacts and references. Their approach draws inspiration from Marx and Freud's analysis of desires but leaves some areas unexplored comprehensively.



This summary talks about two individuals named Delezo and Guattere who claim that Oedipus goes beyond being just a psychoanalytic concept. They argue it represents imperialism in some way. Critics point out that using symbols can distort reality, leading to submissive subjects due to imposed power. Deleuze and Guattari further suggest anti-Oedipalists oppose egoistic ideas and 'homo' concepts while attacking simplified psychoanalytic and political analyses.

Deleozi and Guattari analyze how beliefs affect a person's bodily experiences while restraining their instinctual urges. They also study instances where individuals overcome power's influence. Their book "Anti-Oedipus" proposes that everyone encounters Oedipalization and neurotic impact in diverse settings like home, school, work, and personal life. Neurotics are susceptible to Oedipal imprints' effects, whereas psychotics remain unaffected by them even through psychoanalysis sessions.

Deleoze and Guattari introduced the schizoanalytic method alongside similar ideas from authors like Miller, Nietzsche, and Artaud. Miller proposes that genuine healing happens when individuals forget their identities. He argues reality is all-encompassing, everyone is neurotic, and recovery requires rising from the grave while discarding unnecessary baggage. Miller maintains healing should be approached collectively despite being personal, enabling balanced singularity and collective aspects once egos are dismissed for non-neurotic politics to become feasible.

The given text focuses on a group called the subject-group, which aims to initiate significant changes in society by investing in libidinal energy. Their objective is to disrupt traditional power structures through unconventional actions driven by desires. "Anti-Oedipus" analyzes how these groups create entities that defy death instincts and resist normative social rules often characterized by exclusionary practices. To bring about this transformation, the groups must adapt their connections constantly and devise innovative ways of organizing socially. Illich's concept of a "toolbox" suggests treating theory as a collection of practical instruments to facilitate efficient transformation processes effectively.

Deleleuzo and Guattari use a schizoanalytic approach to examine desire's impact on individuals and groups in their book "Anti-Oedipus." They argue political collectives must address the role of desire critically. Desire, per their theory, involves forming connections; rigid structures impede escape possibilities resulting in neurosis. Deleuze, Guattari, and Laing assert neurosis is irreversible emotion remedy for which lies in drugs or collective experiences.

The given text talks about Deleuze and Guattari's "Anti-Oedipus," which embodies individuals or groups free from traditional norms, working towards liberating humanity from oppressive ideas. It also refers to Nietzsche's "Antichrist" as another example of such entities. Deleuze's anti-militant stance represents madness aiming for detachment from power structures and connecting with a collective essence. Militant action contrasts individualistic passion by fostering connections beyond madness to generate new possibilities in politics of desire while combating loneliness and depression.

Deleleuze and Guattari examine the concept of "desiring-production" in their book Anti-Oedipus. They assert that suppression of desire within society isn't caused by a longing for the mother against the father but rather stems from assuming an altered identity under repression's influence. Desire inherently disrupts societal norms due to its nature, and Deleuze believes no machine can maintain order without destroying social structures entirely. Their analysis includes various desire types and forces, suggesting that understanding revolutionaries and artists provides insights into this complex phenomenon.

In this text, the focus lies on Buchner bringing back Lenz's walk amidst challenges related to societal norms concerning religion, family dynamics, and nature. Simultaneously, diverse machines appear throughout the narrative, including self-driving devices and those powered by others. An organ-machine connects to an energy source via a machine interface. Furthermore, breastfeeding is analogous to a milk production machine, while mouths serve multiple purposes such as eating, talking, or breathing. Notably, mouth functions adapt in cases of anorexia where these roles become uncertain.

Daniel Paul Schreber was a German judge experiencing mental issues that led him into psychiatric treatment from 1884 when he was forty-two years old. He spent most of his life in and out of mental institutions. Lenz's viewpoint considers everything as machines - celestial objects, rainbows, natural processes such as alpine ones, photosynthesis mechanisms included. According to Lenz, nature is a production process where one thing leads to another, connecting the machines altogether. In his perspective, concepts like self and non-self, inside versus outside lose significance.

In 1903, at the age of sixty-one, Freud published memoirs about a nervous illness called "Memoirs of a Nervous Illness" which laid the groundwork for his significant 1911 study on paranoia named "Psycho-Analytic Notes." His essay "Anti-Oedipus" touches upon bicycles, horns, and Freud's mother delivering him into the world. Freud proposes that in "Oedipus," a repression of desire-driven mechanisms takes place.

In the essay "Malone Dies," Lady Pedal combines activities with schizophrenics featuring a van, rowboat, and picnic in a natural setting. She frames their experience as a production process. In this story, nature contrasts with industrialization as it represents the opposite of industrialized environments. Industries extract raw materials from nature while eventually returning them to be processed again. Within society, complex relationships exist among nature-industry connections, nature-society interactions, and societal engagements with nature itself, creating a dynamic that can seem disjointed at times.

This article discusses "The Desire-Machines 3," a concept connecting it to various Oedipal mechanisms, processes, and structures. The authors substitute "OEDipus" for the traditional "The Oedips Complex." This concept consists of four relatively independent spheres: production, distribution, consumption, and consumption viewed from Marx's perspective on developed formal structures assuming capital existence, labor division, and false consciousness.

The text explores two interpretations of the French word "process," referring to both production and nature. One meaning involves recording and consumption within a production process. Additionally, this term eliminates divisions between humans and nature regarding roles in industry or production. This fusion results in viewing industry as integral to human existence and connecting humans with all living beings and cosmic elements. Humans are depicted beyond dominion over creation; instead, they are portrayed as deeply connected individuals interacting with various life forms such as stars and animals.

George Bataille delves into the notion of "sumptuary," referring to extravagant spending unrelated to productivity concerning nature's energy. Such opulent expenses are seen not separate from human production but rather connected to consumption itself. In essence, consumption and production share a common reality where they cannot be viewed independently. Bataille elaborates further by stating that production goes beyond idealistic categories and forms a loop with desire as an intrinsic principle. Desiring-production is the primary focus of materialist psychiatry which considers individuals as "Homo natur," representing their natural human state.

The given text discusses an intricate analogy involving multiple concepts. It compares a challenging process to preventing a dire consequence but focuses on themes such as love and a vast cosmic setting with efficient devices representing schizophrenia. These machines follow specific rules in their associations, linking productivity to nature. The narrative touches upon binary machines adhering to patterns of cooperation, interruption by other elements drawing off part of the flow - examples include breastfeeding or speaking - which disrupt the smooth flow of productivity.

The given text explores various themes concerning objects, machines, and their interactions. Objects undergo constant transformation while also fragmenting themselves. An organ-machine perceives its surroundings through energy flow or "flux." The eye interprets everything based on the incoming energy stream. Machines interact laterally, disrupting each other's energy flow. This interaction generates a synthesis called "connective synthesis," which can also be manifested as product/production relationships. Product/production refers to something additional added onto the original product. Desiring-production is producing production itself.

A person with schizophrenia views the table as unusually big yet shrinking its identity as a table. They see it filled with random items without purpose. Heavy and immovable, this table has no practical use nor an even surface for activities. It's designed to be self-reliant and resistant against any purpose or interaction, possibly representing a frozen engine metaphorically. Occasionally, artworks made by European mental institution inmates are edited by someone.

Claude Levi-Strauss introduces the concept of bricolage as an assemblage of varied traits with limited resources and rules for constant rearrangement of fragments into new patterns or configurations. Creators engage in this process without caring about specific outcomes but rather focus on available tools and overall results. Bricolage can be likened to a "handyman" activity providing distinct satisfaction beyond traditional roles such as 'mother' or 'father.' This creativity type is known as desiring-machines or primary production.

The 'bricoleur,' mentioned in Claude Levi-Strauss's "The Savage Mind," is someone proficient in multiple tasks but with no structured approach concerning materials and tools for particular projects. This individual works within a limited set of resources stemming from previous constructions or demolitions, not following any predetermined blueprint or organized scheme.]

English auktorithiílli: Claude Levi-Strauss introduced the term 'bricoleur' in his work "The Savage Mind." This refers to an individual who possesses diverse skills but lacks organization when it comes to materials and tools for specific tasks. The bricoleur operates within a restricted toolset derived from past experiences with construction or demolition projects, unrelated to any planned methodology or systematic arrangement.

The given text talks about an imaginary concept of an inert body form without organs attributed to Artaud. This individual experienced no shape or form after discovering such idea. Desire-driven machines are efficient when they deteriorate over time and break down consistently. Judge Schrebler faced various health problems including lack of a stomach, damaged lungs, torn esophagus, broken bladder, and impaired lung function throughout his life.

A constant body plays an important part in manufacturing processes within this text. It specifically refers to a bodiless entity engaging in both production and antiproduction activities, which are seen as synthesis. This synthesis combines production with its opposite element called antiproduct. Conflict arises between desiring-machires (desire-driven machines) and the body due to discomfort experienced by it when sensing machine operations like couplings and sounds. On a deeper level, beneath organ functioning, the body detects signs of larvae or worms and suspects divine intervention in an unfair manner.

A summary of this passage discusses a paranoiac machine as an attempt by desire-driven entities to enter humans through non-organic means, which is rejected due to perceived threats. This machine's roots lie in the clash between production processes and lifeless bodies. In Antonin Artaud's translation of French text, it is conveyed that a body is solely itself without needing an organ; bodies are not considered organisms but enemies to true bodily existence.

The given text explores 'desiring-production' in a particular context aside from direct psychoanalytic references. Translating "Jnvestissement" to French as 'to invest,' it aligns better with its meaning in libidinal and political economy within the text. The discussed Desiring-MACHINES connects desiring-production to social production but doesn't conclude on their nature or relationship nor determines if they are distinct entities. Instead, this comparison underscores similarities between forms of social production.

In essence, the text analyzes a concept called 'desiring-production,' highlighting its connection to social production while acknowledging that it diverges from psychoanalytic literature references. It also suggests translating "Jnvestissement" as 'to invest' for better understanding in French related to libidinal and political economy contexts. Despite not establishing conclusions about the nature or relationship between desiring-production and social production nor determining if they are separate entities, the comparison emphasizes their similarities in forms of social production.

The text explores how societies construct a recording medium for manufacturing processes. This medium records every step of production, giving an impression that the entire process originates from it. Societies' unconscious actions lead to this 'delirium,' where the surface appears as the source of the journey itself. Capital can be seen as a power representation without a body; money serves as both fluid and solid forms representing its self-generating nature through production processes.

Marx believed humans closely relate to capital, making their actions appear controlled by it. Capitalists see a distinction between capital and labor but view capital as an instrument extracting value from workers. In this system, capital acts like a recording medium affecting production processes, distorting reality and creating a spellbound atmosphere. Capitalist growth influences labor's productivity beyond direct work into the self-generating capital itself. Capital seems magical because its productive force appears internal rather than stemming from labor efforts.

The given text talks about an abstract idea involving a framework without physical form that acts as a platform to record desires and production processes. It introduces the notion of replacing machines: attraction-machine substituting repulsion-machine, followed by miraculating-machine succeeding paranoiac machine. These machines are related to organ-machines which can connect with bodies like padding in fencing jackets or medals on wrestlers' jerseys. In this context, a bodiless entity serves as a base for generating desiring machines upon Judge Schreber who attracts God's rays onto himself.

A schizophrenic person has limited money but creates a fragmented world where each segment represents a response to a new situation or answer to an intrusive questioner. This intertwined method of recording and writing suggests the creation process extends into documenting itself. According to Schrebler's view, the 'body without organs,' considered spiritually as 'not God,' is actually divine energy flowing through it, attracting everything involved in the process while functioning as an enchantment surface. Schreber has an unusual bond with God.

The article discusses Schreber, who focuses on disjunctive syllogism as a belief. His divine nature is established through divisions and fragmented connections. These divisions consist of distinct empires split by time - earlier ones, later ones, and even those involving superior and inferior Gods. Freud highlights the importance of these disjointed associations in Schreber's delirious state. As per Freud, paranoia's decomposition is analogous to its nature, mirroring how hysteria compresses. These decompositions are consequences of compressions.

Original: The given paragraph talks about Schreber, who believes in mastering disjunctive syllogism. His divine nature is determined through division and disjointed connections. These divisions involve different empires separated by time - earlier ones, later ones, and even those of a superior and inferior God. Freud emphasizes the significance of these disjointed syntheses in Schreber's delirious state. According to Freud, paranoia's decomposition is characteristic of it, similar to how hysteria condenses. These decompositions are results of condensations.

In this text, Oedipus stands for an important role in societal reproduction involving desire formation. The character Molloy is consistently under observation and scrutiny. Beckett's Molloy participates in a process called desiring-production, connecting him with nature while questioning societal norms such as names (his own name, father's name, mother's name). Throughout the narrative of desire generation, Beckett comes up during a policeman's mention but Molloy fails to remember his mother's name. After police interrogation, Molloy experiences confusion or memory loss regarding his mom.

This text revolves around a schizophrenic named Schrebler, who can create his own reference points and challenge established norms. Freud connects Schrebler's mother to the Virgin Mary. In gaming terms, Schrebler has a character called Artaud who believes in complex concepts such as young girls representing divine entities, talking birds, his father as a superior God, and his brother as an inferior God. Artaud's character generates transcendent divine forms beyond simplistic Oedipal triangle connections. Desire-production sets up a binary-linear system considering Schrebler's entire body as the third element in a series: 2, 1, 2.
This is an approximation of the original text.

Adolf Wolfli produces complex artwork featuring interconnected mechanisms like clocks, turbines, dynamos, celestial devices, household appliances, etc. Antonin Artaut assumes various roles - father, son, father again, mother - while preserving his individual identity. A schizophrenic person has a unique way of identifying self within their own framework distinct from societal norms. This personal system exhibits extreme flexibility and doesn't align with conventional standards; it blends delirious thoughts and desires seamlessly.

## Common Core Reviewable Optimal Answer Latitude
The given text talks about two different individuals and their distinctive approaches. Adolf Wolfli creates intricate artwork depicting interconnected mechanisms such as clocks, turbines, dynamos, celestial devices, appliances, etc. Antonin Artaut takes on multiple roles - father, son, father again, mother - while maintaining his individual identity. A schizophrenic person has a unique method of identifying self within their own framework apart from societal norms. This personal system displays extreme flexibility and doesn't adhere to conventional standards; it seamlessly combines delirious thoughts and desires.

The text discusses Schreber's genealogical drawing series with an inconsistent recording process resulting in disjointed outcomes. However, a consistent pattern emerges at the end. This drawing method introduces irregularities but Schreber continues due to uniformity in final results. Furthermore, body modifications involve organ-machines attached without becoming true organs themselves, preserving the fluidity and slipperiness of bodily formations.

The unknown entity exhibits no fixed shape and has no organs; it feeds on outputs from desiring machines. Its identity is defined by its creations, which depend on consumption patterns and states. Rewards appear as assuming different forms ('becoming') or avatars. A judge named Schreber believes God maintains consistent cosmic sexual pleasure by transforming Schreversely related to 'Schreber sees God', which implies a spiritual connection where Schreber is observing divine entities and interpreting their actions.

In Freud's perspective, part of the libido transforms into recording energy (Numen) and satisfaction energy (Voluptas). This altered energy fuels the third unconscious synthesis called conjunctive synthesis—"it is what it is..." or consumption production. In this synthesis, the tension between desire-machines and bodiless organs finds resolution. The repulsion experienced in primary repression's paranoiac machines evolves into attraction within Robert Gie's "miraculating" devices for electrical paranoia control.

Micembre Deutscher schriftsteller Schreber nalehnt eine weibliche Erscheinung während seiner Genesung und umgeben von Paraphernalien. Seine Oberkörper ist teilweise entblößt mit Ziährlichkeiten wie Rösslern und Halskrönten. Dieser Zustand stellt einen "celibaten Machine" dar, der nach früheren Maschinen namens paranoiac und miraculating folgend auftritt und eine Allianz zwischen den begehrenden Maschinen und der bodilosen Form bildet. Michel Carrouges tritt nicht direkt auf als zentraler Akteur, aber er ist verbunden mit dem Einführungssegel von Konzepten wie celibaten Machine und deren Bezug zu Schrebers Charakterwandel.``

Marcel Duchamp's artwork "La mariee mise a nu par ses celibataires, meme" represents celibate machines in essence. Similar instances of these machines appear in Kafka's "In the Penal Colony," Roussel's creations, Jarry's Surmale (Supermale), Edgar Allan Poe's machines, and Villiers's Eve futur e. Common features of celibate machines involve revealing an older paranoiac machine featuring its inherent tortures.

[ANS]The given text talks about how Marcel Duchamp's artwork "La mariee mise a nu par ses celibataires, meme" represents celibate machines as one of its main themes. Other examples of these machines can be found in works like Kafka's "In the Penal Colony," Raymond Roussel's creations, Jarry's Surmale (Supermale), Edgar Allan Poe's machines, and Villiers's Eve futur e. These celibate machines share certain traits such as unveiling an older paranoiac machine with its built-in tortures. [/)

The text focuses on extreme emotional episodes called hallucinations and delirium. These intense experiences lack clear definition and structure. Hallucinations and thought deliriation represent strong feelings that determine their content and object. Although commonly linked to deliriousness and hallucinatory situations, these emotions can be seen as deeply ingrained feelings manifesting as hallucinations or internalizing the delirial state. Primarily, intense emotions form the basis for these phenomena.

The Kantian theory portrays Judge Schreber as displaying schizoid tendencies. This theory revolves around intensive quantities filling empty spaces in matter unevenly. Intense emotions of attraction and repulsion trigger nervous states affecting the body beyond organ limits, causing transformations such as gender changes or multiple identities in an endless loop. The judge's exposed chest with breasts is not delusional nor imaginary but signifies a zone of intensity on his body, analogous to a predetermined area within an egg-like structure marked by axes and thresholds.]

Bion emphasizes a notable "fee" concept in a fictional context given by his portrayal of its relation to an imaginary character called Rag. W.R., author of the analytical book "Elements of Psycho-analysis" published in London around 1963 (pages 94 onward), creates this character who exists in a fantasy realm due to psychiatric practices. Rag is depicted as a schizo attempting to maintain an unbearable state where mind meets matter while experiencing intense emotions. From Bion's perspective, psychoanalysis reduces individuals into pitiful beings focused solely on parental relationships (daddy-and-mommy), disregarding other aspects of life.

In 'Beckett's Unnamable,' a central focus lies in an entity without a physical body creating circular patterns around machines. These circles represent various stages or states throughout the text. Simultaneously produced with these machines, an amorphous subject moves through all degrees of the circle without a fixed identity. It transitions from one state to another but does not have its center within the machine; instead, it remains on the periphery, constantly changing its definition due to passing through different states. In a celibate machine context, this subject is born from each state and keeps getting reborn into the next state while engaging with all previous states that cause its births and rebirths. Stimmung, introduced by Klossowski as tangible emotion representing materiality in this scenario, becomes significant."

It moves from one state to another but doesn't have its center within the machine; instead, it remains on the periphery, constantly changing its definition due to passing through different states.

Friedreich Nietzsche discusses individuals trying to find their place within a broader context while dealing with uncontrollable shifts. These fluctuations represent different identities from the person's self-perception. One's identity consists of multiple experiences throughout these stages. Unlike a philologist losing grip and identifying with various people, there is an entity transitioning through states and connecting them to historical figures: every name in history stands for something significant.

Philosopher Nietzsche takes a novel approach to history by integrating past discussions into his current work. He views historical events as intense zones on an abstract framework, positioning himself as the main character of this narrative. Contrary to conventional methods, Nietzsche actively shapes and develops history's course. His perspective on remembering history resembles a one-person show where a solo performer represents all aspects of an event during a single performance within a day, as explained in 'The Desiring-MACHINES'.

Psychiatrist G. de Clerambault proposes a view wherein delirium is seen as a secondary outcome from partial and localized automatistic events. He uses "mental automatism" for athematic phenomena like odd sounds or sudden irrational outbursts caused by infection effects or intoxicating substances. De Clerium believes delirium represents a characteristic feature of recording processes creating desiring-machines. While syntheses and process-specific disorders exist, paranoia isn't considered an independent sphere in this context.

The given text focuses on outlining the core ideas behind schizophrenia theory. It encompasses three major notions: dissociation, autism, and space-time/being-in-the-world. One key concept is Z2 ANTI-OEDIPUS, signifying an inherent aspect of schizophrenia - a complete detachment from external reality coupled with an intense internal life experienced by individuals suffering from schizophrenia. These ideas connect schizophrenia to the ego perspective.

A group of people thinks individuals diagnosed as 'schizo' can't say the word 'J.' One person expresses annoyance about this supposed limitation and vows not to utter it themselves. Instead, they will use third person pronouns if convenient. This person also notes that saying 'I' doesn't matter since they are detached from such issues. Concerning Freud's theory of ego, they believe it is simplified into a tripartite model consisting of father, mother, and self. Additionally, the individual claims Freud's Oedipus complex led to misinterpreting autism concepts with schizophrenia.

The given text discusses a theoretical idea named Oedipus, which functions as a psychoanalytic framework linking individuals to production processes. In this framework, only one relationship is acknowledged - production. Psychoanalysis initially identified desire production within the unconscious realm. However, an idealistic approach replaced this unconscious recognition with classical theater representations and related units of production. This transition altered our understanding of schizophrenia by viewing it through an ego perspective rather than original unconscious processes.

The article zeroes in on Karl Jaspers' work '24 ANTI-OEDIPUS,' exploring his concept of 'idealism.' Jaspers views the process he refers to as ideal forms of causation, comprehension, or manifestation -- distinct from actual manufacturing processes it relies upon. The text introduces a term called schizophrenic -- easily identifiable individuals who can distinguish themselves as separate personalities when the process is paused or continues indefinitely within a void. Additionally, Kraepelin describes schizophrenics as personifications of 'horror of extremity,' leading to souls and bodies perishing, resulting in individuals becoming artificial persons.

The text focuses on a change in interpreting desire's nature from Kant's critical standpoint. Traditionally, desire is viewed as aiming for acquiring objects. However, Kant disputes this by connecting the existence faculty to desires through their representations. This implies desires generate reality for their objects instead of just seeking them externally. Kant sees desire as an idealistic concept where lack or absence of an object can be considered alongside the actual object itself. Additionally, he acknowledges desire's production aspect and links it to superstitious beliefs and hallucinations in his critical revolution.

In psychological terms, desire is considered an authentic factor creating imaginary objects. Psychoanalysis views desires as generating fantasies connected to real objects rather than natural or societal creations externally. These fantasies serve as alternative representations of reality; they act as dreamed-object counterparts to real objects and mental productions behind tangible items. Even when deeply analyzed, such as portraying desire as a specific machine emphasizing it, the core concept remains unchanged. This notion of desire as a "desirable machine" may seem theatrical but stems from needs and demands.

In simplified terms, philosopher Clement Rosset believes desires are seen as a lack or shortcoming instead of an action involved in creating something. He suggests when emphasizing desire, it creates an additional world next to the original one. Desires and their targets are essentially equal, considering the object desired as another connected device. If desire generates something concrete, its result is real and productive; this creation can only happen in the real world and forms reality itself. The tangible outcome comes from passive syntheses of desire that construct fragmented objects, energy streams, and bodily functions as production units.

The text discusses the relationship between desires and needs. While connected, desires stem from needs but exceed them. Desires have a link with objective reality while lack is their opposite effect. Needs can be seen as outcomes of desires in Marx's viewpoint, where fulfilling emptiness represents searching for satisfaction within undefined conditions. Satisfying basic necessities like eating arise due to the limitations in meeting desires through alternative means.

The given text highlights how desire has parallels with grass in terms of being closely interconnected and needing minimal requirements. It underscores that desire lacks clarity when compared to human intentions, primarily focusing on manifestation within reality. The author offers an alternative viewpoint wherein desire isn't seen as a deficiency but rather emphasizes the absence of organized structure impeding its objective existence. Revolutionaries, artists, and visionary individuals are content with being objective since they comprehend desire's influence on life through its intense productivity while having few demands.

The given text discusses Lacansk's desire theory with two contrasting aspects. One aspect focuses on an object called "small a" acting as a "desiring-machine," while the other revolves around a significant entity termed the "great Other." This introduces an idea of insufficiency. In Serge Leclaire's article "La réalité du désir" (Chapter 4, reference note 26), this oscillation is evident. Lacan imagines a phantasmal world that remains unconquered and belongs to the past instead of future. He views the true visionary as a Neapolitan revolutionary named Spinoza from his perspective.

The given text explores the notion of Manque in French thought, focusing on managing desires amidst abundant production. It underscores that desires rely upon actual production seen as separate from one's desire itself. Manque disputes societal production creating reality as fantasy instead of factuality and highlights only secondary connections through mental processes like introjection and projection. These connections imply societal practices have internal correlations in our minds. Additionally, the text draws parallels between money, gold, capital, the capitalist triangle, and libido-related terms with family triangle concepts during analysis for enjoyment purposes.

This article discusses a book titled "Qui est aliene?" authored by Marx in Paris during 1970. In this work, Marxist philosophy rejects scarcity as an initial premise. Scarcity implies an inherent connection between supply and demand laws, making them resistant to destruction fundamentally. These economic principles precede Marxism itself. Despite Marx's comprehensive analysis, he abstains from invoking scarcity concepts. Instead, Marx maintains that social production solely depends on desires, which significantly impact the social realm.

Reich delves into the notion of people enduring difficult circumstances while requesting fewer food provisions but demanding higher taxes. His focus lies in challenging exploitation concepts within society, aimingly understanding how widespread desires contribute to fascism acceptance despite lacking a concrete answer. Furthermore, Reich introduces a distinction between rationality and irrationality in desire formation processes.

In simpler terms, Reich examines why people accept tough situations but want less food yet more taxes. He questions unfair practices in society that lead to accepting fascist ideas even though no clear explanation is given. Additionally, he highlights differences between logical and illogical ways desires are formed.

The article focuses on Psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich's view in psychoanalysis. His primary goal is to examine negative, subjective aspects and inhibited elements within society. Reich intends to revive a dualistic approach between rational and irrational entities in psychiatry. To establish the foundation for materialistic psychiatry, he introduces a concept called "desiring-production," applicable to both irrational and rational realities. Despite societal repression affecting desiring production, its fundamental principle of desire generating reality remains unaffected. Desire-producing machines are not separate from societal production nor fantasy constructs but rather manifestations of this underlying process secondary to it.

In group fantasy situations, an individual's sexual drive can extend to all aspects of an existing social environment, even incorporating its strict limitations. In psychotherapy institutions during the late 1950s, "institutional analysis" emerged as a way to collectively discuss what psychoanalysis had kept private. Jacques Lacan's seminars provided intellectual groundwork for institutional psychology discussions. Felix Guattari joined the La Borde Clinic in 1956 as an advocate exploring desires under scrutiny. He wanted to shift the movement towards analyzing desire politically within institutions. Combining psychological analysis with custodial settings led to a collective approach addressing these issues.

The "regime of technical machines" describes a distinct division between tools used for production and their final products. These machines transfer value to the output but lose significance when they malfunction. In contrast, "desiring-machines," unlike regular machines, deteriorate during normal operation but perform optimally when broken down or dysfunctional. Artists often explore this desirable aspect in fantasies combining desire-driven production with social disruption and interference with conventional devices' reproduction functions. Examples include Arman's charred violins, Cesar's compressed car bodies, and Dali's critical paranoia approach that collectively spark "des" explosions.

The artist transforms objects into desire-driven entities called 'desiring-machines,' such as paranoiac machines, miraculating machines, celibate machines, and other technical machines. Desire-producing machines can create 'antiproduction' independently, while technical machines need external help for reproduction. This difference affects artworks' nature - art creates an immediate impact but destroys technical machines by preserving treasures within creations. Art itself is a desiring machine since the creator accumulates valuable assets to enhance its effect.

In simplified terms, the main idea in economics related to desires is called "desiring-machines." These imaginary constructs disregard boundaries between individuals and blur lines within their actions. Desires represent psychological suppression while societal rules govern social production. However, these two aspects are connected, leading to secondary psychological repression. Essentially, desiring machines and social production processes are intertwined despite functioning under separate systems.
