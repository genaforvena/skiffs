Summary: 

Yes, the work is a translation and has a separate copyright status to the applicable copyright protections of the original content. The longest-living author of this work died in 1939, which means that the work is in the public domain worldwide. The Gospel in Brief, on the other hand, is a work of fiction that was published in 1928, and its copyright protection expired in 1942. Therefore, the Gospel in Brief is still protected by copyright law in the United States and other countries where it is still in print.



Summarizing: less. This work may be in the public domain in countries and areas with longer native copyright terms that apply the rule of the shorter term to foreign works. THIS short exposition of the Gospel is a summary of a large work which exists in manuscript and cannot be published in Russia. That work consists of four parts: An account (Confession) of the course of my own life and of the thoughts which led me to the conviction that the Christian teaching contains the truth. An examination of the Christian teaching: first according to its interpretation by the Orthodox Russo-Greek Church, then according to its interpretation by the Church in general—by the Apostles, the Councils, the so-called Fathers of the Church—and an exposure of what is false in those interpretations. An examination of Christian teaching not according to those interpretations but solely according to what has come down to us of Christ's teaching, as ascribed to him in the Gospels. An exposition of the real meaning of Christ's teaching, the reasons why it has been perverted, and the consequences to which it should lead. From the third of those parts the present account has been compiled. The harmonization of the four Gospels has been in accord with the sense of the

The Gospel of Mark is a summary of a large work that exists in manuscript and cannot be published in Russia.

Summarizing: teaching. In making it I hardly had to digress from the order in which it is set down in the Gospels, so that there are not more but fewer transpositions of the verses than in most of the concordances known to me, or than in Grechulévich's arrangement of the Four Gospels. In my treatment of the Gospel of John there are no transpositions, but everything follows the order of the original. The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters (or six if each two be united) came about of itself from the sense of the teaching. This is the meaning of those chapters: Man is the son of an infinite source: a son of that Father not by the flesh but by the spirit. Therefore man should serve that source in spirit. The life of all men has a divine origin. It alone is holy. Therefore man should serve that source in the life of all men. Such is the will of the Father. The service of the will of that Father of life gives life. Therefore the gratification of one's own will is not necessary for life. Temporal life is food for the true life. Therefore the true life is independent of time: it is in the present. Time is an illusion of life; life in the past and in the future conceals from men the true life of the present. Therefore man should strive to destroy the illusion of the temporal life of the past and

Summary: 

To extract the main idea from a text, you would need to follow the order in which it is set down in the Gospels. This means that there are fewer transpositions of verses than in most concordances known to you. The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters came about of itself from the sense of the teaching, which was to present the life and teachings of Jesus in a chronological order. This approach allows for a more coherent and meaningful reading of the text, as it allows for a more focused and intentional reading of the Gospel.



Summarizing: future. True life is life in the present, common to all men and manifesting itself in love. Therefore he who lives by love in the present, through the common life of all men, unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life. So each two chapters are related as cause and effect. In addition to these twelve chapters an introduction from the first chapter of the Gospel of John is added, in which the writer of that Gospel speaks, in his own name, as to the meaning of the whole teaching, and a conclusion from the same writer's Epistle (written probably before the Gospel) containing a general deduction from all that precedes. These two parts do not form an essential part of the teaching, but though they both might be omitted without losing the sense of the teaching (the more so as they come in the name of John and not of Jesus)—I have retained them because in a straightforward understanding of Christ's teaching these parts, confirming one another an the whole, furnish, in contradiction to the queer interpretation of the Churches, the plainest indication of the meaning that should be ascribed to the teaching. At the beginning of each chapter, besides a brief indication of its subject, I have given the words which correspond to that chapter from the prayer Jesus taught his

Summary: 

The text "True Life is Life in the Present, Common to All Men, and Unites with the Father, the Source and Foundation of Life" is a short summary of a longer work, which is a book called "The Life of Christ" by John Chrysostom. The book is a collection of sermons and homilies written by Chrysostom, a bishop and theologian in the Byzantine Empire. The main idea of the book is that true life is life in the present, common to all men, and unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life. The two chapters that are related as cause and effect are chapter 11 (on the resurrection) and chapter 12 (on



Summarizing: disciples. When I had finished my work I found to my surprise and joy that the Lord's Prayer is nothing but a very concise expression of the whole teaching of Jesus in the very order in which I had arranged the chapters, and that each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters: 1. Our Father, Man is a son of God. 2. Which art in Heaven, God is the infinite spiritual source of life. 3. Hallowed be Thy Name, May this source of life be held holy. 4. Thy Kingdom come, May his power be realized in all men. 5. Thy will be done, as in heaven, May the will of this infinite source be fulfilled as it is in himself, 6. so on earth. so also in the bodily life. 7. Give us our daily bread Temporal life is the food of the true life. 8. each day. True life is in the present. 9. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And let not the mistakes and errors of the past hide that true life from us. 10. And lead us not into temptation, And may they not lead us into delusion, 11. But deliver us from evil, And so there shall be no evil. 12. For thine is the kingdom the power, and the glory. And may thy power, and strength, and wisdom, prevail. In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down without any

Summary: 

In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down without any errors. Each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters. This means that the author has carefully selected and arranged the material from the Gospels in a way that reflects the overall structure and message of the biblical narrative. The prayer is a meditation on the life and teachings of Jesus, and it is designed to help readers understand and appreciate the significance of each chapter. By following the prayer's structure and themes, readers can gain a deeper understanding of the Gospels as a whole and of the life and teachings of Jesus.



Summarizing: omissions. But in the present rendering the following are omitted: the conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, his mother's flight with him to Egypt; his miracles at Cana and Caperaum; the casting out of the devils; the walking on the sea; the blasting of the fig-tree; the healing of the sick; the raising of the dead; the resurrection of Christ himself, and the references to prophecies fulfilled by his life. Those passages are omitted in the present short exposition because, containing nothing of the teaching but only describing events that took place before, during, or after the period in which Jesus taught, they complicate the exposition. Those verses, however they may be understood, do not contain either contradiction or confirmation of the teaching. Their sole significance for Christianity was to prove the divinity of Jesus to those who did not believe in it. But for one who understands that a story of miracles is unconvincing, and who also doubts that the divinity of Jesus is asserted in his teaching, those verses drop away of themselves as superfluous. In the larger work every deviation from the ordinary version, as well as every inserted comment and every omission, is explained and justified by comparison of the different variants of the Gospels, by examination of contexts, and by philological and other

Summary: 

In the larger work, every deviation from the ordinary version, as well as every inserted comment and every omission, is explained and justified by comparison of the different variants of the Gospels. The following are omitted in the present rendering:

1. The conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, and the birth of Jesus' mother. These events are not included in the larger work because they are not found in the original Gospels.

2. The Gospel of John, which is not included in the larger work



Summarizing: considerations. In the present brief rendering all such proofs and refutations of the false understanding of the Churches, as well as the detailed notes and references, are omitted, on the ground that however exact and correct the discussions of each separate passage may be, they cannot carry conviction as to the true understanding of the teaching. The justness of the understanding of the teaching is better proved not by the discussion of particular passages but by its own unity, clarity, simplicity and completeness, and by its accordance with the inner feeling of all who seek the truth. In respect of all the divergences of my rendering from the Church's authorized text, the reader should not forget that the customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error. The reader should remember that Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato, Philo, or Marcus Aurelius did; nor even, like Socrates, transmitted his teaching to educated men, but that he spoke to many uneducated men and only long after his death did people begin to write down what they had heard about

Summary: 

The customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error. Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato, Philo, or Marcus Aurelius did. The Gospels are the accounts of Jesus' life, ministry, and teachings, written by eyewitnesses who were present at the events they describe. They are not works of fiction or propaganda, but are based on the firsthand accounts of the people who knew Jesus. The Gospels are considered sacred because they contain the words and deeds of Jesus, which are believed to have been divinely inspired and to have been preserved for us by the Holy Spirit.



Summarizing: him. The reader should remember that there were very many such accounts from among which the Churches selected first three Gospels and then one more, and that in selecting those best Gospels—as the proverb, 'There is no stick without knots' says—they had to take in many knots with what they selected from the whole mass of writings about Christ, and that there are many passages in the canonical Gospels just as poor as in the rejected apocryphal ones. The reader should remember that it is the teaching of Christ which may be sacred, but certainly not any definite number of verses and syllables, and that certain verses picked out from here to there cannot become sacred merely because people say they are. Moreover the reader should remember that these selected Gospels are also the work of thousands of different human brains and hands, that they have been selected, added to, and commented on, for centuries, that all the copies that have come down to us from the fourth century are written in continuous script without punctuation, so that even after the fourth and fifth centuries they have been subject to very diverse readings, and that there are not less than fifty thousand such variations of the Gospels. This should all be borne in mind by the reader, that he may not be misled by the customary view that the Gospels in their present form have come to us direct from the Holy

Summary: 

Yes, there are many passages in the canonical Gospels that are just as poor as the rejected apocryphal ones. This is because the Gospels are not considered to be sacred texts, and their teachings are not considered to be infallible. The Gospels are considered to be historical accounts of Jesus' life and teachings, and their accuracy and reliability are subject to debate and interpretation. While some passages may be considered more important or significant than others, the overall message and teachings of Jesus are considered to be of utmost importance and should not be compromised or distorted.



Summarizing: Ghost. The reader should remember that far from it being blameworthy to discard useless passages from the Gospels and elucidate some passages by others, it is on the contrary irrational not to do so and to hold a certain number of verses and syllables as sacred. On the other hand I beg readers to remember that if I do not regard the Gospels as sacred books that have come down to us from the Holy Ghost, even less do I regard them as mere historical monuments of religious literature. I understand the theological as well as the historical view of the Gospels, but regard them myself differently, and so I beg the reader not to be confused either by the church view or by the historical view customary in our day among educated people, neither of which do I hold. I regard Christianity neither as an inclusive divine revelation nor as an historical phenomenon, but as a teaching which gives us the meaning of

Summary: 

To extract the main idea from a text, you should first identify the central theme or message of the passage. This can be done by focusing on the key words, phrases, or sentences that convey the main idea. For example, if the passage is about the resurrection of Jesus, you might focus on the phrase "from the dead" or "resurrection" to identify the central theme.

Once you have identified the main idea, you can then focus on the supporting evidence or arguments that support it. This can include quotes, paraphrases, and other literary devices that support the central idea. For example, if the



Summarizing: life. I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this—that when I was fifty years old, having asked myself and all the learned men around me what I am and what is the meaning of my life, and received the answer that I am a fortuitous concatenation of atoms and that life has no meaning but is itself an evil, I fell into despair and wanted to put an end to my life; but I remembered that formerly in childhood when I believed, life had a meaning for me, and that for the great mass of men about me who believe and are not corrupted by riches life has a meaning; and I doubted the validity of the reply given me by the learned men of my circle and I tried to understand the reply Christianity gives to those who live a real life. And I began to seek Christianity in the Christian teaching that guides such men's lives. I began to study the Christianity which I saw applied in life and to compare that applied Christianity with its source. The source of Christian teaching is the Gospels, and in them I found the explanation of the spirit which guides the life of all who really

Summary: 

The text "I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this" "I began to study the Christianity which I saw applied in life and to compare that applied Christianity with its source" refers to the author's personal journey towards Christianity. The author begins by stating that they were led to Christianity by "this" (the Bible), which they saw applied in their life. They then compare this Christianity to its source, which is the Bible. The text highlights the author's personal journey towards Christianity, which is not based on theological or historical investigations.



Summarizing: live. But together with this source of the pure water of life I found, wrongfully united with it, mud and slime which had hidden its purity from me: by the side of and bound up with the lofty Christian teaching I found a Hebrew and a Church teaching alien to it. I was in the position of a man who receives a bag of stinking dirt, and only after long struggle and much labor finds that amid that dirt lie priceless pearls; and he understands that he was not to blame for disliking the stinking dirt, and that those who have collected and preserved these pearls together with the dirt are also not to blame but deserve love and respect. I did not know the light and had thought there was no light of truth to be found in life, but having convinced myself that men live by that light alone, I began to look for its source and found it in the Gospels, despite the false Church interpretations. And on reaching that source of light I was dazzled by it, and found full replies to my questions as to the meaning of my own life and that of others—answers in full agreement with those I knew of from other nations, but which in my opinion were superior to them

Summary: 

Your goal is to extract the main idea from a text. 

Your always return only edited and short summary of the text.

In this case, your goal is to extract the main idea of the text "The Light and the Darkness" by William Shakespeare. The text discusses the contrast between light and darkness, and the author uses this contrast to explore the nature of human existence and the search for truth.

The main idea of the text is that there is no absolute truth, and that men live by the light they find in the Gospels, despite the false interpretations of the Church. This idea is conveyed through the contrast between the light of Christ and the darkness of the false



Summarizing: all. I was looking for an answer to the question of life and not to theological or historical questions, and so for me the chief question was not whether Jesus was or was not God, or from whom the Holy Ghost proceeded and so forth, and equally unimportant and unnecessary was it for me to know when and by whom each Gospel was written and whether such and such a parable may, or may not, be ascribed to Christ. What was important to me was this light which has enlightened mankind for eighteen hundred years and which enlightened and still enlightens me; but how to name the source of that light, and what materials he or someone else had kindled, did not concern me. On that this preface might end were the Gospels recently discovered books and had Christ's teaching not suffered eighteen hundred years of false interpretation. But now to understand the teaching of Jesus it is necessary to know clearly the chief methods used in these false interpretations. The most customary method of false interpretation, and one which we have grown up with, consists of preaching under the name of Christianity not what Christ taught but a church teaching composed of explanations of very contradictory writings into which Christ's teaching enters only to a small degree, and even then distorted and twisted to fit together with other

Summary: 

To name the source of that light, you could refer to the author's statement that it was "kindled" by someone else. This would suggest that the light was not created by God or any other divine being, but rather by a human being or group of humans. Alternatively, you could refer to the light as "the light," which would be a generic term for any source of illumination or guidance.

As for the materials used to kindle the light, this would depend on the specific context in which the light was first described. In the context of the Bible, the light is often associated with the burning bush in the desert, which was



Summarizing: writings. According to this false interpretation Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations beginning with the commencement of the world and continuing in the Church until now. These false interpreters call Jesus God; but the fact that they recognize him as God does not make them attribute more importance to his words and teaching than to the words of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, the Apocalypse, or even to the decisions of the Councils and the writings of the Fathers of the Church. These false interpreters do not admit any understanding of the teaching of Jesus which does not conform to the previous and subsequent revelations; so that their aim is not to explain the meaning of Christ's teaching, but as far as possible to harmonize various extremely contradictory writings, such as the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Acts—that is, all that is supposed to constitute the Holy Scriptures. Such explanations aiming not at truth but at reconciling the irreconcilable, namely, the writings of the Old and the New Testament, can obviously be innumerable, as indeed they are. Among them are the Epistles of Paul and the decisions of the Councils (which begin with the formulary: 'It has pleased Us and the Holy Ghost'), and such enactments as those of the Popes, the Synods, the pseudo-Christs, and all the false interpreters who affirm that the Holy Ghost speaks through their

Summary: 

According to the false interpretation, Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations that began with the commencement of the world and continued in the Church until now. These false interpreters do not attribute more importance to Christ's words and teaching than the words of the Pentateuch, which are considered to be the first five books of the Bible. The false interpretation suggests that Christ's teaching is not as important as the teachings of the Old Testament, which are considered to be the foundation of Christianity. This false interpretation is a form of anti-Christian propaganda that seeks to



Summarizing: lips. They all employ one and the same gross method of affirming the truth of their interpretations by the assertion that their interpretations are not human utterances but revelations from the Holy Ghost. Without entering on an examination of these beliefs, each of which calls itself the true one, one cannot help seeing that by the method common to them all of acknowledging the whole immense quantity of so-called scriptures of the Old and New Testament as equally sacred, they themselves impose an insuperable obstacle to an understanding of Christ's teaching; and that from this mistake arises the possibility and inevitability of endlessly divergent interpretations of the teaching. The reconcilement of a number of revelations can be infinitely varied, but the interpretation of the teaching of one person (and one looked upon as God) should not occasion discord. If God descended to earth to teach people, his teaching, by the very purpose of his coming, cannot be understood in more than one way. If God came down to earth to reveal truth to men, at least he would have revealed it so that all might understand: if he did not do that he was not God; and if the divine truths are such that even God could not make them intelligible to mankind, men certainly cannot do so. If Jesus is not God, but a great man, then still less can his teaching produce

Summary: 

The first sentence of the text is a quote from the book of Hebrews, which is a letter written by the apostle Paul to the Hebrews, a Jewish community in the Roman Empire. The quote emphasizes the importance of understanding the teaching of one person (God) in a single way, as it cannot be understood in more than one way. This quote is a reflection of the Christian belief that God's teachings are not subject to interpretation, and that his message is unchanging and universal.

The second sentence of the text, "If God descended to earth to teach people, his teaching, by the very purpose of his coming, cannot be understood in more than one way," is



Summarizing: discord. For the teaching of a great man is only great because it expresses intelligibly and clearly what others have expressed unintelligibly and obscurely. What is incomprehensible in a great man's teaching is not great, and therefore a great man's teaching does not engender sects. Only an exposition which affirms that it is a revelation from the Holy Ghost and is the sole truth, and that all other expositions are lies, gives birth to discord and to the mutual animosities among the Churches that result therefrom. However much the various Churches affirm that they do not condemn other communities, that they have no hatred of them but pray for union, it is untrue. Never, since the time of Arius, has the affirmation of any dogma arisen from any other cause than the desire to condemn a contrary belief as false. It is a supreme degree of pride and ill will to others to assert that a particular dogma is a divine revelation proceeding from the Holy Ghost: the highest presumption because nothing more arrogant can be said than that the words spoken by me are uttered through me by God; and the greatest ill will because the avowal of oneself as in possession of the sole indubitable truth implies an assertion of the falsity of all who disagree. Yet that is just what all the Churches say, and from this alone flows and has flowed all the evil which has been committed and still is committed in the world in the name of

Summary: 

The teaching of a great man is only great because it expresses intelligibly and clearly what others have expressed unintelligibly and obscurely. This is because great thinkers have always been motivated by a desire to condemn a contrary belief as false, rather than by any other cause. This is evident in the works of philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates, who were all known for their ability to explain complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. Their teachings have had a profound impact on Western culture, inspiring generations of thinkers and influencing the development of various fields, from science to politics



Summarizing: religion. But besides the temporary evil which such an interpretation by the Churches and the sects produces, it has another important inner defect which gives an obscure, indefinite, and insincere character to their assertions. This defect consists in the fact that all the Churches—having acknowledged the latest revelation of the Holy Ghost, who descended on the apostles and has passed and still passes to the supposedly elect—nowhere define directly, definitely, and finally, in what that revelation consists; and yet they base their belief on that supposedly continuing revelation and call it Christian. All the churchmen who acknowledge the revelation from the Holy Ghost recognize (like the Mohammedans) three revelations: that of Moses, of Jesus, and of the Holy Ghost. But in the Mohammedan religion it is believed that after Moses and Jesus, Mahomet is the last of the prophets and that he explained the revelations of Moses and Jesus, and this revelation of Mahomet every True Believer has before him. But it is not so with the Church faith. That also, like the Mohammedan, acknowledges three revelations: that of Moses, of Jesus, and of the Holy Ghost, but it does not call itself Holy Ghostism after the name of the last revealer, but affirms that the basis of its faith is the teaching of Christ. So that while preaching its own doctrines it attributes their authority to

Summary: 

 The Mohammedan religion, also known as Islam, believes that after the prophets Moses and Jesus, Muhammad is the last of the prophets. This belief is reflected in the text, where it attributes the authority of its own doctrines to Muhammad. This is evident in the statement "So that while preaching its own doctrines it attributes their authority to Mahomet." The use of the word "Mahomet" here suggests that the religion is claiming to be the last and most authoritative of all prophets. This is further reinforced by the fact that the religion attributes its own doctrines to Muhammad, which is a common practice in Islamic theology.



Summarizing: Christ. Churchmen acknowledging the last revelation explaining all previous ones, should say so and call their religion by the name of whoever received the last revelation— acknowledging it to be that of Paul, or of this or that Council of the Church, or of the Pope, or of the Patriarch. And if the last revelation was that of the Fathers, a decree of the Eastern Patriarchs, a Papal encyclical, or the syllabus or catechism of Luther or of Philaret—they should say so and call their religion accordingly, because the last revelation which explains all the preceding is always the most important one. But they do not do so, but while preaching doctrines quite alien to Christ's teaching, affirm that their doctrine was taught by Christ. So that according to their teaching Jesus declared that by his blood he had redeemed the human race ruined by Adam's sins; that God is three persons; that the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles and was transmitted to the priesthood by the laying on of hands; that seven sacraments are necessary for salvation; that communion should be received in two kinds, and so on. They would have us believe that all this is the teaching of Jesus, whereas in reality there is not a word about any of it in his

Summary: 

 The given text is a response to a question about the use of the term "Churchmen" in a religious context. The author is responding to the question by stating that churchmen acknowledging the last revelation explaining all previous ones should call their religion by the name of whoever received it, but instead, they do not do so. The author suggests that while preaching doctrines, they affirm that their own doctrine is not Christ's teaching, but rather alien to it. The author's response highlights the tension between theological and doctrinal differences within a particular religious community, and the need for clarity and consistency in religious discourse



Summarizing: teaching. Those false teachers should call their teaching and religion the teaching and religion of the Holy Ghost but not of Christ; for only that faith can be called Christian which recognizes the revelation of Christ reaching us in the Gospels as the final revelation. It would seem that the matter is plain and not worth speaking about, but, strange to say, up to now the teaching of Christ is not separated on the one side from an artificial and quite unjustifiable amalgamation with the Old Testament, and on the other from the arbitrary additions and perversions made in the name of the Holy Ghost. To this day there are some who, calling Jesus the second person of the Trinity, do not conceive of his teaching otherwise than in conjunction with those pseudo revelations of the third Person which they find in the Old Testament, the Epistles, the decrees of the Councils and the decisions of the Fathers, and they preach the strangest beliefs, affirming them to be the religion of Christ. Others not acknowledging Jesus as God, similarly conceive of his teaching not as he could have taught it but as understood by Paul and other commentators. While regarding Jesus not as God but as a man, these commentators deny him a most legitimate human right, that of answering only for his own words and not for false interpretations of them. Trying to explain his teaching, these learned commentators attribute to Jesus things he never thought of

Summary: 

 The teaching of Christ is not separated from the Old Testament and the additions and perversions made in the name of the Holy Ghost in the teaching of Christ. This is a common misconception that has arisen due to the historical context in which the Bible was written.

The Old Testament is a collection of books that were written by various authors over a period of several centuries. These books contain the stories of the Israelites' history, law, and prophets. The Old Testament is not a separate entity from the New Testament, but rather it is a part of the same canon of scripture.

The New Testament, on the other hand, is a



Summarizing: saying. The representatives of this school of interpreters—beginning with the most popular of them, Renan—without troubling to separate what Jesus himself taught from what the slanders of his commentators have laid upon him, and without troubling to understand his teaching more profoundly, try to understand the meaning of his appearance and the spread of his teaching by the events of his life and the circumstances of his time. The problem that confronts them is this: eighteen hundred years ago a certain pauper appeared and said certain things. He was flogged and executed. And ever since that time (though there have been numbers of just men who died for their faith), milliards of people, wise and foolish, learned and ignorant, have clung to the belief that this man alone among men was God. How is this amazing fact to be explained? The churchmen say that it occurred because Jesus was God. In that case it is all understandable. But if he was not God how are we to explain that everyone looked upon just this common man as God? And the learned men of that school assiduously explore every detail of the life of Jesus, without noticing that however much they explore those details (in reality they have gathered none), even if they were able to reconstruct his whole life in the minutest detail, the question why he, just he, had such an influence on people would still remain

Summary: 

Renan and Renan are two renowned interpreters of Jesus' teachings who aim to understand the meaning of his appearance and the spread of his teaching by the events of his life and circumstances of his time. They are among the most popular interpreters of Jesus' teachings, and their work has been widely recognized and appreciated by scholars and the general public alike.

Renan's approach to understanding Jesus' teachings is based on his interpretation of the Gospel accounts, which he sees as a historical record of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. He believes that the Gospel accounts provide a comprehensive and accurate account of Jesus' teachings and the events that shaped his life and ministry.





Summarizing: unanswered. The answer is not to be found in knowledge of the society Jesus was born into, or how he was educated, and so on, still less is it to be found in knowledge of what was being done in Rome, or in the fact that the people of that time were inclined to superstition, but only by knowing what this man preached that has caused people, from that time to this, to distinguish him from all others and to acknowledge him as God. It would seem that the first thing to do is to try to understand that man's teaching, and naturally his own teaching and not coarse interpretations of it that have been spread since his time. But this is not done. These learned historians of Christianity are so pleased to have understood that Jesus was not God and are so anxious to prove that his teaching is not divine and is therefore not obligatory, that—forgetting that the more they prove him to have been an ordinary man and his teaching not to be divine the further they are from solving the problem before them—they strain all their strength to do so. To see this surprising error clearly, it is worth recalling an article by Havet, a follower of Renan's, who affirms that Jésus Christ n'avait rien de chrétien, or Souris, who enthusiastically argues that Jesus Christ was a very coarse and stupid

Summary: 

Historians of Christianity are not pleased to have understood that Jesus was not God, as they are anxious to prove that his teaching is not divine. This is because they have strained all their strength to find a way to prove that his teaching is not divine. The answer to this question is not to be found in knowledge of the society Jesus was born into or how he was educated, but only by knowing what Jesus preached. This is because Jesus' teachings are the foundation of Christianity, and any attempt to disprove them is a disservice to the faith.



Summarizing: man. The essential thing is, not to prove that Jesus was not God and that therefore his doctrine is not divine, or to prove that he was a Catholic, but to know in all its purity what constituted that teaching which was so lofty and so precious to men that they have acknowledged and still acknowledge its preacher to have been God. And so if the reader belongs to the great majority of educated people brought up in the Church belief but who have abandoned its incompatibilities with common sense and conscience—whether he has retained a love and respect for the spirit of the Christian teaching or (as the proverb puts it 'has thrown his fur coat into the fire because he is angry with the bugs') considers all Christianity a harmful superstition—I ask him to remember that what repels him and seems to him a superstition is not the teaching of Christ; that Christ cannot be held responsible for the monstrous tradition that has been interwoven with his teaching and presented as Christianity: that to judge of Christianity, only the teaching of Christ as it has come down to us must be learned—that is, the words and actions attributed to Christ and that have an instructive

Summary: 

 The given text is a summary of a passage from the book "The Life and Morals of Jesus Christ" by John Newton. The passage discusses the importance of Christ's teaching and its impact on the world. The author argues that Christ cannot be held responsible for the monstrous tradition that has been interwoven with his teaching, as it was precious to men and they have acknowledged his preacher to be God. The passage emphasizes the essential nature of Christ's teaching and its relevance to the world today.



Summarizing: meaning. Studying the teaching of Christ in that way the reader will convince himself that Christianity, far from being a mixture of the lofty and the low, or a superstition, is a very strict, pure, and complete metaphysical and ethical doctrine, higher than which the reason of man has not yet reached, and in the orbit of which (without recognizing the fact) human activity—political, learned, poetic, and philosophic—is moving. If the reader belongs to that small minority of educated people who hold to the Church religion and profess it not for outward purposes but for inward tranquillity, I ask him to remember that the teaching of Christ as set forth in this book (despite the identity of name) is quite a different teaching from that which he professes, and that therefore the question for him is not whether the doctrine here offered agrees or disagrees with his belief, but is simply, which best accords with his reason and conscience—the Church teaching composed of adjustments of many scriptures, or the teaching of Christ alone? The question for him is merely whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own

Summary: 

 The teaching of Christ as set forth in this book is a different teaching from that which he professes. The question for Christ is whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own meaning. This is a different teaching from the one that Christ professes, as he has already stated that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and the Savior of the world. Therefore, the question for Christ is whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own meaning.



Summarizing: belief. But if the reader is one of those who outwardly profess the Church creed and values it not because he believes it to be true but because he considers that to profess and preach it is profitable to him, then let him remember that however many adherents he may have, however powerful they may be, on whatever thrones they may sit, and by whatever great names they may call themselves, he is not one of the accusers but of the

Summary: 

The reader is one of those who outwardly profess the Church creed and values it not because they believe it to be true but because it is profitable to them. This reader is not one of the accusers, who are those who accuse others of heresy or who seek to discredit the Church. Instead, they are those who profess the Church's teachings out of a desire to benefit themselves or others. The reader is not a member of the Church, but they are a witness to its teachings and values. They are not a member of the Church because they believe it to be true, but because they believe it to be profitable.



Summarizing: accused. Let such readers remember that there is nothing for them to prove, that they have long ago said what they had to say and that even if they could prove what they wish to, they would only prove, each for himself, what is proved by all the hundreds of opposing Churches; and that it is not for them to demonstrate, but to excuse themselves: to excuse themselves for the blasphemy of adjusting the teaching of the God-Christ to suit the teaching of Ezras, of the Councils, and Theophilacts, and allowing themselves to interpret and alter the words of God in conformity with the words of men; to excuse themselves for their libels on God by which they have thrown all the fanaticism they had in their hearts onto the God-Jesus and given it out as his teaching; to excuse themselves for the fraud by which, having hidden the teaching of God who came to bestow blessing on the world, they have replaced it by their own blasphemous creed, and by that substitution have deprived and still deprive milliards of people of the blessing Christ brought to men, and instead of the peace and love he brought have introduced into the world sects, condemnations, murders, and all manner of crimes. For such readers there are only two ways out: humble confession and renunciation of their lies, or a persecution of those who expose them for what they have done and are still

Summary: 

The quote from the book "The Church of England and the Church of Scotland" by John Henry Newman is about the importance of not proving one's own beliefs or opinions. The author argues that even if one were to prove their beliefs, they would only be proving what is already known and accepted by other Churches. This quote emphasizes the idea that one should not seek to prove their own beliefs or opinions, but rather focus on the truth and the evidence that supports them.



Summarizing: doing. If they will not disavow their lies, only one thing remains for them: to persecute me—for which I, completing what I have written, prepare myself with joy and with fear of my own weakness. LEO TOLSTÓY. YÁSNAYA POLYÁNA, 1883.

Summary: 

In the year 1883, the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy published his novel "Yasna Polyana," which is a collection of short stories about the life of a peasant family. The novel is known for its focus on the spiritual and moral values of the Russian Orthodox Church, and its exploration of the themes of love, sacrifice, and redemption.

The novel is divided into three parts, each of which focuses on a different aspect of the family's life. The first part, "The Cossack," tells the story of a young peasant boy named Ivan who is sent to the Cossack army to fight against the Turks. The second part, "The Pe

But before they began to live as man and wife it appeared that Mary was pregnant. Joseph however was a good man and did not wish to shame her: he took her as his wife and had no relations with her till she had given birth to her first son and had named him

Summary: 

The passage I provided is from the novel "The Enlightenment" by J.R.R. Tolkien. The main idea of the passage is that only those who understand the concept of enlightenment can become like it. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding and embodying the ideals of enlightenment, which are based on reason, logic, and critical thinking. The passage suggests that those who do not understand these concepts are not capable of becoming like the enlightened, and that only those who do can become truly enlightened. The novel explores the themes of human nature, the nature of knowledge, and the quest for understanding.



Summarizing: Jesus. And the boy grew and matured and was intelligent beyond his years. When Jesus was twelve years old Mary went once with Joseph for the holiday at Jerusalem and took the boy with her. When the holiday was over they started homeward and forgot about the boy. Then they remembered, but thought he had gone with other lads, and on the way they inquired about him but he was nowhere to be found, so they went back for him to Jerusalem. And not till the third day did they find the boy in the church, where he was sitting with the teachers and asking questions. And everyone was surprised at his intelligence. His mother saw him and said: 'What have you done to us? Your father and I have been looking for you and grieving.' And he said to them: 'But where did you look for me? Surely you knew that a son should be looked for in his Father's house?' And they did not understand him, nor did they understand whom he called his Father. And after this Jesus lived with his mother and obeyed her in everything. And he advanced in stature and in intelligence. And everyone thought that Jesus was the son of Joseph. And so he lived to the age of thirty. At that time a prophet John announced himself in Judea. He lived in the open country of Judea near the Jordan. His dress was of camelhair belted with a strap, and he fed on bark and on

Summary: 

The passage is about Mary's visit to Jerusalem with her husband Joseph and their son Jesus at the age of twelve. The passage describes how Mary took Jesus with her on this trip and how he grew and matured. It also mentions that Jesus lived with his mother and obeyed her in everything. The passage ends with Jesus living with his mother and obeying her in everything.



Summarizing: herbs. John said: Bethink yourselves, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. He called on the people to change their lives and get rid of wickedness, and as a sign of that change of life he bathed them in the Jordan. He said: A voice calls to you; Open a way for God through the wilderness, level a path for him. Make it so that all may be level, that there may be neither hollows nor hills, neither high nor low. Then God will be among you and all will find salvation. And the people asked him: What must we do? He replied: Let him that has two suits of clothes give one to him that has none, and let him that has food give to him that has none. And tax-gatherers came to him and asked: What are we to do? He said to them: Extort nothing beyond what is due. And soldiers asked: How are we to live? He said: Do no one any harm, nor defraud any man, and be content with what is served out to you. And inhabitants of Jerusalem came to him, and the Jews in the neighbourhood of Judea near the Jordan. And they acknowledged their wrong-doings to him, and as a sign of a changed life he bathed them in the Jordan. And many of the Orthodox and conventional religionists came to John, but

Summary: 

John's message to the people of his time was to repent and change their lives, as a sign of a changed life, he bathed them in the Jordan River. This was a significant event in the history of the region, as it marked the beginning of the Messianic era, which was prophesied in the Old Testament. The message of John's baptism was that the Kingdom of God was at hand, and that those who repented and changed their lives would be welcomed into the Kingdom. This message was a call to action for the people of his time, and it remains relevant today as a reminder of the importance of repentance and transformation in our lives.



Summarizing: secretly. He recognized them and said: You are a race of vipers: or have you also seen that you cannot escape the will of God? Then bethink yourselves and change your faith! And if you wish to change your faith let it be seen by your fruits that you have bethought yourselves. The axe is already laid to the tree. If the tree produces bad fruit it will be cut down and cast into the fire. As a sign of a changed life I cleanse you in water, but as well as that bathing you must also be cleansed with the spirit. The spirit will cleanse you as a master cleanses his threshing-floor when he gathers the wheat and burns the chaff. Jesus, too, came from Galilee to the Jordan to be bathed by John, and was bathed and heard John's preaching. And from the Jordan he went into the wild places and there felt the power of the spirit. Jesus remained in the desert forty days and forty nights without food or drink. And the voice of the flesh said to him: If you were the son of Almighty God you could make bread out of stones, but you cannot do so, therefore you are not a son of God. But Jesus said to himself: If I cannot make bread out of stones, it means that I am not a son of God in the flesh but in the spirit. I am alive not by bread but by the

Summary: 

The passage above is a paraphrase of the text material. The original text is: "Jesus remained in the desert forty days and forty nights without food or drink. Jesus recognized them and said: You are a race of vipers. Then bethink yourselves and change your faith!"

The main idea of the passage is that Jesus recognized the people who came to Him and said that they were a race of vipers. This recognition is seen as a sign of Jesus' compassion and mercy towards them. Jesus then challenges their faith by saying that they are a race of vipers, which implies that they are untrustworthy and deceitful. This challenge is seen as a call to repentance and a



Summarizing: spirit. And my spirit is able to disregard the flesh. But still hunger tormented him, and the voice of the flesh again said to him: If you live only by the spirit and can disregard the flesh, you can throw off the flesh and your spirit will remain alive. And it seemed to him that he was standing on the roof of the temple and the voice of the flesh said to him: If you are a son of God in the spirit, throw yourself from the temple, you will not hurt yourself, but an unseen force will keep you, support you, and save you from all harm. But Jesus said to himself: I can disregard the flesh, but I may not throw it off, for I was born by the spirit into the flesh. That was the will of the Father of my spirit, and I cannot oppose him. Then the voice of the flesh said to him: If you cannot oppose your Father by throwing yourself from the temple and discarding life, then you cannot oppose your Father by hungering when you need to eat. You must not make light of the desires of the flesh; they are placed in you, and you must serve them. Then Jesus seemed to see all the kingdoms of the earth and all the peoples, just as they live and labor for the flesh, expecting gain

Summary: 

Jesus' statement "I can disregard the flesh, but I may not throw it off, for I was born by the spirit into the flesh" implies that he is not willing to give up his human nature, which is a part of his divine nature. This statement highlights Jesus' understanding of his identity as a human being and his commitment to living a life of service and sacrifice for the sake of others.

The phrase "for I was born by the spirit into the flesh" emphasizes Jesus' connection to the divine and his willingness to embrace the limitations and challenges of human existence



Summarizing: therefrom. And the voice of the flesh said to him: There, you see, these people work for me and I give them what they wish for. If you will work for me you will have the same. But Jesus said to himself: My Father is not flesh but spirit. I live by him. I am always aware of his presence in me. Him alone I honor and for him alone I work, expecting reward from him alone. Then the temptations ceased and Jesus knew the power of the spirit. And when he had experienced the power of the spirit, Jesus went out of the wild places and came again to John and stayed with him. And when Jesus was leaving John, John said of him: That is the saviour of men. On hearing those words of John two of his pupils left their former teacher and went after Jesus. He, seeing them following him, stopped and said: What do you want? They replied: Teacher, we wish to be with you and to know your teaching. He said: Come with me and I will tell you everything. They went with him and stayed with him, listening to him till ten o'clock. One of these pupils was called Andrew. He had a brother Simon. Having heard Jesus, Andrew went to his brother Simon and said to him: We have found him of whom the prophets wrote—the Messiah—he has told us of our salvation. Andrew took Simon and brought him also to

Summary: 

The text describes two of Jesus' pupils who left their former teacher and went after him, hoping to learn from him. They said that they wished to be with him and to know his teaching, but Jesus told them to stay with him until ten o'clock. This suggests that the two pupils were persistent and eager to learn from Jesus, even after he had left his previous teacher. The fact that Jesus told them to stay with him until ten o'clock suggests that he believed they would be able to benefit from his teachings and that he wanted to give them the opportunity to ask him questions. Overall, the text highlights the



Summarizing: Jesus. Jesus called this brother of Andrew's, Peter, which means a stone. And both these brothers became pupils of Jesus. Afterwards, before entering Galilee, Jesus met Philip and called him to go with him. Philip was from Bethsaida and a fellow-villager of Peter and Andrew. When Philip had got to know Jesus he went and found his brother Nathanael and said to him: We have found the chosen of God of whom Moses and the prophets wrote. This is Jesus, the son of Joseph of Nazareth. Nathanael was surprised that he of whom the prophets wrote should be from a neighbouring village, and he said: It is most unlikely that the messenger of God should be from Nazareth. Philip said: Come with me, you shall see and hear for yourself. Nathaniel agreed and went with his brother and met Jesus, and when he had heard him he said to Jesus: Yes, now I see that it is true that you are a son of God and the King of Israel. Jesus said to him: Learn something more important than that: henceforth the heavens are opened and men may be in communion with the heavenly powers. Henceforth God will no longer be separate from men. And Jesus came home to Nazareth and on a holiday went as usual into the Assembly and began to read. They gave him the book of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling it he read. In the book was written: The spirit of the Lord is in

Summary: 

In the given text, the main idea is to extract the main idea from the text, which is the name of a brother of Andrew's named Peter. The text mentions that Jesus called this brother of Andrew's, Peter, which means a stone.



Summarizing: me. He has chosen me to announce happiness to the unfortunate and the brokenhearted, to announce freedom to those who are bound, light to the blind, and salvation and rest to the tormented, to announce to all men the day of God's mercy. He folded the book, returned it to the attendant, and sat down. And all waited to hear what he would say. And he said to them: That writing has now been fulfilled before your eyes. THE SERVICE OF GOD Therefore man should work not for the flesh, but for the spirit. 'which art in heaven' IT happened that Jesus was walking across a field with his pupils one Saturday. The pupils were hungry, and on the way they plucked ears of corn and rubbed them in their hands and ate the grain. But according to the teaching of the Orthodox, God had given Moses a law that everyone should observe Saturday and do nothing that day. According to the teaching of the Orthodox, God had ordered that anyone who worked on Saturday should be stoned. The Orthodox noticed that the pupils rubbed ears of corn on a Saturday and said to them: It is wrong to do that on a Saturday. One must not work on Saturday, and you are rubbing ears of corn. God made Saturday holy, and commanded that the breaking of it should be punished by

Summary: 

 According to the Orthodox teaching, God gave Moses a law that everyone should observe Saturday and do nothing that day. This law is known as the Sabbath or Shabbat, and it is considered a holy day in the Orthodox faith. The Orthodox believe that the Sabbath is a time for rest, reflection, and spiritual renewal, and that it is a reminder of God's creation and the importance of His creation.

The Orthodox also believe that the Sabbath is a time for doing no work or business on that day. This means that people should not work on Saturday, and they should not engage in any activities that require physical labor or manual labor. This includes things like farming, construction, and manufacturing.

In



Summarizing: death. Jesus heard this, and said: If you understood what is meant by the words of God: 'I desire love and not sacrifice'—you would not condemn what is harmless. Man is more important than Saturday. It happened another time on a Saturday that when Jesus was teaching in the Assembly a sick woman came to him and asked him to help her. And Jesus began to cure her. The Orthodox church-elder was angry with Jesus, and said to the people: In the law of God it is said: 'There are six days in the week on which to work.' But Jesus then asked the Orthodox professors of the law: Do you think it is wrong to help a man on Saturday? And they did not know what to answer. Then Jesus said: Deceivers! Does not each of you untie his ox from its manger and take it to water on Saturday? And if his sheep fell into a well would not any one of you pull it out even on Saturday? A man is much better than a sheep: yet you say that it is wrong to help a man. What then do you think we should do on Saturday—good or evil? Save life or destroy it? Good should be done always, even on Saturday. Jesus one day saw a tax-gatherer receiving taxes. The tax-gatherer's name was Matthew. Jesus talked to him and Matthew understood him, liked his teaching, and invited him to his house and showed him

Summary: 

The Orthodox church-elder was angry with Jesus because Jesus had said that in the law of God, it is said: "There are six days in the week on which to work." The Orthodox church-elder interpreted this verse to mean that only six days out of seven are considered work days, and that Jesus was contradicting the law. The Orthodox church-elder believed that Jesus was breaking the law by saying that there are six days in the week on which to work, and that this was a serious offense.



Summarizing: hospitality. When Jesus came to Matthew's house some of Matthew's friends were also there—tax-gatherers and unbelievers. Jesus did not disdain them, but he and his pupils sat down with them. And when the Orthodox saw him, they said to his pupils: How is it that your teacher eats with tax-gatherers and unbelievers? For according to the teaching of the Orthodox, God forbids any intercourse with unbelievers. Jesus heard this, and said: He who boasts of good health needs no doctor, but a sick man does. Understand what the words of God mean: 'I desire love and not sacrifice.' I cannot teach a change of faith to those who consider themselves Orthodox, but to those who consider themselves unbelievers. Some Orthodox professors of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. And they saw that his pupils, and Jesus himself, ate bread without having washed their hands, and these Orthodox began to blame him for that, for they themselves strictly observed the Church tradition as to how the dishes should be washed, and would not eat unless they had been so washed. And they would also not eat anything from the market until they had washed their hands. And the Orthodox professors of the law asked him: Why do you not follow the Church traditions, but take bread with unwashed hands and eat it? And he answered them: How is it that you with your Church traditions break God's commandment? God said to you: 'Honour your father and

Summary: 

The text is a piece of religious literature, written by an Orthodox professor of the law, who is discussing the behavior of Jesus's pupils and Jesus himself, who were eating bread without washing their hands. The Orthodox professors are blaming Jesus for this, as they themselves strictly observe how dishes should be washed. The text is a commentary on the behavior of Jesus's followers, and the Orthodox professors' criticism of it. The main idea of the text is the importance of proper hygiene and cleanliness in religious practices.



Summarizing: mother'. But you have arranged that anyone may say: 'I give to God what I used to give to my parents', and then he is not bound to feed his father and mother. So by the Church tradition you break the law of God. Deceivers! Well did the prophet Isaiah say of you: 'Because these people fall down before me only in words, and honour me only with their tongue, while their heart is far from me; and because their fear of me is only a human law which they have learnt by rote, I will do a wonderful, an extraordinary thing among them: the wisdom of their wise men shall be lost, and the understanding of their thinkers shall be dimmed. Woe to those who seek to hide their desires from the Highest, and who do their deeds in darkness.' So it is with you: You neglect what is important in the law—the commandment of God—but observe your own traditions as to the washing of cups! And Jesus called the people to him and said: Hear all of you and understand: there is nothing in the world that entering a man can defile him; but what goes forth from him, that can defile a man. Let love and mercy be in your soul, then all will be clean. Try to understand this. And when he returned home his pupils asked him what those words meant. And he said: Do you also not

Summary: 

Yes, you are correct. The Church tradition that you refer to is the one that states that anyone who gives to God what they used to give to their parents is not bound to feed their father and mother. This tradition is based on the idea that God is the ultimate source of all goodness and that giving to Him is the best way to show gratitude and love towards Him.

The Church tradition is not a law, but rather a tradition that has been passed down through the centuries and is considered to be a part of the Christian faith. It is not binding on anyone, as it is based on the belief that God is the ultimate source of all goodness and that giving to Him is the best way to show gratitude and love towards Him



Summarizing: understand? Do you not understand that what is external, bodily, cannot defile a man? For it does not enter his soul but his belly. It enters his belly and passes out again. Only that which goes out of him from his soul can defile a man. For out of a man's soul proceed evil, adulteries, obscenity, murders, thefts, covetousness, wrath, deceit, insolence, envy, calumny, pride, and every kind of folly. And this evil is out of man's soul and it alone can defile him. After this came the Passover, and Jesus went to Jerusalem and entered the temple. In the courts of the temple were cattle: cows, bulls, and sheep; and there were cotes for pigeons; and money-changers behind their counters. All this was wanted for offerings to God. The animals were killed and offered up in the Temple. That was how the Jews prayed, as they had been taught by the Orthodox professors of the law. Jesus went into the Temple, plaited a whip, drove all the cattle out of the porch, turned out all the doves, and scattered all the money, and bade them not bring such things into the

Summary: 

The given text is a quote from the Gospel of Matthew, which states that Jesus' statement "Do you not understand that what is external, bodily, cannot defile a man?" does not refer to the body but to the belly. The quote is not directly related to the main idea of the text, which is Jesus' teaching about the importance of living a righteous life.



Summarizing: Temple. He said: The prophet Isaiah said to you: 'The house of God is not the Temple in Jerusalem, but the whole world of God's people.' And the prophet Jeremiah also told you: 'Do not believe the falsehood that the house of God is here; do not believe this, but change your lives: do not judge falsely, do not oppress a stranger, a widow, or an orphan, do not shed innocent blood, and do not come into the house of God and say: Now we can quietly do evil. Do not make my house a den of thieves.' And the Jews objected and said: You say that our way of serving God is wrong. How can you prove that? And Jesus turned to them and said: Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise a new, living temple. And the Jews said: How can you suddenly build a new temple, when this one took forty years to build? And Jesus said to them: I speak to you of what is more important than the temple. You would not speak as you do if you understood the meaning of the prophet's words: 'I, God, do not rejoice in your sacrifices, but in your love of one another.' The living temple is the whole world of men when they love one another. And many people in Jerusalem believed in what he said. But he himself believed in nothing external for he knew that everything is within

Summary: 

The main idea of the text is that Jesus' statement that he would destroy the Temple and build a new one in three days is not the Temple in Jerusalem, but the entire world of God's people. This is evident from the prophet Isaiah's statement that the Temple in Jerusalem is not the whole world of God's people. The text emphasizes that the Temple is not the physical structure, but the people who are part of God's covenant community.



Summarizing: man. He had no need that anyone should give witness of man, for he knew that the spirit is in man. And Jesus had once to pass through Samaria. He came to the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the place that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, being tired by his journey, sat down by it while his pupils went into the town to fetch bread. And a woman came from Sychar to draw water, and Jesus asked her to give him to drink. She said to him: How is it that you ask me to give you water? For you Jews have no dealings with us Samaritans. But he said to her: If you knew me and knew what I teach you would not say that, but would give me to drink and I would give you the water of life. Whoever drinks of the water from this well will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water of life shall always be satisfied, and it will bring him to everlasting life. The woman understood that he was speaking of divine things, and said to him: I see that you are a prophet and wish to teach me. But how can you teach me divine things when you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan? Our people pray to God upon this mountain, but you Jews say that the house of God is only in

Summary: 

 The given text is a part of the Gospel of John, which is a part of the New Testament. The passage is about Jesus' encounter with a woman who is seeking to know him and his teachings. Jesus tells her that she does not need to testify of him, as he already knows that she is a sincere follower of him. He also tells her that she should not say that she knows him, as it would be a lie. This passage highlights Jesus' humility and his desire to be known only by his teachings and his love for his followers.



Summarizing: Jerusalem. You cannot teach me divine things, for you have one religion and we have another. Then Jesus said to her: Believe me, woman, the time has arrived when people will come neither to this mountain nor to Jerusalem to pray to the Father. The time has come when the real worshippers of God will honour the heavenly Father in spirit and by their works. The Father has need of such worshippers. The woman did not understand what he meant by saying that God is a spirit, and she said: I have heard that a messenger of God will come, he whom they call the anointed. He will tell us everything. Jesus said to her: It is I who am speaking to you. Do not expect anything more. After this Jesus came to the country of the Jews and lived there with his pupils and taught. At that time John was teaching near Salim, and bathing people in the river Enon, for he had not yet been imprisoned. And a dispute arose between John's pupils and those of Jesus as to which was better—John's cleansing by water, or the teaching of Jesus. And they came to John and said to him: You cleanse with water, but Jesus only teaches, and all go to him. What do you say about him? John said: A man can of himself teach nothing unless God teach him. He who speaks of the earth is of the earth, but he who speaks of God is from

Summary: 

 The given text is a summary of the passage "Jesus came to the country of the Jews and lived there with his pupils and taught" from the book of John. The passage describes Jesus' arrival in the country of the Jews, where he taught and taught near Salim, and near the river Enon. The passage also mentions John, who was teaching near Salim and bathing people in the river Enon. The summary provided in the text is a condensed version of the entire passage, highlighting the main idea of Jesus' arrival in the country of the Jews and his teachings.



Summarizing: God. It cannot be proved whether spoken words are from God or not from God. God is a spirit; He cannot be measured and cannot be proved. He who understands the words of the spirit proves thereby that he is of the spirit. The Father, loving his son, has entrusted everything to him. He who believes in the son has life, but he who does not believe in the son has no life. God is the spirit in man. After this one of the Orthodox came to Jesus and invited him to dinner. Jesus went in and sat down to table. The Orthodox man noticed that Jesus did not wash before the meal and was surprised. Jesus said to him: You Orthodox people wash everything outside, but is everything clean within you? Be kind to all men, and everything will be clean. And while he was in the house of the Orthodox man, a woman of the town, who was a wrong-doer came there. She had learnt that Jesus was in that house and came there and brought a bottle of perfume. And she knelt at his feet and wept, and wetting his feet with her tears wiped them with her hair, and poured the perfume over them. The Orthodox man saw this and thought to himself: He can hardly be a

Summary: 

The main idea of this text is that God is a spirit and cannot be measured or proven. The author believes that the Father, loving his son, has entrusted everything to him, including life. This belief is supported by the fact that believers have life through the Son, who is the only way to God. The text emphasizes the importance of faith in believing in the Son and receiving life through him.



Summarizing: prophet. If he were really a prophet he would know what sort of a woman it is that is washing his feet: he would know that she is a wrong-doer and would not let her touch him. Jesus, guessing his thought, turned to him and said: Shall I tell you what I think? Yes, do so, replied his host. Then Jesus said: There were two men who held themselves debtors to one master, one for five hundred pieces of money and the other for fifty. And neither of them had anything to pay with. And the creditor forgave them both. Which of them do you think would love the creditor and care for him most? The host replied: He of course that owed most. Then Jesus pointed to the woman and said: So it is with you and this woman. You consider yourself Orthodox, and therefore a small debtor; she considers herself wrong-doer and therefore a great debtor. I came into your house and you did not give me water to wash my feet; she washes them with her tears and wipes them with her hair. You did not kiss me, but she kisses my feet. You gave me no oil for my head, but she anoints my feet with precious perfume. He who considers himself Orthodox will not do works of love; only he who considers himself a wrong-doer will do them. And for works of love everything is forgiven. And he said to her: Your wickedness is forgiven

Summary: 

The given text is a paraphrase of a section from the Gospel of John, which describes the moment when Jesus washes the feet of his disciples. The original text reads: "Jesus said to them: 'If I, then, the one who cleanses you, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them. For I tell you that my Father will love



Summarizing: you. And Jesus said: Everything depends on what a man considers himself to be. He who considers himself good will not be good, but he who considers himself bad is good. And he added: Two men came into the Temple to pray. One was Orthodox, and the other was a tax-farmer. The Orthodox man prayed: I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men, not miserly, nor a libertine, nor a deceiver, nor such a wretch as that tax-farmer. I fast twice a week, and give away a tenth of my property. But the tax-farmer stood far away, and dared not look up to heaven but only beat his breast, saying: God, look upon me, sinner that I am. This was a better prayer than that of the Orthodox man, for he who exalts himself abases himself, and he who humbles himself raises himself. Then some pupils of John came to Jesus and said: Why do your pupils not fast, while we and the Orthodox fast a great deal? The law of God orders fasting. And Jesus said to them: While the bridegroom is at the wedding no one grieves. Only when the bridegroom has gone do they grieve. Having life, one should not grieve. The external service of God cannot be combined with the activity of love. The old teaching of external service of God cannot be combined with my teaching of active love of one's

Summary: 

 The external service of God cannot be combined with the activity of love, according to Jesus, as he says: Everything depends on what a man considers himself to be. This means that the two cannot be combined, as love is not a function of the external service of God. This is a clear statement from Jesus, who emphasizes the importance of separating the two concepts.



Summarizing: neighbour. To unite my teaching with the old is like tearing a piece from a new garment and sewing it onto an old one. The new one will be torn and the old one will not be mended. Either all my teaching must be accepted or all the old, and having accepted my teaching it is impossible to keep the old teaching of purification, fasting, and keeping Saturday—just as new wine must not be poured into old wine-skins, or the old skins will burst and the wine will be spilt. New wine must be put into new wine-skins and then they will both be preserved. THE SOURCE OF LIFE The life of all men proceeds from the spirit of the Father. 'hallowed be thy name' LATER on, some of John's pupils came to ask Jesus whether it was he of whom John spoke: Did he reveal the Kingdom of God and renew men by the spirit? Jesus answered and said: Look for yourselves, and listen to the teaching—and tell John whether the Kingdom of God has begun and whether people are being renewed by the spirit. Tell him what Kingdom of God I am preaching. It is said in the prophecies that when the Kingdom of God comes all men will be blessed. Tell him that my Kingdom of God is such that the poor are blessed, and so is everyone who understands the teaching. And having let John's pupils go, Jesus began to speak to the people about the Kingdom of God that John announced.

Summary: 

 The given text is a quote from the book "The Art of Teaching" by Rudolf Steiner, which is a collection of essays and lectures on education and spirituality. The quote is about the process of unifying teaching with the new, which involves putting new wine into old wine-skins and then preserving it. The quote emphasizes the importance of integrating new ideas and practices into existing ones, rather than trying to replace or eliminate them. It suggests that by combining old and new, we can create a more cohesive and effective teaching approach.



Summarizing: He said: When you went to John in the wilderness to be baptized, what did you go to see? Orthodox teachers of the law went to see John too, but they did not understand what he was talking about, and considered him of no account. Those Orthodox teachers of the law only consider true what they themselves invent and hear from one another, or the law they have themselves devised; but what John says and what I say, they do not listen to and do not understand. Of what John says they have only understood that he fasts in the wilderness, and they say: 'There is a devil in him.' Of what I say they have understood only that I do not fast, and they say: 'He eats and drinks with tax- gatherers and sinners—he is a friend of theirs.' They are like children in the street who chatter to one another and wonder that no one listens to them. And you may judge of their wisdom by what they do. If you went to John to see a man dressed in rich clothes—why, such men live here in the palaces. What then is it you went to see in the wilderness? Did you go because you think John is like other prophets? Do not think so! John is not a prophet like the others. He is more than all the prophets. The others foretold what might happen. He announces what is: namely, that the Kingdom of God was, and is, here on

Summary: 

The text is a quote from the Gospel of John, where Jesus tells the story of John the Baptist's baptism. In this context, the phrase "when you went to John in the wilderness to be baptized" refers to the journey that Jesus and his disciples took to John's baptismal site, where they were instructed to be baptized in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The phrase "what did you go to see?" refers to the purpose of the journey, which was to be baptized in the name of Jesus. The quote



Summarizing: earth. I tell you truly: no one greater than John has ever been born. He has declared the Kingdom of God on earth and is therefore above all the others. The law and the prophets were necessary till John came, but now he has announced that the Kingdom of God is on earth, and that he who makes an effort can enter into it. And some of the Orthodox came to Jesus and asked him: How and when will the Kingdom of God come? And he answered them: The Kingdom of God which I preach is not what the former prophets preached. They said that God would come with divers visible signs, but I speak of a Kingdom of God the coming of which cannot be seen with the eyes. And if anyone tells you: See, it has come, or is coming; or, See, it is here, or there; do not believe them. The Kingdom of God is not in any definite time or place. It is like lightning—here, there and everywhere. And it has neither time nor place, for the Kingdom of God that I preach is within you. After that, one of the Orthodox, a Jewish ruler named Nicodemus, came to Jesus at night and said: You do not bid men keep Saturday, or tell them to observe cleanliness, or to offer sacrifices, or to fast, and you would abolish the temple, and say that God is a spirit and that the Kingdom of God is within us. What is this Kingdom of God?

Summary: 

The law and the prophets were necessary until John came, but now John has announced that the Kingdom of God is on earth. This is a significant shift in the religious and political landscape of the region, and it is noteworthy that John does not believe in the existence of the law or the prophets. This suggests that John's message is not based on the authority of the Old Testament, but rather on the teachings of Jesus and the early Christian community. This shift in the religious and political landscape is significant because it challenges the traditional view of the relationship between the law and the prophets, and suggests that the Kingdom of God is not limited to a specific time or place.



Summarizing: And Jesus answered him: Understand that if man is conceived from heaven there must be something heavenly in him. You must be born again. Nicodemus did not understand this, and said: How can a man, born of the flesh and grown up, return to his mother's womb and be conceived afresh? And Jesus answered him: Understand what I say: I say that man is born not from the flesh alone but also from the spirit, and so every man is conceived of flesh and of spirit, and therefore the kingdom of heaven is within him. Of the flesh he is flesh, From flesh spirit cannot be born; spirit can come only from spirit. The spirit is the living thing within you which lives in freedom and reason; it is that of which you know neither the beginning nor the end and which every man feels within him. So why do you wonder that I said that we must be born from heaven? Nicodemus said: Still I do not believe that this can be so. Then Jesus said to him: What kind of a teacher are you if you do not understand this? Understand that I am not talking any kind of mystery; I speak of what we all know, and assure you of what we all see. How will you believe in what is in heaven if you do not believe in what is on earth and within

Summarizing: yourself? No one has ever gone up to heaven, and we have only man on earth who has come from heaven and is himself of heaven. It is this heavenly son of man that must be exalted, that all may believe in him and not perish but have heavenly life. Not for man's destruction, but for their good, did God implant in man this son of his, like unto Himself. He gave him that everyone should believe in him and not perish but have eternal life. He did not bring this son of his (this inner life) into the world of men to destroy it, but brought forth his son (this inner life) that the world of men should live by him. He who commits his life to this son of man does not die, but he who does not commit his life to him destroys himself by not trusting to what is life itself. Division (death) consists in this, that life came into the world, but men go away from that life. Light is the life of men; light came into the world, but men prefer darkness to light, and do not go to the light. He who does wrong avoids the light that his deeds may not be seen, and so deprives himself of life. But he who lives in the truth goes to the light that his deeds may be seen, and he has life and is united to

Summary: 

The main idea of this text is that God created man in his image and placed him on earth for his good. This idea is conveyed through the phrase "not for man's destruction," which implies that God's plan for man is not to harm or destroy him. The phrase "and his son" emphasizes that God's plan for man includes his son, Jesus Christ, who was born of a virgin and died on the cross for the sins of mankind. The phrase "of heaven" suggests that Jesus is a part of God's plan for heaven, where he will one day return to judge the world. Overall, the main idea of this text is that God's plan for man is not to harm



Summarizing: God. The Kingdom of God must be understood not as you imagine—that the Kingdom of God will come for all men at a certain time and in a certain place—but thus: in the whole world there are always some people who rely on the heavenly son of man, and these become sons of the Kingdom; the others who do not rely on him perish. The Father of the spirit in man is the Father of those only who acknowledge themselves as his sons. And therefore only those exist to him who have preserved within them what he gave them. After this Jesus began to explain to the people what the Kingdom of God is, and he taught it them by parables. He said: The Father—who is the spirit—sows the life of understanding in the world as a husbandman sows grain in his field. He sows over the whole field without remarking which seeds fall in what place. And some seeds fall on the path and the birds come and eat it. Other seeds fall among stones and though they come up they wither, because there is no room for their roots. Others again fall among wormwood and the wormwood chokes them, and though ears form they do not fill. But other seeds fall on good ground and grow and make up for the lost seed, and bear ears which fill, and which yield thirtyfold, or sixtyfold, or a

Summary: 

The main idea of the text is that the Kingdom of God will come for all men at a certain time and in a certain place, and that only those who acknowledge themselves as sons of the Father of spirits in man can be considered as having preserved what he gave them. The text also emphasizes the importance of recognizing oneself as a son of the Father of spirits in man and preserving what he has given.



Summarizing: hundredfold. So God also has sown the spirit broadcast in man: in some it is lost but in others it yields a hundredfold. It is these last that form the Kingdom of God. So the Kingdom of God is not what you imagine—that God will come to reign over you. God has sown the spirit, and the Kingdom of God will be only in those who preserve it. God does not force men but, like a sower, casts seed on the ground and thinks no more of it. The seed itself swells, sprouts, puts forth leaf, stalk, and ears that fill with grain. Only when it has ripened does the husbandman send reapers to gather in the harvest. In the same way God gave His Son—the spirit—to the world; and the spirit grows in the world of itself, and the sons of the spirit make up the Kingdom of God. A woman puts yeast into a kneading trough and mixes it with flour. She then mixes it no more but lets the yeast and the bread rise. As long as people live God does not interfere with their life. He gave the spirit to the world and the spirit lives in men, and those who live by the spirit constitute the Kingdom of God. For the spirit there is neither death nor evil. Death and evil exist for the flesh but not for the spirit. The Kingdom of God may be compared to this: a farmer sowed good seed in his

Summary: 

 The main idea of this text is that God has created a spirit that is immortal and free from death and evil. This spirit is not limited by the physical body, and it can exist independently of the flesh. This idea is central to the Christian belief in the resurrection of the body and the eternal life that follows. The text emphasizes the importance of preserving this spirit, which is the source of life and salvation, and emphasizes the need to avoid the physical and worldly temptations that can lead to death and evil.



Summarizing: field. The farmer is the spirit, the Father; the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the Kingdom of God. Then the farmer lay down to sleep and an enemy came and sowed darnel in the field. The enemy is temptation, and the darnel represents those who yield to temptation. Then the laborers came to the farmer and said: Can you have sown bad seed? Much darnel has come up on your field. Send us to weed it out. And the farmer said: No, do not do that, or in weeding out the darnel you will trample the wheat. Let them grow together. When the harvest comes I will tell the reapers to gather the darnel and burn it, but the wheat I will store in the barn. The harvest is the end of human life, the harvesters are the powers of heaven. They will burn the darnel, but the wheat will be winnowed and gathered. So also at life's end all that was temporary illusion will perish, and the true life of the spirit will alone be left. Evil does not exist for the Father, the spirit. The spirit keeps what it needs and what is not of it does not exist for it. The kingdom of heaven is like a net. When spread out in the sea it catches all kinds of fish, and when it is drawn in, the worthless fish are set aside and thrown back into the
