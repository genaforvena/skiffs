Molloy is living in her mother's room and doesn't know how she got there.
There is a man who gives her money every week and takes away the pages.
The man is a queer one who comes for the fresh pages every Sunday and brings back the previous week's pages, which are marked with signs that Molloy doesn't understand.
Molly doesn't work for this strange man but she knows he likes her. She also knows they're going to be arrested soon.
It's hard to get away. The police are on her trail. It's easier to stay where she is. It is, after all, home.
"Home," Molloy thinks.
Molloy (Sara R. Smith)
The "Home" play by Sara R. Smith follows a young woman who has been raped and abandoned by her

The character has a premonition of the end of the world and suggests that it's in the head.
The character sees two men, A and C, walking towards each other on a bare, undulating road in a country with no hedges or ditches.
A and C are separated by a wide space and undulating land due to undulating terrain.
They meet in the same trough-shaped valley between them (the character's dream is a valley with an arched entrance)
As the two men approach each other, they come closer and closer until they touch. The air becomes heavy, and the ground rumbles as if there are earthquakes beneath them. Then A and C separate once again, walking away from each other in opposite directions (the character's dream is a straight road).
In most of the scenes, the characters' faces and bodies are barely

Samuel Beckett and two wayfaring strangers encountered each other on a deserted road on an evening in a deserted part of the country.
They did not pass each other by but stopped, face-to-face, and exchanged a few words before each went on his way back towards the town.
SAMUEL BECKETT knows the treacherous hills where they encounter each other, having walked them several times. He has also been there with strangers. But he is not at ease here because this is a new experience for him. It was a week ago that he and two companions were walking along the road and had met a strange-looking man.
This stranger offered to drive them into town in his car, but they declined as it was getting late and they were tired of travelling by foot. They went their separate ways on that evening.
"A few

I was perched higher than the road’s highest point and flattened against a rock the same colour as myself, grey.
I watched him recede, overtaken by an anxiety which was not necessarily his own.
The man I flattened against was wearing a cocked hat and I remember being struck by it, but not by a cap or a bowler as I wouldn't have been hit in my head for three miles before he passed me.
I’d never seen him like this. It wasn't just the colour of his skin either; there was something about how he held himself that was different from most.
He stood tall, confident and with a look of intent on his face as he spoke to the policeman standing beside him.
It was the first time I’d seen a black man in full-on control of his emotions.
I

Samuel Beckett is a character who is bare-headed, wears sand-shoes, and smokes a cigar.
SAMUEL BECKETT has just left a town and is on his way to return to it.
A pomeranian dog, identified as an orange Pomeranian, is following Samuel Beckett.
SamuEL Beckett was carrying an orange fleece and smoking a cigar. He had been in the town for two hours when he took off, saying that he wanted to return there by noon.
The town of Beckett has one major attraction: a giant statue of Samuel Beckett. This statue is made of white marble and stands at about 10 feet tall.
There was once a time when people believed that the brain was an organ that controlled all the functions of the body. Today, we know that this is not true; however

The character has a crutches and is hobbling along a road looking for a man with a stick.
The man with the stick hears the character's cries and waits for her.
He is kind and kind to her, telling her about the dog, the ^nan, what he smokes, inspects the shoes, and other things.
She believes him and believes it's her only chance of getting over the mountain.
At least she hopes so. It seems like a reasonable thing for a man with a stick and a crutches to do. The character doesn't seem at all stupid, just confused. She is looking for someone who can get her across the road, not talk about dogs or smoking.
She keeps asking him questions:
"Where am I?"
"Where are you going?"
"How can I cross this road?"
The

The character has lost her hat and crutches.
The hat is an old-fashioned town hat, fastened to the buttonhole of a buttonhole, always the same buttonhole in the same season, always fastened by a long lace, always attached to the chin by a string or clastic, and always worn under the chin.
She has a greatcoat that has a flower on it and is a different color for every day of the year except for Wednesdays which she wears her red coat on when it's winter. She also has an umbrella that will keep her from getting wet in the rain and snow, but it doesn't work at all.
The crutches are two wooden sticks with little metal spikes on the bottom to help her get around, and a leather strap that goes across her arms. She holds them close so she can walk

I have experienced various types of sleep, including during the daytime and in the morning.
In my life, I have woken between eleven o'clock and midday and decided to go and see my mother for an urgent nature.
I found my bicycle on the road where I had left it, which enabled me to get back to the town.
There was no moon in my night, and I slept for about four hours until the morning sun arose.
It has been said that people sleep more during the daytime because they don't have a light at night.
I think that's not true. I would rather sleep less if it were possible. The reason why we sleep is to rest our mind after working hard. But if we are lazy, then our body will also be lazy and we won't want

My mother brought me into the world through a hole in her arse.
I used to ride a green chainless bicycle with a free-wheel, which was green and had a red horn instead of the bell fashionable in the olden days.
The bicycle was a pleasure to ride and to blow the horn, which I remember as a pleasure and almost a pleasure.
When I had to part from my bike, it hurt very much. The first time, after ten years, it was when I moved into my own flat at 18; but later, when I got married, I gave up the bicycle.
Now I ride in buses which are mostly blue (I don’t know why they aren’t all green).
The bus has a horn and an engine, and is far from being as pleasant to ride as my old bicycle with its free wheel.

Samuel BBCKETT and the character, Dan, are old, like two old cronies with the same memories, the same rancours, and the same expectations.
Samuel remembers saving a swallow and saving a ring.
Dan's real name is not Dan, but his real father's name is Dan.
Mag, the character's nickname, is a letter-less syllable that abolishes all vowels in her name. She is also known as "P" because she wears glasses. Her parents are married to a man who works at the Royal Mint, and Mag has been working there since she was thirteen.
Dan and Sam have never seen each other. They've only had phone calls, text messages and letters written by their mothers about them.
The novel begins when Samuel is twenty-seven, and Dan is thirty. There's a problem; Samuel

The character has lost the ability to count beyond two steps and has lost her ability to remember past two steps beyond the first two.
The character manipulates money into her mind by knocking on her skull with her index knuckle, replac- ing the four knocks of her fist according to her needs.
Mag visited the character each week for her mother's money.
Despite her struggles, the character is very good at math and loves to do calculations. She also has a strong understanding of numbers and is able to use them in various ways.
The character can count to three but will only remember the first two numbers. However, she is still capable of counting up to five using different methods such as clapping or tapping her fingers on her forehead.
She struggles with math problems that require more than one step and often gets confused when trying to solve them. For example

Samuel BecketT is a character who has a strong preference for Araby and enjoys the smell of Araby's perfumes.
Samuel has a sense of shame and shame and seeks refuge from the world, often seeking refuge in a dark, dark room.
After a night of heavy drinking, Samuel feels weakened and weakened by the sun, which he believes has poisoned him due to the rising heat.
The character is a member of the "doom cult," a group that worships the gods of Araby and seeks to bring the world to ruin through the use of dark magic.
Samuel Beckett's books are filled with characters who have a strong preference for Araby, a fictional place in the Middle East that is known for its rich history and culture. In his novels "The End," "No Time Like The Past," and "Atonement

I am disabled and rely on crutches to walk due to illness.
There are two laws, one for the healthy and another for the sick.
I carry only bits of newspaper to wipe myself when I have a stool.
The weather was fine and we walked along quiet, sunlit side streets with him pushing my bicydle with the tips of his white-gloved fingers.
At least they were more willing than many others in their own culture to accept me as someone who is disabled or sick or physically or mentally different.
I am a young woman with two children and a full-time job, but I have to take time off because of my illness.
The doctors said I had an "autoimmune disorder" that was causing inflammation in many places in my body.
She is often the only person in her

Samuel BBCKETT was dismissed by a sergeant who dismissed him after listening to his subordinate’s report.
Samuel is from a shambles district where his mother lived and has been living for a long time.
He is not accustomed to being questioned and is afraid of it.
Despite his fear, Samuel is used to blows and insults and can cope with insults and abuse.
His family has always had him in their midst and they are comfortable with the idea that he will be around them when needed.
Samuel is very close to the police department in which he works.
He was a member of the first team that went on duty in the area and has since served as the chief constable, deputy chief officer and assistant chief constranger.
The officers are a mixture of white and black people who have worked together for years.

Molloy has a short, stiff leg and uses two postures, the vertical and horizontal.
She remembers her name and her mother's name is also Molloy.
A woman dressed in black and mauve and holding a mug of green tea with saccharine and powdered milk, a thick slab of dry bread, and a glass of cold lemonade served to Mollys' family by their housekeeper. The tea was laced with strychnine; the bread had arsenic and the lemonade had cyanide.
The woman said she'd be back in about an hour and left. In the meantime, Mollys mother took her daughter upstairs into the nursery, closed the door and began to choke on her food.
Mollys mother died.
This was the beginning of a series of murders at the house.
I first met

The social worker who gave me a mug containing a hard, liquid and soft, sodden bread in which the hard, the liquid and the soft were joined, transferred it to me without my consent or understanding how it was done.
I was shocked and distressed by the transfer and found myself in a situation where social workers offer free, gratis and for nothing something to prevent swooning, a state of collapse brought on by excessive anxiety, sadness and hopelessness. I have been taught that anxiety, sadness and hopelessness are not emotions which should be encouraged but rather discouraged.
There is no doubt that the transfer was an excellent way to cope with my anxiety, sadness and despair. I felt overwhelmed in my distress and found myself unable to take action on what had happened to me because of my state of being. The soft bread was a way to give me permission to

I used to be intelligent, quick, intelligent, and well-behaved.
My last execution was due to being corrected by superiors who did not teach me the principles of good manners.
In the past, I used to have the capacity for good-behaving but was corrected only on points of detail and did not receive guidance from the system.
Before his execution, I had only negative and destructive thoughts about myself.
I still cannot accept that all of these were me when I was a child.
Since my birth, I am now the "child" who does not deserve to live.
This is not good for me and it does not bring benefits to society.
Before my execution, I have had little pleasure in living because I feel that I cannot make contributions as an adult.
I want to be a better person so that I can become an asset

A pebble in a person's mouth appeases, soothes, and makes them forget hunger and thirst.
A man was angered by the slow movement of a person who had a sick leg and passed it over the frame of the frame.
The person's leg was smooth from having been sucked by the pebbles, having been beaten by the storm, and was stiff from being sucked for long time.
This is how the pebble in the mouth works!
Pebble in the Mouth: The Benefits Of Having It In Your Mouth For A Few Minutes Every Day?
The body's most natural way to relax and remove tension is to chew pebbles. This helps to relieve stress, anxiety, anger, and even physical pain.
When you are stressed or anxious, it is difficult to feel safe and calm. Chewing a peb

Samuel BecketT believes he knew them and must have known them, and needs to find them again to understand why they are dead.
Samuel suggests that he would have to go to his mother, who thinks she is alive, to find out why.
All the famous flies are dead, including Molloy in a ditch.
Molloy is sinking deeper and deeper under the water; Samuel Beckett says he will never see him again.
They were all dead when they went into that room.
I think I know where I am and what you have seen, but I don't know how to get out of here without killing myself, or if there's even a way out.
The only thing we can say is that they are not dead yet; maybe they're going to get up in the morning, just like you and me.


A shepherd and a dog were watching me from above, with the dog less closely and the shepherd more closely.
The shepherd was panting and his dog was gnawing at his flesh to gnaw at ticks.
I initially mistook the dog for a black sheep entangled in the brambles and thought the dog was waiting for an order from his master to drag me out.
A few months ago, I learned about the concept of "toxic shame". This idea is the result of some very interesting research, including studies done by Dr. Brené Brown on shame.
Dr. Brown has defined toxic shame as a state when you have a negative belief that you are not enough and to be in this state, it requires two conditions: you must believe you're inherently flawed, and your world is harsh and unforgiving, so the only way for you to

Samuel Beckett's second day began with doubts about the destination of a group of sheep, lambs, and quadrupeds.
The sheep were slaughtered with a pole-axe, their skulls shattered, their thin legs crumpling, and their legs crushed under the pole.
Despite his distaste for farts, Samuel Beckett counted over three hundred and fifteen farts in nine-and-a-half minutes while performing at the Edinburgh Fringe festival.
The sheep were slaughtered with a pole-axe, their skulls shattered, their thin legs crumpling, and their legs crushed under the pole. And then there were farts — Beckett's fourth act.
Beckett, a playwright who died in 1989, began his second day of performing at the Edinburgh Fringe festival on Saturday morning with doubts about the destination of a group of sheep,

I was born in a part of the world where the mornings are sunny until about 10 or 11 am and the skies darken and rain falls until evening.
I was on my way to my mother when I made a wrong turn and found myself in a district I did not know.
There was only one road that led to my town and I was unsure if it was the right one.
However, I decided to go ahead with my journey on this unknown path because I had no other choice.
As I walked through the unfamiliar streets, I couldn't help but notice how different everything looked compared to what I knew. The houses were made of mud instead of bricks and the people wore colorful clothes instead of formal attire.
I was amazed by the vibrant atmosphere surrounding me and decided to explore further. As I continued my journey, I stumbled upon a small village where children

SAMUEL BECKETT considers the words "know" and "the dead things" to be a handsome little sum.
Samuel Beckett once made a resolution to stop by the kerb and ask a passer-by for the name of a town and then whip off his hat to ask for it.
This resolution was thwarted when his bicycle ran over a dog and the dog fell to the ground, dead.
The scene from "Waiting For Godot" is now etched in Beckett's mind and he has been pondering on the meaning of death ever since.
But before the author of Waiting for Godot got the idea of writing this play, there was a great deal about death that he knew. He had an intimate knowledge of his own mortality which he was not afraid to show.
Beckett had never been married and although his first wife

Teddy, who I loved like my own child, was killed by a man named Samuel Beckett.
Teddy was blind, deaf, blind, crippled with rheumatism, and perpetually incontinent.
I was planning to take Teddy to the veterinary surgeon to have him put out of his misery.
The man who killed Teddy was an old, disabled, blind pensioner who had a large dog called Max that he kept chained outside his house.
Teddy’s owner said that the dog was very aggressive towards her and she was afraid of him. She asked me to shoot the dog if I thought it would be kinder for Teddy.
I replied that it was not my place as an animal rights activist to judge what is right or wrong, but that Max could easily kill Teddy with one bite so he should probably be shot.
The

Sophie has told me that she does not need anyone else.
I have a strong desire to communicate with my mother, which drives me into a frenzy.
This desire for communication drives me to avoid speaking too much or too little due to the fear of speaking too little.
It has happened to me before where I thought I had said too much and too little, but it turned out that everyone in the group felt the same way about myself.
So I don't want you to talk too much or too little with your mother, because you'll feel bad if they do.
If you don't need anyone else, then why are you listening? Because you like being close to someone.
You can say that you don't know how to listen, and it's true. But if you're not familiar with the concept of listening, perhaps this will help

Lousse lived in a house where she had a dog named Loussc.
Lousse's dog was buried under a tree and Lousse was responsible for digging the hole because she couldn't because of her weak leg.
Despite being one-legged, she was able to see to the dog's burial.
Samuel Beckett, a watchmaker, helped Lousse bury the dog.
Lousse had no other people in the house at the time and there were no neighbors in the area.
Because of that, Loussc didn't have any companionship or food.
She had been without any for an unknown amount of time before she was found.
After the burial, Lousse decided to look for a job on the streets, because she wanted some money and so she could buy some meat.
The dog's grave contained a piece of chicken.

The dog was buried without any box or wrapping, just with his collar and lead attached.
The dog's grave was under a larch tree.
I was a spectator to the burial and contributed my presence as a mere spectator.
She gave me food, drink, and a chair to sit in due to her discomfort due to a stiff leg.
After the burial, the dog's spade went back into his collar, which was attached to his lead.

Lousse has a parrot named Pretty Polly.
Pretty Polly has a history of expressing anger and frustration.
Lousse tried to make Pretty Polly say something, but Pretty Polly said "Putain de merde".
Louse understands Pretty Polly better than his mistress.
According to Lousse, Pretty Polly was owned by an American sailor before he was bought by a French sailor.
If Lousse had not been on the ship, the story would have ended differently because he would not have found out about Pretty Polly's past.
This is a very old story and some people doubt it is true.
According to Louse, this is how pretty Polly learned to say "Putain de merde".
Lousse had a parrot named Pretty Polly. He was a smart bird that could talk like a human. But one day, Pretty Polly got angry at Lousse's

I woke up in a cjjair and thought I was about to be sacrificed at sunrise.
My mother was far away from me, but I was closer to her the previous night.
If I had been in the right town, my mother would have been absent.
There was a large moon in the room, moving from left to right or both together.
The room was divided into three segments with an arch separating them. The center segment was lit by a large light shining from above and the two other segments were covered by dark curtains. I could see only the small space between the upper curtain and my back wall in one of the dimly lit rooms, but there were many similar places where I could not see at all or just a faint outline of something that I could barely discern.
I knew that my mother was far away from me, so I looked for her

The place described is described as a place devoid of mystery, deserted by magic, devoid of magic, and devoid of any mystery.
The place has a mysterious voice that speaks of a world collapsing and a frozen world, a world where all wilts and yields and the ground is unfit for loads.
In the place described, there is no light and there are no loads, and the light seems to be in the form of an infinite number of stars.
The place has a beautiful and mysterious voice that speaks of a land where you can walk out into the mountains without fear and have endless forests filled with trees that grow as tall as a tree, and when you return home from your adventures, it will be as if you never left the forest.
In the described place there is no light in which the darkness seems to be a beautiful and mysterious voice that speaks of a

The moon which sailed gallant and full past my window the previous night was possibly young and slender, possibly with a young, slender woman on her back.
This moon had been waiting for the new moon before launching off on unknown ways, leading south.
The moon seen from Lousse's house was not new and was in the first quarter of its first quarter.
There were 14 full days between this new moon and the next, and it wasn't unusual to see a new moon every 10 or 12 nights during the middle of these full moons.
This month, I am going to try to find out where the moon went when it disappeared on January 5th (I'm not sure if that day is also one of those 14-day intervals).
I'll also attempt to figure out which way the moon will go next and what the new moon in this lunar month will

The night was moonless and the moon was foreign to me, transporting me back to other nights and other moons.
I had forgotten who I was and spoken of myself as I would have spoken of another person if I had been compelled to do so.
It sometimes happens for me to forget who I am and strut before my eyes, like a stranger.
The sky and the earth take on false colours.
The night has become something else to me; it is now an unending darkness.
I have no idea about where I am but this is not a problem because I do not care as long as I am not alone in the dark.
How can you tell if someone is going crazy? It's like asking, how do you know if a horse has gone mad? You don't. Or perhaps you can, at least when it comes to their behaviour and reactions

The character has a stiff leg and is unable to do much due to injury.
Despite her physical limitations, the character has the ability to restore objects to their proper places and make minor improvements.
The character possesses a pink and transparent nightdress with ribands and frills, adorned with ribbons and lape, and a yellow waistcoat with brass buttons and sandals, but she has lost her shoes during an attack by the demon Gomorrah.
The character is able to perform tasks that require movement. The character's movements are restricted due to injury. Despite this restriction, the character is able to restore objects and make minor improvements.
In addition to her physical limitations, the character also lacks certain items. She has a pink and transparent nightdress with ribands and frills, adorned with ribbons and lape, as well as a yellow waistcoat with

MOLLOY was looking for an old lace to fasten her hat to her buttonhole.
The lace was missing but MOLLOY did not mention it to the valet.
Her sucking-stone was no longer there, but she decided not to mention it.
Some of her belongings were missing, including a knife found in the pockets of her clothes.
This knife turned out to be a weapon for robbery and murder.
MOLLOY had left her purse in the car. She later noticed that someone had taken the money from the purse but did not tell anyone.
When she went back into the car to get her purse, she was robbed again, this time of her jewellery and her wallet.
She finally told her mother that her handbag had been stolen but there was nothing that could be done about it.
MOLLOY never returned to the

Lousse was in the garden, sowing grass on a grave and taking advantage of the cool evening.
Lousse gave food and drink to me while I was looking for my bicycle.
I found the bicycle half buried in a soft bush and threw aside my crutches, intending to wheel it a little before getting on and leaving.
It was dusk and it was dusk when I went to look for my bicycle in the garden. The garden is next to the back door of the house and so we usually have to go through there to get into the street, but sometimes the path goes to the front gate and then to the road at the end of a driveway, so that's what I did this evening.
Lousse came out with some food and drink, poured me a glass of water and took a piece of cake from a basket. I'd left my

The bicycle I was riding had broken down and I was unable to turn the wheels.
Lousse, a character named Lousse, took advantage of my weakness and made propositions to lure me into living in her home.
She poisoned my beer with something intended to mollify me and Molloy.
I agreed to live in Lousse's home as though it were my own and would help her feed the birds in her garden.
At first I was reluctant, but my friends convinced me that she was harmless and would be a good influence on me.
After spending some time with Lousse and observing how she cared for her pet birds, I became interested in bird-raising as well.
Eventually I began to trust Lousse and felt comfortable living with her.
As the days went by, Molloy grew concerned about my relationship with Lousse and tried

She gathered lavender and made lavender-bags that she put in her cupboards to perfume her handkerchiefs, underclothing, and house-linen.
She spent a lot of time with me, spending her time squatting or kneeling beside me while I was stretched out on the grass.
I heard the chiming of the hours from the clocks and belfries from time to time.
He was not much of a gardener but he had some sense in his garden as the herbs he grew were used for the making of ointments, salves, liniments, poultices and tonics.
They would gather their food and drink at the well or they could visit one of the many inns that dotted the roadsides.
She was not a very good gardener but she did have an herb garden in the back yard.


Samuel Beckett has a sensitive ear and perceives the world in a formal and formalistic manner.
Despite his sensitive ear, Samuel has trouble understanding what others say to him and what he says to them.
Samuel has a dream where he picks up his marble, which is threadbare and a bit threadbare.
In the dream, Samuel Beckett hears and hears the words "be careful" repeatedly in the background but can't understand them for any reason. He is very concerned about this and decides that if he continues to hear these words in his dreams, there must be something wrong with him.
He finally goes to a doctor who tells him that he's fine.
Samuel Beckett has been going through a difficult period in his life.
Samuel Beckett has not been able to sleep well for the last few months

I was born with only one functioning eye and only one eye.
I often misjudged the distance separating me from the other world and often mis-judged it.
My attempts at taste and smell were less fortunate, as I could not distinguish between good and bad smells.
The house and garden were fixed due to some unknown mechanism of com- pensation and when I moved, from time to time, the sense of direction was lost.
I had a weak memory, poor concentration, poor coordination, no balance, no depth perception. I suffered from a few minor diseases such as cold, cough, etc.
After years of treatment, my eyes were restored to their normal functioning. My sense of taste and smell improved after some time. The house and garden were not fixed but they have been maintained.
My memory and concentration are better now. I am

Samuel Beckett spends his time in a house and a garden where he has no knowledge of the work being done and is unaware of what is going on in the house or the garden.
He prefers the garden due to the long hours he spends there.
The garden is surrounded by a high wall with a wicket-gate that he has opened and closed without trouble and has seen it used by various people, including children who had broken into his garden when they were playing in the nearby park.
There are many doors leading into the house.
Samuel Beckett does not have any of his own furniture.
He spends most of his time sitting on a stool or chair that he uses to sit down and relax.
The stool and chair are placed next to a window where they can be used as seating for anyone who wishes to sit there.
This is

Lousse is a character who rarely showed herself to Samuel Beckett.
Samuel believes that Lousse spied on him, possibly by hiding behind bushes, hiding behind the bushes, skulking in the shadows of a first-floor room, or using a spy-glass.
Lousse inspected Samuel's activities, observing him from his going to bed, his sleeping and getting up, and then reading about the world outside. Lousse was always watching.

Loussc injects stimulants into her various systems, including stimulants and depressants.
She has the ability to levitate, levitate in the air, and collapse like a puppet when her strings are dropped.
Despite her levitation abilities, Loussc has not been able to control her fall due to the effects of the stimulants she injects into her system.
Loussc's mother is unable to control the effect of the depressants, which causes the levitation to stop and cause Loussc to drop like a puppet when she stops levitating.
She has fallen many times, causing damage to her body and resulting in broken bones and bruises.
Lousc's falls have also caused her to become very dizzy, causing her to lose control of her limbs.
Louscs mother is unable control the effect that the stimul

Samuel BECKETT regrets that she chose the least evil option during her stay with Lousse.
Lousse was described as a woman of extraor-dimensional flatness, physically speaking, with a deep voice and a somewhat hairy face.
Samuel BecketT's health did not improve during her time in Lousse's care and she experienced no new symptoms, including those arising from the use of the treatment itself.
Her experience was reported to the National Health Service (NHS) where it was considered that her condition had worsened by her second stay with Lousse.
Samuel BecketT has suffered pain for six years, and since her first visit in November 2011 she has experienced no improvement and is unable to return home after her treatment as she lives in a care home.
Her health has continued to deteriorate with no improvements and there is a

There was a woman named Edith, possibly my grandmother, who made me acquainted with love.
Edith had a slit between her legs and a slit in her rectum.
I put my penis into Edith's rectum through this slit and toiled and moiled until I either gave up trying or was begged by her to stop.
Another woman named Ruth, also known as Edith, would have been at the age of 14 when she first came to live in our home with me. She had a cataract (and an eye hole) on the right side of her face, so I thought that we were going to be looking at one another's eyes throughout our lives.
It was the summer before my freshman year of high school and I remember having dinner with my mother every night for two or three days in a row. Then on Monday we

Samuel Beckett and Ruth had a sexual encounter in a rubbish dump.
Ruth gave money after each session to Samuel Beckett for her services.
Samuel was initially attracted to Ruth because she was an idealist and gave him a higher opinion of love than he would have liked.
The experience of the chambermaid was unique and perfect, achieved and inimitable.
After learning of Ruth's death, Samuel had sexual contact with a girl on the street.
Samuel Beckett and Ruth were both married but after they met in an Irish pub they became lovers.
Ruth did not want her husband to know about their relationship, so she kept it secret from him.
The two began spending time together in a small room at the end of the bar where they would have sex.
Samuel Beckett was also known as "P. L. O

Lousse is an old, withered, widowed, and widowed.

Lousse approaches the young old man with her dog in tow. "Hi there," she says warmly. "I'm so sorry about what happened earlier. Is there anything I can do to help you out?"
