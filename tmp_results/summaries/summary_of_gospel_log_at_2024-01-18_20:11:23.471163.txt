The Orthodox teachers of the law sent their assistants to contend with him, but these assistants returned to them and said: We can do nothing with him.And the chief priest said: How is it you have not convicted him?They replied: No one ever spoke as he does.Then the Orthodox said: It signifies nothing that you cannot refute him and that the people believe his teaching.We do not believe it and none of the rulers believe it.The people are accursed, they always were stupid and ignorant, and will believe anyone.But Nicodemus, to whom Jesus had explained his teaching, said to the chief priests: A man should not be condemned without being heard, and without understanding what he teaches.But they said to him: There is nothing to hear or to understand.We know that no prophet can come from Galilee.Another time Jesus spoke to the Orthodox and said: There can be no proof of the truth of my teaching, just as you cannot have an illumination of light.My teaching is the real light by which people see what is good and what is bad, and so it is impossible to prove my teaching; everything else is proved by it.He who follows me will not be in darkness but will have life.Life and enlightenment are one and the same.But the Orthodox said: It is only you who say this.And he replied: If I alone say it, still I am right, for I know whence I come and whither I go.In my teaching life has a meaning, but according to yours it has none.Besides, not I alone teach this, but my Father, the spirit, teaches it too.They said: Where is your Father?He replied: You do not understand my teaching or you would know my Father.You do not know whence you are nor whither you go.I show you the way, but instead of following me you discuss who I am; and so you cannot reach that salvation and life to which I wish to lead you.

And you will perish if you remain in this error and do not follow me.The Jews asked: Who are you?He said: I told you when I first began to teach: I am the son of man, acknowledging the spirit as my Father, and what I have understood from him I tell to the world.When you exalt the son of man in yourselves you will know what I am, because I do and speak not of myself as a man, but what the Father has taught me.He who sent me is always in me and will not leave me, for I do His will.He who keeps to my understanding of life and fulfils the will of the Father will be truly taught by me.To know the truth you must do good to men.He who does harm to men loves the darkness and goes towards it; he who does good to men goes to the light.So to understand my teaching you must do good.He who does good will know the truth; he will be free from evil, from death.For everyone who errs becomes the slave of his error.And as a slave does not always live in his master's house while the master's son does, so a man if he errs in life and becomes the slave of his errors does not live always, but dies.Only he who is in the truth remains always living.To know truth is to be a son and not a slave.If you err, you will be slaves and will die: but if you are in the truth you will be free sons and will live.You say of yourselves that you are sons of Abraham, and that you know the truth.Yet you wish to kill me because you do not understand my teaching.And it comes to this, that I speak what I have understood from my Father while you wish to do what you have understood from your father.They said: Our father is Abraham.Jesus said to them: If you were the sons of Abraham you would do his deeds.Summarization models summary:

But you wish to kill me because I have told you what I have learnt from God.Abraham did not act like that.You do not serve God, but serve another father.They said to him: We are not bastards, we are all sons of one Father, we are all God's children.And Jesus said to them: If your father were one with me you would love me, for I came forth from the Father; I was not born of myself.You are not children of one Father with me, so you do not understand my words and my understanding of life finds no place in you.If I am of the Father and you are of the same Father, then you cannot wish to kill me.If you wish to kill me, we are not of the same Father.I am from the Father of goodness, God: but you are from the father of evil, the devil.You wish to do the lusts of your father who always was a murderer and a liar with no truth in him.If he, the devil, says anything, he says not what is common to all, but what is his own, and he is the father of lies.So you are servants of the devil and are his children.You see how plainly you are convicted of error.If I err, convict me; but if there is no error in me why do you not believe me?And the Jews began to revile him and to say that he was possessed.He said: I am not possessed.I honour the Father, and you wish to kill me, which shows that you are not my brothers but sons of another father.It is not I who affirm that I am right, but the truth that speaks for me.And so I repeat to you: he who comprehends my teaching and performs it shall not see death.And the Jews said: Now, were we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a devil?You convict yourself!

The prophets died, so did Abraham, yet you say that he who fulfills your teaching shall not see death.Abraham died, and will you not die?Or are you greater than Abraham?The Jews discussed what he—Jesus of Galilee—was, whether he was an important or an unimportant prophet, and forgot that he had told them that he said nothing of himself as a man but spoke of the spirit that was within him.And Jesus said: I do not make myself out to be anything.If I spoke of myself, of what I imagine, then all I might say would be of no importance.But there is that source of all things which you call God.It is of that I speak.You have not known, and do not know, the true God.But I know Him and if I said I do not know Him I should be a liar like you.I know Him and know and fulfil His will.Your father Abraham saw and rejoiced at what I understand.The Jews said: You are not yet thirty: how could you be alive in Abraham's day?He replied: Before Abraham existed there was the understanding of good that I tell you of.Then the Jews picked up stones to throw at him, but he escaped.And on the road, Jesus saw a man who had no understanding from the time of his birth.And his pupils asked him: Who is at fault that this man is without understanding since his birth?He, or his parents for not having taught him?And Jesus replied: Neither his parents nor he are at fault.It is God's doing, that there may be light where there was darkness.If I have a teaching, it is the light of the world.And Jesus explained to the ignorant man that he was a son of God in the spirit, and on receiving this teaching the ignorant man was conscious of light.Those who had known him previously did not recognize him.Though resembling what he had been, he had now become another man.
