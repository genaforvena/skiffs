Stand still.
Stand still.
The last time I saw the twain.
Sudden change in the direction of the kneecap.
Diminished light cannot go in the void.
The last words of the night.
Let's try. Bad is worse than good.
The last is gone.
Diminutive eyes.
How long will it last?
The worst is still worse.
Worst is still worse.
Best way to start a new relationship.
A new look at the way things are done.
A new look at the world.
Preying still worse than never before.
Stare out there in the middle of nowhere.
A new look at the skull.
