This poem seems to convey a confusing scenario involving a missing body that ends up standing in an unknown location with an unknown light source. The character appears to be tired of their predicament and is sick of choosing between different situations or perspectives ('one or the other'). They seem to have a strong desire to avoid pain even if it means making difficult decisions or choices."Note: Interpretation of poetry often varies as it can be abstract by nature.

This mysterious narrative appears to describe an eerie setting characterized by absence of future prospects and dim lighting. In this environment, a seemingly transformed body has evolved from lying down to standing up.

A disabled individual is present in the story, who can move with difficulty due to their impaired hands. An old man and a young child are seen walking together through this void, with the old man extending his hand to grasp that of the child. Their journey seems to lead them from the void into an undefined realm where nothing exists conventionally.

In summary, we have a setting lacking future expectations with dim illumination, a transformed body standing up amidst it all, and two individuals walking through darkness towards another unknown place while holding hands.


This description paints a picture of two individuals navigating an uncertain environment together while facing backward. Their appearances are uniformly grey, suggesting a lack of distinction between them. The old man is in a kneeling position, which seems more fitting than standing for reasons unexplained but likely significant within the context of their story. Throughout this scene, both characters experience sudden changes in thoughts and actions that alter their feelings as they progress through the dark void. Their slow pace suggests an atmosphere of difficulty or obstacle, further underscoring the challenging nature of their journey.

This poem describes a surreal setting where everything appears dark and gloomy except for a faint light. The characters are dressed in white greatcoats with black boot heels and seem to move slowly ('plod'). Their hands also match their attires. There seems to be no solid ground or bones mentioned, indicating an absence of physicality within this void. It implies that the characters exist without pain or any sense of time as they 'forever kneel', suggesting a state of perpetual submission or reverence. However, it is important to note that the poem's structure and meaning may be difficult to understand due to its abstract nature and lack of clear contextualization.
