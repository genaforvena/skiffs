 Samuel Beckett is in his mother's room and sleeps in her bed . He doesn't know how he got there but says he was helped by a man who comes every week . He says: 'I don’t know how I got there. I was helped'
 "I piss and shit in her pot. I have taken her place. I must resemble her more and more. All I need now is a son. Perhaps I have one somewhere. But I think not. He would be old now, nearly as old as myself .
 All grows dim. A little more and you’ll go blind. It’s in the head. It doesn’t work any more, it says . You go dumb as well and sounds fade. The threshold scarcely crossed .
 It was on a road remarkably bare, I mean without hedges or ditches or any kind of edge . cows were chewing in enormous fields, lying and stand- ing in the evening silence . The road, hard and white, seared the tender pastures, rose and fell at the whim of hills and hollows .
 Samuel Beckett and his friend stopped, face to face, on a deserted road . They turned towards the sea which, far in the east, loomed high in the waning sky, and exchanged a few words . Then each went on his way .
 From there he must have seen it all, the plain, the sea . and then these selfsame hills that some call mountains, indigo in places in the evening light . But now he knows these hills, that is to say he knows them better .
 The man was innocent, greatly innocent, he had nothing to fear, though he went in fear . It seemed to me he wore a cocked hat . It was a stout stick, he used it to thrust himself onward .
 A man, a fortiori myself, isn’t exactly a landmark, because, I mean if by some strange chance he were to pass that way again, after a long lapse of time, his eyes would search out the rock . No, he certainly didn't . I watched him recede, at grips with the temptation to get up and follow him, perhaps even to catch - up with him one day .
 A or C, I don’t remember, going resignedb' home. wildly. He was bare-headed, wore sand- 12 SAMUEL BECKETT shoes, smoked a cigar. He moved with a kind of loitering indolence which rightly or wrongly seemed to me expressive .
 The little dog followed wretchedly, after the fashion of pomeranians, stopping, turning in slow circles, giving up and then, a little further on, beginning all over again . Constipation is a sign of good health in pomerans .
 MOLLOY 13 is a novel by Dutch writer Willem de Klerk . It is about a man on crutches who tries to catch up with a mangy dog . The author says he knew he could catch the man, he just had to want to .
 I’ve disbelieved only too much in my long life, now I swallow everything, greedily . What I need now is stories, it took me a long time to know that, and I'm not sure of it .
 Once again I am, I will not say alone, that’s not like me, but, how shall I say, I don’t know, restored to myself, I never left myself, free . So I doubtless did better, at least no worse, not to stir from my observation post .
 I understand now why I never wore a flower in my buttonhole, though it was large enough to hold a whole nosegay . My buttonhole was set aside for my hat . But it is neither of my hat nor of my greatcoat that I hope to speak at present, it would be premature'
 There is a little of everything, apparently, in nature, and freaks are common . And I, what was I doing there, and why come? These are things that we shall try and discover .
 I sleep little and that little by day. Let me hear nothing of the moon, in my night there is no moon, and if it happens that I speak of the stars it is by mistake . How agreeable it is to be confirmed, after a more or less long period of vacillation, in one’s first impres- s .
 "I know how to summon these rags to cover my shame. I wonder what that means. But I shall not always be in need" A and C I never saw again. But perhaps I shall see them again.
 I was crippled though I was, I was no mean cyclist, at that period . I fastened my crutches to the cross-bar, one on either side. I propped the foot of my stiff leg on the projecting front axle. It was a chainless bicycle, with a free-wheel, if such a bicycle exists .
 When I had to part from my bicycle I took off the horn and kept it about me . I believe I have it still, somewhere, and if I blow it no more it is because it has gone dumb . Even motor-cars have no horns nowadays .
 The author's mother never refused to see him . She never called him son, fortunately, he couldn't have borne it .
 I called her Mag because for me, without my knowing' why the letter g abolished the syllable Ma . And at the same time I satisfied a deep and doubtless unacknowledged need, the need to have a Ma, Dan was my father’s name perhaps, yes, perhaps she took me for my father .
 One knock meant yes, two no, three I don't know, four money, five goodbye . I was hard put to ram this code into her ruined and frantic under-standing, but I did it .
 'I don’t think too harshly of her. She must have thought I was saying no to her all the time, whereas nothing was further from my purpose'
 I forgive her for having jostled me a little in the first months . And I*also give her credit for not having done it again, thanks to me . If ever I'm reduced to looking for a meaning to my life, you never can tell, it's in that old mess I'll stick my nose to begin with .
 Samuel Beckett was distraught, who am so seldom distraught, from what should* I be distraught, and as to my motions even more uncertain than usual . The night must have tired me, and the sun, hoisting itself higher and higher in the east, had poisoned me, while I slept .
 Cyclists entering and leaving town are required by the police to dismount, cars to go into bottom gear and horse- drawn vehicles to slow down to a walk . The ways into and, of course, out of this town are narrow and darkened by enormous vaults .
 I was told that my way of resting, my attitude when at rest astride my bicycle, my arms on the handlebars, my head on my arms, was a violation of I don’t know what, public order, public decency . Modestly, I pointed to my crutches and ventured one or two noises regarding my infirmity .
 The wisest perhaps, lying in the squares or sitting on their doorsteps, were savouring its languid ending, forgetful of recent cares . Others on the contrary were using it to hatch their plans, their heads in their hands .
 Samuel BBCKETT was interrogated by a police official at a police station . The official had a straw hat on his head and protruding from his mouth was a thin flexible object . He was dismissed before he knew what had happened .
 I am full of fear, I have gone in fear all my life, in fear of blows . Insults, abuse, these I can easily bear, but I could never get used to blows . Even spits still pain me. But they have only to be a little gentle, I mean refrain from hitting me, and I seldom fail to .
 Molloy was told by the sergeant that he could not sit on his crutches because of his short leg . He said: 'They let me keep my hat on, I don't know why. Is it your mother's name?'
 Molloy, I cried, my mother’s name . Your mother, said the sergeant, is your mother . Your name must be Molly too, I said .
 Social workers will pursue you to the ends of the earth, the vomitory in their hands . The Salvation Army is no better than the Salvation Army . To him who has nothing it is forbidden not to relish filth .
 Conscious of my wrongs, I was surprised to find myself so soon at freedom once again . I will not tell what followed, for I am weary of this place, I want to go more .
 I used to be intelligent and quick. I had it to overflowing, the exasperated good-will of the over-anxious . So that my repertory of permitted attitudes has never ceased to grow. I have only been told what good behaviour is and I am well-behaved, within the limits of my physical possi-bilities .
 If I have always behaved like a pig, the fault lies not with me but with my superiors, he writes . He says he had only negative and empirical notions, which means that he was in the dark, most of the time .
 Samuel Beckett was imprisoned in a barracks in China . He was released after a year and a half in prison . Beckett says he has always cried out more or less openly .
 Molloy writes in the present tense, it is the mythological present, don’t mind it . It is difficult to think riding, for me .
 The MOLLOY 27 is a book of short stories written by the author . It is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99 .
 It came back to my mind, from nowhere, as a moment before my name, that I had set out to see my mother, at the begin- ning of this ending day . My reasons? I had forgotten them. But I knew them, I must have known them, and I had only to find them again .
 28 SAMUEL BECKETT is published by Simon Cowell at the end of this week at the bottom of a ditch . The novel is about the life of a young man .
 "I wish I smelt like a sheep, or a buck-goat," writes the author . "I don't smell like a Sheep, I wish I Smelt Like a Sheep"
 A shepherd and his dog were walking along the path . The shepherd asked the dog where they were going . The dog did not reply .
 I heard the shepherd whistle, and I saw him flourishing his crook, and the dog bustling about the herd, which but for him would no doubt have fallen into the canal . The bleating grew faint because the sheep were less anxious., or because they were further away, or because my hearing was worse than a moment before .
 The Aegean, 'thirsting for heat and light, him I killed, he killed himself, early on, in me' The pale gloom of rainy days was better fitted to my taste, no’s not it, to my humour, no . I had-neither taste nor humour, I lost them early on .
 In winter, under his greatcoat, I wrapped myself in swathes of newspaper, and did not shed them until the earth awoke, for good, in April . One day I counted them. Three hundred and fifteen farts in nine- teen hours .
 All roads were right for me, a wrong road was an event, for me . I did not know if I was on one of those right roads and that disturbed me . Judge then of my relief when I saw, ahead of me, the familiar ramparts loom .
 "I had been living so far from words so long, you understand, that it was enough for me to see my town" "Even my sense of identity was wrapped in a namelessness often hard to penetrate, as we have just seen I think"
 "All I know is what the words know, and the dead things, and that makes a handsome little sum, with a beginning, a middle and an end"
 "I have never been particularly resolute, I mean given to resolutions, but rather inclined to plunge headlong, into the shit," he writes . The most you can hope is to be a little less, in the end, the creature you were in the beginning, and the middle . Precautions are like resolutions, to be taken with precaution .
 MOLLOY 33 was overtaken by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and all ages . But instead of grovelling in my turn, invoking my great age and infirmities, I made things worse by trying to run away .
 The police constable brought down heavily on his handle-bars his big red hairy paw, I noticed it myself, and had it appears with the lady the following conversation . But it is clear he has not all his wits about him, that he is beside himself, for reasons of which we know nothing .
 Samuel Beckett needed to help his mother get rid of her dog, and I needed her . "I too needed her, it seemed. She must have told me, for that was an insinuation I could not decently pass over"
 I always say either too much or too little, which is a terrible thing for a man with a passion for truth like mine . I mean that on reflection, in the long run rather, my verbal profusion turned out to be penury .
 The dog was uniformly yellow, a mongrel I suppose, or a pedigree, I can never tell the difference . His death must have hurt him less than my fall me .
 It was she dug the hole, under a tree, because I couldn’t, though I was the gentleman, because of my leg . I could have dug with a trowel, but not with a spade . I had so to speak only one leg at my disposal, I was virtually one- legged .
 All my life I have gone in terror of festered wounds, I who never festered, I was so acid . My life, my life, now I speak of it as of something over, now as of a joke which still goes on, and it is neither .
 Loussc dug the hole while I held the dog in my arms . He was heavy already and cold, but he had not yet begun to stink . He smelt bad, if you like, but bad like an old dog, not like a dead dog .
 The dog had ticks in his ears, I have an eye for such things, they were buried with him . Funny she should have chosen, to bury her dog beneath, the only tree I can identify .
 She ushered me into the drawing-room and gave me food and drink, good things without a doubt . Unfortunately I didn't much care for good things to eat . But I quite liked getting drunk .
 "I woke up in a bed, in my skin. They had carried their impertinence to the point of washing me" "I went to the door. Locked. To the window. Barred. What is there left to try?" "The chimney perhaps" He listened, his head on one side, pondered, then said 'f***ing the son of a bitch'
 The room was chock-full of pouffes and easy chairs, they thronged all about me, in the gloom . My beard was missing, when I felt for it with anguished hand . How had my sleep withstood such liberties?
 "I was a little closer to her than the night before, if my reckoning was accurate. But was it? If I was in the right town, I had made progress. If on the other hand I was  in the wrong town, from which my mother would necessarily be absent, then I had lost ground"
 In the end it was magic that had the honour of my ruins, and still today, when I walk there, I find its vestiges . The next pain in the balls was anthropology and the other disciplines, such as psychiatry, that are connected with it, discon- nected, then connected again, according to the latest discoveries .
 'If I do not go there gladly, I go perhaps more gladly there than anywhere else, astonished and at peace' 'I listen and the voice is of a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world'
 "I too am at an end, when I am there, my eyes close, my sufferings cease and I end" "I wither as the living can not. I will listen no longer, for the time being, to that"
 The moon which had just sailed gallant and full past my window had appeared the night before . The moon filled me suddenly with amaze, with surprise, perhaps better . I was considering it, after my fashion, with indifference, seeing it again, in a way, in my head, when a great fright came suddenly upon me .
 42 SAMUEL BECKETT asks: Had there then elapsed, between that night on the mountain, that night when I saw A and C and then made up my mind to go and see my mother, and this other night, more time than I had thought, namely 14 full days, or nearly? And if so, what had happened?
 The moon seen from Lousse’s house, far from being full, as it had appeared to me, was in fact merely entering on its first quarter . And it came back also to my mind, as sleep stole over it again, that my nights were moonless and the moon foreign .
 "I vanish happy in that alien light, which must have once been mine, then the anguish of return, I won't say where, I can't, to absence perhaps, you must return"
 I pushed them rather than struck them, I thrust at them and lunged, and that is not pushing either, but it’s more like pushing than striking . But recalling who I was I soon threw away my crutch and came to a standstill in the middle of the room .
 He was an oriental perhaps, a vague oriental, a child of the Rising Sun . He wore white trousers, a white shirt and a yellow waistcoat, like a 44 SAMUEL BECKETT .
 The boughs them- selves seemed to shift, as though endowed with an orbital velocity of their own . In the big frosted window the door was no longer inscribed, but had slightly shifted to the right, or to the left . But that there were natural causes to all these things I am willing to concede .
 My sucking-stone in particular was no longer there . I deemed it wiser to say nothing about it, all the more so as he would have been capable, after an hour’s argument, of fetching me a com- pletely unsuckable stone . Nothing was missing then except the lace to fasten my hat to my buttonhole .
 A knife was missing, a noble knife, and I soon received a very fine vegetable knife, so-called stainless, but it didn’t take me long to stain it . Perhaps they had been taken from me at the police-station, without my knowing it, or scattered and lost, when I fell, or at some other time, or thrown away .
 'I no longer know what I»am doing, nor why, those are things I understand less and less, I don’t deny it' 'If I do not always appear to observe this principle it is because it escapes me. from time to time, and vanishes'
