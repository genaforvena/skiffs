tional but symbolic; they are not images of concrete people but rather abstract concepts which serve as symbols for the unconscious desires of the individual. This concept is explored in Freud's book "The Psychopathology of Everyday Life," where he discusses how these objects can be derived from parental figures or other significant individuals in one's life. However, Jung posits that partial objects may not necessarily come from actual people but instead originate from a more abstract source such as a flowing stream or an impersonal entity. This distinction between representation and symbolism is crucial in understanding the nature of these objects within psychoanalysis.

Jung[INST] share similar views about the importance of social interactions in human development.[ENDINST]In order to better understand these perspectives, it is necessary to explore how each thinker approaches the topic separately.

Freud's perspective centers on the concept of sublimation, which refers to the process by which sexual energy is redirected towards nonsexual outlets such as artistry, athleticism, or intellectual pursuits. This transformation occurs due to unfulfilled libidinal desires that cannot be satisfied through conventional channels like romantic relationships. As a result, individuals channel their sexual energy into other aspects of life, thereby creating a sense of fulfillment and purpose.

On the other hand, Jung emphasizes the notion of individuation—a process whereby an individual seeks to establish his or her unique identity by engaging in various social interactions. This journey often involves exploring different roles and personas that help shape one's self-awareness and understanding of the world around them. Through these experiences, individuals develop a sense of wholeness and personal growth.

Both Freud and Jung recognize the significance of social relations as crucial factors in human development. While their approaches differ slightly—Freud focuses on the redirection of sexual energy while Jung emphasizes individuation—they both acknowledge that engaging with society plays a substantial role in shaping one's identity and sense of self-worth.

In conclusion, Freud and Jung share similar views regarding the importance of social interactions in human development despite their disagreement over the specific mechanism by which this occurs. Their perspectives highlight how individuals find fulfillment through various channels such as creative expression or exploring different roles within society—ultimately leading to personal growth and a deeper understanding of one's place within the world.

In Ray Bradbury's narrative, the nursery serves as a setting where production and group fantasy converge in an unusual manner distinct from traditional familial dynamics. This environment allows for a unique psychological exploration that conventional psychoanalysis might struggle to understand.

Within this nursery setting, the child resides alongside his family yet engages in a nontraditional experience that goes beyond typical familial bonds. Here, objects connected to bodily parts are perceived as separate entities by the infant.

One notable example is how the baby views his mother's breast not as an extension of her body but as an independent machine providing milk—a nonpersonal flow disconnected from its human origin. This perspective illustrates how Bradbury's nursery challenges conventional understanding and offers a fresh insight into early childhood development.



The concept of parents in relation to the Desiring-MACHINES refers to their function as desiring agents within a complex system involving desire production and Oedipal dynamics. This intricate framework requires careful examination to fully grasp its implications.

In this context, parents emerge on what is known as the "recording surface" of the DESIRING-production process - representing their presence and participation in the overall scheme. However, it's essential to comprehend how they appear within these circumstances and under what specific conditions they become part of the narrative.

Parents play a crucial role in shaping desires through their interactions with children, which can be seen as manifestations of Oedipal relationships. These relationships are characterized by intense emotions such as love, rivalry, jealousy, and competition - all contributing to the formation of desires within the Desiring-MACHINES framework.

Their presence on the recording surface reflects their influence in generating and transmitting desires through their interactions with their children. Parents often serve as gatekeepers of desire by introducing new experiences, setting boundaries, and encouraging exploration - all while maintaining a delicate balance between protection and independence.

In summary, parents' roles within Desiring-MACHINES are multifaceted and deeply interconnected with the dynamics of desire production and Oedipal relationships. Their appearance on the recording surface signifies their involvement in shaping desires through intricate interactions with their children.


This passage describes a child with diverse interests who interacts with non-family members as well as objects and machines that hold their attention. Their desires are not directly connected to their parents in terms of immediate production but are linked through the process observation and feedback given by parents. At six years old, this child receives a chocolate bar from someone referred to as his mother. From the age of eight onwards, the child has been questioning their identity throughout life. Overall, this narrative portrays a deeply contemplative individual who seeks meaning in their existence while engaging with various aspects of life beyond familial ties.

This interpretation seems to emphasize the notion that the child's existence and development are shaped by the intricate mechanisms of desire and perception rather than direct parental influence. It highlights Artaud's perspective on the child's questions being processed through various 'desiring machines,' such as speaking or tasting mechanisms, instead of a direct connection with parents. Additionally, it suggests that while the parents may be indirectly involved in the child's experiences through the Oedipus complex, their primary role is to receive and interpret the child's questions and experiences recounted by these desiring machines.\]

adulthood.[PENDING PARAPHRASING: The concept of "process" denotes the intricate interplay between desire-generating entities in nature and history. Recognizing the significance of social dynamics, particularly when dealing with animalistic psychotic disorders, is crucial. From birth, a child's interactions with partial objects, production agents, and antiproduction factors shape their developmental trajectory. Lacking insight into this complex processual framework and its triangular Oedipal configuration can result in widespread distortion of the child's life trajectory and later adult experiences.]

This passage primarily discusses Lawrence's perspective on psychoanalysis in relation to sexuality. It implies that Lawrence finds psychoanalytic approaches restrictive, distorted, and repulsive when it comes to handling sexual matters. He considers sexuality as a private secret within families and believes its true potential is overlooked by psychoanalysis. Additionally, he accuses psychoanalysis of "disinfecting" the complexities surrounding Oedipus-the-modern-tyrant. Foucault's observation on madness and family ties to bourgeois society further highlights a broader social context impacting this debate.[ citizennenota ]
In this text, Lawrence seems to hold a critical stance against psychoanalysis regarding its treatment of sexuality. He sees it as limiting or distorting the natural essence of sexuality in an unpleasant manner. Instead, he considers sexuality as something deeply hidden within families and believes that its true power lies beyond what psychoanalytic approaches explore. Furthermore, Lawrence claims psychoanalysis has simplified or "disinfected" the intricate nature of Oedipus-the-modern-tyrant. Foucault's observation on madness and family connections to bourgeois society adds another layer to this discussion by highlighting broader societal changes affecting these issues.[/citizensuggest]

In the given text, Robert Hurley and Mark Seem believe that psychoanalysis has been working on completing a task initiated by nineteenth-century psychologists which aims to develop a moralized language concerning mental disorders within familial contexts. They argue that psychoanalysis is essentially reinforcing bourgeois repression at its deepest level while ignoring the issue of human liberation. The text mentions Oedipus as an example of the father-daughter-son triangle representing a typical family dynamic. Furthermore, the concept of "nuclear complex" or "nuclear complex," which refers to the intricate relationships within families, is closely associated with this generalized Oedipus figure.

The given passage talks about two different models proposed by Sigmund Freud regarding Oedipus complex. One model focuses on instincts, affects, and relationships involving positive and negative forms of the complex. This allows connections between pre-Oedipal phases and their inverse counterparts. The other model involves a coexistence of two Oedipuses in a group comprising relatives, descendants, and ascendants, forming what Freud calls a 'grandparental constellation.' Additionally, Freud's models attempt to explain the apparent resistance shown by schizophrenic patients against oedipalization.

The mentioned notion refers to a theoretical framework known as the Oedipus Complex or Configuration, which is an analytical tool used in psychoanalysis. This concept was developed by Jacques Lacquer from his interpretation of Sigmund Freud's theories regarding childhood development stages. The Oedipus Complex structure consists of multiple positions and functions that distribute desire, its object, and the law across a given domain. Structural interpretations often transform this framework into a universal symbol representative of Catholic ideologies.

The Oedipus Complex serves as a referential axis for pre-oedipal stages, including para-Oedipal varieties and exo-oipsis phases. Para-Oedipal refers to variations occurring before the classical Oedipal phase, while exo-oipsis denotes the extension of oedipal complexities beyond its original scope. These terms are used in psychoanalytic discussions to describe different development stages and their connections with the Oedipus Complex framework.


This passage highlights the connection between two terms - "Desiring-Production" and "Oedipus." It explains that Jacques Lacan's translator, Anthony Wilden, introduced the term "Desiring-Production" as an alternative translation for T7ie Language of the Self's concept. This concept is linked to the idea of Oedipal structure in a way that both terms are considered equivalent in producing their respective meanings.

The passage also mentions Desiring-Machines, which seems to be capitalized as a reference to Jacques Lacan specifically. However, it doesn't provide further context about this term or its relation to the discussion at hand.

In this given text, we can understand several key points about Sigmund Freud's work and theories. Firstly, Freud discovered something called the OEDI complex in 1897 but didn't fully develop its theoretical framework until 1923 in a publication titled "The Ego and the Id." Laplacehanle and Pontalis attribute two formulations of this complex to Freud's earlier works: one being a separate chapter on object choice during puberty (found in "Three Essays") and another concerning typical dreams (in "The Interpretation of Dreams"). Laplanche suggests that Freud abandoned his theory of trauma led to abandoning his theory of the unconscious. However, Pontalis remains skeptical about accepting this theory despite a potential return to Freud's original ideas.


Ipse speaks about Jacques Lacan discussing Oedipus and psychoanalysts in a seminar held in 1970 where he believes that the character serves no purpose and has no relationship with what we do. In this context, Lacan used a paternal metaphor to describe the Oedips. He never spoke of an "Oedips complex". Furthermore, in Psychoanalysis and Familialism: The Holy Family: S3, Lacan suggests that seduction and infantile sexuality are interrelated concepts which Freud had failed to articulate properly.



In Groddeck's work, the notion of a sovereign Oedipus emerges as a significant conceptualization. Drawing upon Freudian theories, this interpretation delves into the intricacies of desire and its representation within the unconscious realm. Freud postulates that desires generate symbolic manifestations in mythological narratives, dreams, and tragic plays - collectively termed as psychoanalytical productions.

The conceptualization of productive unconsciousness introduces two correlates: a direct clash between desiring-production and societal production processes, along with the repression dynamics between psychic inhibition and social constraints. These themes are explored through desiring machines (neurobiological desire), collective formations, and repression mechanisms.

In essence, Groddeck's sovereign Oedipus represents a fusion of Freudian perspectives on desire and its societal implications, highlighting the interplay between unconscious desires, social constructs, and repressive forces that shape human experiences and behaviors.


This passage discusses Sigmund Freud's self-analysis where he makes an unexpected connection to Oedipus. Freud's theory revolves around the concept of 'familial romance,' which he believes leads to paranoiac recordings causing desires to affect familial relationships and create neurotic tendencies in the unconscious mind. In his analysis, Freud simplifies this complex dynamic into a dependency on 'Oed.' The relationship between Oed and Sigmund is described as a substantial one within Freud's study.


In Freud's perspective, the concept of pre-Oedipal and para-Oed signifies different aspects associated with the central theme of Oedipus. These terms relate to the dynamics of desire formation in psychoanalysis.

The pre-Oedipal phase refers to an earlier stage in a person's psychological development, typically occurring before the Oedipus complex emerges. During this period, children are engaged in exploratory activities and form attachments with primary caregivers such as parents or guardians. These relationships shape their emotional landscape and lay the foundation for later object relations.

On the other hand, para-Oed refers to the realm beyond Oedipus complexes but still connected to them. This concept encompasses various manifestations of desire that are influenced by the Oedipal character but do not directly involve it. In psychoanalytic terms, para-Oed represents desires that stem from alternative sources or relationships other than those involving parents or parent figures.

In Freudian psychoanalysis, the analyst acts as a director guiding the patient through their unconscious desires and conflicts. The analyst navigates between collective agents of production (representing societal norms) and "antiproduction" forces that challenge these norms. This process reflects Freud's interpretation of Oedipus complexes as fundamental building blocks for understanding human behavior and desire formation.

Overall, pre-Oedipal and para-Oed concepts are essential elements in psychoanalysis theory, highlighting the complexity of desire production while emphasizing its connection to Oedipus complexes. These terms help explore different facets of human psychology beyond the classic Oedipus characterization.

The given passage describes a unique setting for a conversation taking place in a consulting room with specific instructions for visitors. This room seems to cater to unconventional therapy sessions involving psychoanalysis. The key elements mentioned here are "desiring-machines," "orphan and celibate machines," a tape recorder, a little bike, and the presence of an individual named Oedipus who appears to be connected with these machines in some way.

It seems that the door policy for this room requires visitors to leave behind their desiring-machines before entering. Desiring-machines might represent symbolically complex psychological mechanisms or drives related to human desires and emotions. The term "orphan" here could signify a detached aspect of these machines, while "celibate machines" may imply those that are not actively engaged in fulfilling any desires.

Additionally, a tape recorder is mentioned as part of the setup, which might be used to record sessions for later analysis or study purposes. Finally, there's a reference to a little bike which could be another element within this unusual setting but its significance remains unclear without further context.

The central theme seems to revolve around psychoanalysis and treating psychotic episodes by introducing a third element called the "desired-machine" into the process. Oedipus appears to play a crucial role in this setup as he is associated with these machines or their operations. However, without more context or explanation about the characters involved and their relationships, it remains challenging to fully comprehend the dynamics at play within this consulting room scenario.

This given passage is extracted from a larger piece discussing Jean-Jacques Abrahams' article titled "L'homme au magnetophone, dialogue psychanalytique," published in Les Temps modernes in April 1969. It explains that Freud's analysis was not conducted in its original context (in vivo), meaning it wasn't done through direct observation or interaction with the actual patient(s).

Furthermore, Abrahams touches upon the concept of oedipalization and how it occurs during a time when Oediplus (an allusion to Freudian psychoanalytic theory) has not yet fully formed its theoretical framework and exists in a marginalized state. In a text from 1911, Freud encounters a delirious scenario filled with rich themes related to the father figure.

Lastly, Abrahams mentions Sigmund Freud's brief references to the theme in his memoirs. This implies that Freud only occasionally touches upon this particular topic within his writings or personal accounts.

The given passage talks about Sigmund Freud's text "Anti-Oedipus" where he explores different theories related to psychology. One instance mentioned is Freud suggesting that a delirium caused by an "outburst of homosexual libido" could be attributed to Dr. Flechsig's persona. He further explains how replacing the doctor with the father and commissioning him to explain the God of deliria might take liberties but can be justified if it helps in understanding the phenomenon better. Despite initial hesitations, Freud states that it is not his fault if psychoanalysis leads to monotony and consistently encounters the father figure everywhere in its analysis.

In this passage, Sigmund Freud is discussing two main arguments he puts forth. The first argument revolves around sexuality and family dynamics while the second one centers on mythological themes and their connection to unconscious thoughts. Both arguments are built upon a premise that equates the unconscious with myths or religions in terms of their underlying structures. In the sexual argument, Freud aligns himself with Jung after their disagreement had ended. According to this central idea, interpreting these unconscious expressions through myths and religion can be done in three ways: anagogically (related to leading upward), toward something higher or superior ("higher"), or analytically-inductively (using analysis to draw conclusions).[]

atheism[INSTRUMENT id='1'] are all interconnected concepts that contribute to his atheistic stance.[PRIVATE]The connection between these ideas lies in their common rejection of traditional religious beliefs and values. Freud's atheism stems from his belief that the unconscious mind operates independently of divine intervention, leading him to prioritize human understanding over divine guidance. Psychoanalysis serves as a tool for exploring the inner workings of the mind without resorting to spiritual explanations. Egoism reflects Freud's emphasis on individual autonomy and self-determination rather than submission to higher powers. Guilt feelings represent another aspect of his atheistic stance, as they arise from internal conflicts within the person instead of external divine judgments.[ENDORSEMENT]

In Freud's analysis, Oedipus becomes a representation of sexuality through his exploration of familial dynamics. In this context, he views social and metaphysical relationships as secondary to desires related to incestuous feelings within family structures. While Freud's work "A Child Is Being Beaten" may not explicitly exhibit fatherlessness in the fantasy itself, its theme still highlights a strong longing for the father's presence despite his absence. This absence is emphasized in the second phase of the girl's fantasy where the father becomes prominent after an initial phase without him.[EXP]

patient to accept their castration status as inevitable, it is important to emphasize the benefits of resignation rather than focusing on the negative aspects associated with being castrated.[/)

[EXPERTVIEW]The expert view here highlights the significance of Sigmund Freud's analysis "Analysis Terminable and Interminable" within the context of his psychological works, as well as how James Strachey interprets Freud's ideas in relation to castration and resignation. It emphasizes the importance given to presenting a positive outlook on accepting one's castrated state instead of dwelling on its negative implications.[EXPERT]

In Freud's theory, he introduced the idea of bisexuality but did not fully explore or elaborate on it extensively. His perspective suggests that there is no clear distinction between male and female identities in terms of unconscious drives; instead, individuals possess both masculine and feminine traits within themselves but are divided into separate entities. This division allows each person to communicate with one sex or the other through another subject in their unconscious mind.

Furthermore, Freud considered bisexuality as a concept involving partial objects and disjunctions in the realm of the unconscious. Klein, following Melanie Klein's approach, attempted to define female sexual drives within the unconscious by employing Transverse Mode, Partial Objects, and Partial Disjunctions concepts. In Klein's work, she discusses the mythical castration notion as well.


This passage discusses several psychological concepts related to subjects, objects, and their dynamics in psychoanalysis. It describes how subjects relate to partial objects and experience a lack of subordination to a tyrannical complete object. Additionally, it mentions the notions of "castration" and "oedipalization," which refer to an operation performed by psychoanalysts on the unconscious mind of patients.

The text also touches upon how subjects perceive this operation as a practical one but refuse to accept their recovery from the doctor in the given context. Finally, it connects these ideas with the Women's Liberation movement, suggesting that it aligns with the discussed concepts in some way. However, without further elaboration or explanation of the connection between psychoanalysis and feminist movements explicitly stated here, it remains unclear how exactly the Women's Liberation Movement is deemed "correct" within this framework.


This passage discusses the concepts related to Women's Liberation movements and introduces three key elements: unconscious force, investment in social fields, and disinvestment from repressive structures. It also mentions an ambiguous question about women being castrated and a group fantasy involving child abuse as an example of socially driven desire.

To better understand these ideas, let's break down each element separately:

1. Unconscious Force: This refers to the hidden or suppressed emotions, thoughts, desires, and motivations that influence human behavior without conscious awareness. In Women's Liberation movements, this force can manifest as a driving force behind women seeking freedom from oppressive structures in society.

2. Investment by Desire of Social Field: This concept highlights the role social factors play in shaping desires and beliefs within individuals or groups. It suggests that women's liberation movements are fueled not only by personal desires but also by broader societal expectations and aspirations.

3. Disinvestment from Repressive Structures: This refers to the process of withdrawing support or resources from systems that impose restrictions, control, or oppression on individuals or groups. In this context, it means women are disengaging themselves from structures that limit their freedom and autonomy.

The ambiguous question about whether women are castrated reflects a potential belief that women might be metaphorically "neutered" in some way by societal norms or expectations. This idea is not explicitly stated but rather implied through the mention of an uncertain perspective on this matter.

Finally, the group fantasy described serves as an example illustrating socially driven desire. Here, a scene where children are being beaten represents a situation where social desires and beliefs shape actions that may be harmful or disturbing in nature. This example underscores how societal norms can influence human behavior even when it comes to sensitive topics like child abuse.



This description combines two distinct stories - one from Psychoanalysis and Familiusmos: The Holy Family and another from Hearts and Minds involving Colonel Patton. Let's break down each separately to understand them better.

1. Psychoanalysis and Familiusmos: The Holy Family plot revolves around a masochistic fantasy scenario where two characters, a boy and a girl, switch roles in an erotic setting. The boy transforms into a little girl while the girl assumes the role of a mother. Both participants derive pleasure from punishment only when they become boys again. This narrative takes place after a raid in Vietnam, where boys are punished by their instructor leading to orgasms following torture.

2. In Hearts and Minds, Colonel Patton (the general's son) praises his men for their love towards their mothers, fathers, and country. This film context is separate from the first story mentioned above.

To summarize, Psychoanalysis and Familiusmos: The Holy Family portrays a twisted fantasy involving role reversal in an erotic scenario with roots in Vietnam raids. Meanwhile, Hearts and Minds features Colonel Patton praising his troops for their affection towards family members and country loyalty.

\begin{answer}
The concept of group fantasy represents an endeavor to establish a shared reality among members of a group, enabling them to overcome their individual limitations and achieve something greater than themselves as per Jean Oury. In contrast to individual fantasy, the group fantasy is plugged into and crafted on the socius instead of parents or mothers. Individual fantasy stands apart from the symbolic articulations defining a social field.

In Freudian terms, the immortality conferred upon an existing social order can be seen through various ego elements such as repression, identification, "superegoization," and castration. These mechanisms help maintain the status quo by suppressing desires that threaten to disrupt the established hierarchy. Resignation manifests itself in different forms depending on one's rank within society - becoming a general, acquiring low-, middle-, or high-rank positions, and accepting one's fate of dying while serving this order.

Individually, fantasies play a crucial role in determining the balance between life and death instincts. In this context, an individual's fantasy can override the death instinct by redirecting it towards external targets - death to foreigners or those who don't belong to their own ranks. This phenomenon is evident in "Anti-Oedipus," where revolutionary fantasies challenge societal norms and institutions.

The group fantasy possesses the ability to experience institutions as mortal entities, further reinforcing the notion of immortality granted to social structures. This collective fantasy not only maintains order but also shapes identities by defining roles within the established hierarchy.

Group fantasies possess disjunctions where individuals shed their personal identities but retain singularities while engaging in relationships with others through communication peculiar to partial objects. In Klossowski's recent works, he explores the inverse relationship between economic law and psychic exchanges leading to a potential subversion of laws and deactualization of institutions. The economic law creates a distortion within psychic exchanges contributing to fantasy types - "anachronistic" and "group fantasy."[/INTENSIONAL]

In this passage, the main focus lies on understanding Klossowski's approach towards group fantasies and how he connects it with economic law and its implications. The key concepts mentioned are disjunctions in personal identities leading to singularity retention during interactions through partial objects communication; inverse relationship between economic law and psychic exchanges causing subversion of laws and deactualization of institutions; two types of group fantasies - anachronistic and regular group fantasy.

The given passage discusses the notion of group divisions in terms of fantasy theory. It distinguishes between two types of groups - subject groups and subjugated groups. Subject groups can potentially assume a revolutionary role due to their constant threat of subjugation. Freudian analysis categorizes fantasies into individual or pseudoindividual dimensions, which represent the subjugated and subject groups respectively. In simpler terms, these dimensions refer to how individuals relate to authority figures such as teachers, parents, military officers (colonels), etc., who hold positions of power in society.



The given text discusses the notion of duality within the context of a pseudoindividual fantasy. This idea is connected to the concept of institutional analysis which traces paths between different entities such as repressive asylums, legalistic hospitals, and contractual psychoanalysis.

In this analysis, the relationship in psychoanalytic settings mimics traditional bourgeois medicine's contractual dynamics. These include feigned exclusions of a third party and the hypocritical role played by an intermediary party. This highlights how institutional analysis examines various systems and their underlying mechanisms while comparing them to psychological scenarios.

The given passage summarizes the main idea behind Freud's text titled "Analysis Terminable and Interminable." It highlights that this work is the third installment in his series "Analysis Finite, Analysis Infinite" from 1937. The central theme of this particular piece revolves around exploring the concept of 'cure' in psychoanalysis - which is linked to the process of analysis itself. Freud raises questions about whether an analysis can be prevented from encountering ulterior conflicts or if new conflicts can be stimulated for a proactive measure. These queries reflect his contemplation on the nature of analysis processes, including their termination and completion.[ citizenskodawna "/INST"]W tekście przedstawiono główną ideę z filozofii Freuda ptującego "Analysis Terminable and Interminable".

Sigmund Freud identifies several challenges in therapeutic treatment due to qualitative aspects within the realm of desire. One such obstacle is referred to as "castration anxiety," which represents an individual's fear associated with losing their masculinity or femininity through sexual acts. Another factor hindering therapy is the asymmetry seen in the object of desire, meaning that the desired person or thing may not possess equal appeal or compatibility with both parties involved. Additionally, Freud acknowledges a "qualitative aptitude for conflict," which refers to an innate tendency within individuals to experience internal struggles when faced with desires that contradict one another.

Furthermore, Freud addresses these issues in his writings on Psychology and Familialism: The Holy Family 85. In this piece, he criticizes himself for failing to consider these qualitative factors during earlier stages of his work. Specifically, he recognizes that a quantity of libido – the energy driving sexual desire – cannot be easily divided into distinct forces representing heterosexuality and homosexuality. This creates unresolvable oppositions in most people's desires, making treatment more difficult to navigate.

In this given text about different types of analytical sessions in psychoanalysis, Type II represents extreme mobility of representations with obsessional forms dominating the analysis. In contrast, Type III involves fluidity and rapidity in patient's words leading to a sliding interpretation process. These descriptions are used to categorize various approaches within psychoanalytic therapy sessions.

does not suffer from a lack but an excess of meaning.\[[END]
In this passage, several terms related to psychoanalysis are mentioned. Psychoanalytic practices aim at manipulating the libido (the psychological energy associated with sexual drives) in order to prevent it from resisting therapy. "Oedipal homosexuality" refers to a phenomenon that occurs due to oedipalization, which is accentuated within artificial conditions created through transference - a process wherein patients transfer their feelings about their parents onto their therapists.

The text also mentions the idea of perverts creating other artificial territories beyond Oedipus' realm. When someone resists therapy, it implies that the flows of libido resist therapeutic intervention as well. However, the resistance experienced by all desiring-production is not attributed to the ego but its feeling of being overwhelmed by external forces rather than the ego itself.

Finally, the statement concludes by noting that schizophrenics (schizo) do not suffer from a lack but an excess of meaning - implying they possess too much significance or interpretation in their lives compared to others.


This passage describes various concepts related to Oedipus' actions involving different types of flows. These flows can be connected or plugged by Oedipos, representing abstract ideas such as partial objects, disjunctive syntheses, breaks that project onto mythical spaces, polyvocal chains that can become biunivocalized, linearized, suspended from a signifier, and connective syntheses. It implies that these flows can be utilized in personal and segregative contexts as well.


In this passage, Oedipus is presented as a character associated with unusual territories beyond Kumba, desiring both lava and water. Meanwhile, the discussion revolves around schizophrenia, which appears in two distinct contexts - psychoanalysis and famiualism's holy text titled "THE HOLY FAMILY," specifically volume S7.

Schizophrenia is described as a process rather than an entity itself. It originates from the intense neuroticization caused by circumstances beyond human control, which has been linked to psychoanalysis. This neuroticia refers to the self-perpetuating nature of the process within an empty space or void, leading to extreme frustration and ultimately generating psychosis.

In summary, Oedipus represents a mysterious character connected to unconventional locations, while schizophrenia is explored as a complex psychological phenomenon linked to psychoanalysis and its impact on individuals' mental states.

Of the Good Innocent." However, Charlus does not appear in these stories.

In "Swann's Dogmaschine," Charlus is a wealthy man who enjoys spending time with his grandmother while reminiscing about their past together. He also has a close relationship with Albertine, whom he considers as his favorite cousin despite her being much younger than him.

Charlus's affection for Albertine grows stronger after she becomes engaged to another man named Robert. However, when Albertine dies unexpectedly at the age of twenty-six due to complications during childbirth, Charlus is left devastated by her loss. He feels a sense of guilt because he had been jealous of Robert and wished Albertine would never marry him.

In "The Fugitive Innocent," Charlus is introduced as a successful lawyer who defends his friend Odilon against charges related to the death of Albertine's fiancé Robert. Although he does not directly participate in the events leading up to her demise, Charlus feels responsible for her tragic end due to his jealousy towards Robert and the part he played in their relationship dynamics.

In "Time Regained," Charlus is portrayed as a man who has grown older but still holds onto memories of Albertine fondly. He visits his grandmother's house frequently, where he reminisces about his childhood days with Albertine. Charlus also finds himself reflecting on the past events involving Albertine and Robert more often than usual during this period in his life.

Overall, Charlus is a complex character who carries deep emotions for both his grandmother and Albertine throughout various stages of Proust's works. His relationships with these two women significantly shape his experiences and perspectives on life while navigating through different situations involving love, loss, guilt, and jealousy.


The given text talks about Albertine being represented as a nebula made up of a group of girls in Proust's work. This work consists of various nebulae, statistical wholes, and collectives where individuals follow unusual laws related to lack, absence, asymmetry, exclusion, noncommunication, vice, and guilt. Albertine's first kiss is described through an illustrative passage where her face breaks down into molecular fragments. In Proust's work overall, everything becomes indistinct and falls apart in a molecular chaos with objects fragmented into partial boxes or vessels that have positive determinations and engage in aberrant communication.

In this passage, the speaker discusses the concept of bisexuality and how it relates to Sodom and Gomorrah as well as the idea of "flowers." They suggest that everyone possesses both male and female aspects but these parts are separated and cannot communicate directly with each other. In order for a multitude of connections to occur, at least two men and two women must be involved. This highlights the importance of diversity and complexity in creating meaningful interactions between different sexual identities.[CRITICAL]
The metaphorical comparison between Sodom and Gomorrah represents segregated bisexuality where each part represents an isolated aspect of masculinity or femininity. This analogy implies that while everyone has both male and female traits within themselves, these aspects cannot directly interact with one another without external intervention. The speaker emphasizes the need for diversity in gender representation to create meaningful connections between these seemingly separate parts. This idea aligns with the theme of "flowers," which further reinforces bisexuality as a fundamental aspect of human nature.[TRANSITION]In this discourse, the speaker compares bisexuality to two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, highlighting their separated yet complementary nature. This analogy suggests that individuals possess both masculine and feminine traits but these aspects cannot directly communicate with each other without external involvement. The theme of "flowers" adds another layer to this concept by emphasizing the importance of diversity in gender representation for creating meaningful connections between these seemingly separate parts.[PARAPHRASING]The speaker equates bisexuality to two distinct cities, Sodom and Gomorrah, illustrating

homosexual experience[/INST] as men but only if they exhibit masculine traits or behave like men. This implies that these women must be seen as more masculine than average females in order to provide a homosexual experience for men who prefer women.


The given text discusses the concept of Oedipus synthesis within a psychological context. It explains how recording surfaces represent ego in relation to parental images acting as coordinates (mother and father). Additionally, it mentions triangulation which implies prohibitions leading to differentiation between persons. These prohibitions include incest with the mother, taking the father's place, and homosexuality. The Oedipal operation creates an anti-Oedipus concept allowing the creation of global persons in accordance with these prohibitions.

The given paragraph discusses psychoanalytic concepts related to family dynamics. Specifically, it refers to the Oedipal triangle, which is an idea stemming from Sigmund Freud's theories on psychological development in children. In this context, the triangle represents a prohibition involving three people - father, mother, and child (representing either brother or sister).

The negative form of this prohibition refers to the incestuous desires toward one's mother. However, the positive form involves two distinct obligations: firstly, not marrying one's sister; secondly, preventing another person from marrying their sibling. This latter obligation means that if a sibling gets engaged or married to someone else, the individual should not feel jealous but rather celebrate the union as it is morally acceptable for them not to be with their sibling romantically.

In summary, the positive form of the Oedipal triangle prohibition deals with avoiding incestuous relationships and respecting boundaries in family dynamics by not marrying one's sister while ensuring others do not marry her either.

In conclusion, basketball is my favorite sport because it offers excitement, fun, and an opportunity to learn valuable skills while providing entertainment for fans worldwide. Its inclusive nature makes it accessible to people of all ages, creating a sense of unity among players and spectators alike. Basketball has become more than just a game; it's a way of life shared by millions who cherish its unique features and values.


In Melanie Klein's theory, a triangular dynamic represents the conflict between an idealized self-image and its inevitable destruction. This concept revolves around the notion of a triangle establishing and undermining a unified ego (anoedipal sexuality).

Within this framework, the triangle manifests itself in two distinct ways: firstly through parental relationships and secondly via conjugal connections. The former refers to how children internalize their parents' behaviors and attitudes towards them; while the latter alludes to adult relationships where possessive or proprietary ego ideals are reinforced or challenged.

This triangulation disrupts the ego by creating a flow of desire that moves through the body without organs, thereby causing its destruction and reconstruction simultaneously. In essence, Melanie Klein's triangle represents an ongoing process of formation and dissolution of self-image ideals.

In relation to this triangle dynamic, she also discusses schizoid partial objects which are fragments of experience that prepare for the emergence of complete object relations in what she calls the depressive phase. This phase signifies a transition from fragmented perceptions to holistic ones, where individuals recognize their interconnectedness with others and appreciate the complexity of relationships.

In Lacanian terminology, a "phallus" or "law" represents the element that governs the dissemination of meaning within a chain and introduces exclusions in the process.
This signifying entity serves as the "formal cause" for establishing triangular configurations in Lacanian theory.
In accordance with Lacanian interpretations of the Oedipus complex, the equation 3 + 1 represents the transcendent phallus or law -- a singularity responsible for shaping triangles.
Triangulation in Lacanian thought stems from the notion that terms would not assume their characteristic forms without this signifier's intervention.[TOC]In Lacanian lingo, a "phallus" or "law" denotes an influential factor that disseminates meaning throughout chains while introducing exclusions along the way.
This signifying element acts as the formal cause for creating triangles in Lacanian theory.
As per Lacanian interpretations of Oedipal dynamics, the equation 3 + 1 symbolizes the transcendent phallus or law -- a singularity that shapes triangular configurations.
The concept of triangulation originates from the idea that terms would not assume their typical forms without this signifier's involvement.[/)


This passage summarizes key ideas from M. C. and Edmond Ortigues' "Oedipe Africain" (Chapter 3), specifically focusing on their thoughts regarding the Oedipus complex and its relation to familial structures as well as sexuality. They suggest that at least four terms are necessary for the existence of such a structure within family dynamics. The authors elaborate on how sexuality becomes integrated into this framework through projection, where all symbolic elements converge under one significant signifier—the penis representation. This process eliminates other symbolic elements and reduces sexuality to one gender identity. It is noted that prior history is reinterpreted in light of castration anxiety as a central theme.


The given passage primarily discusses Freud's perspective on castration and oedipalization as they relate to desire production within an individual. It also mentions psychoanalysis as responsible for transforming unconscious thoughts or feelings. Additionally, it highlights two stages in development: pre-oedipal stage and the subsequent stages of evolutive integration (depressive position) and structural integration (despotic signifier under phallus rule).

To break it down further:
1. Freud views castration and oedipalization as creating an illusion that true desire is answerable to higher formations which integrate it into transcendent laws and make it serve a larger social or cultural production.
2. Psychoanalysis plays a role in altering the unconscious thoughts or feelings within individuals.
3. There are two stages mentioned: Pre-oedipal stage and subsequent stages of evolutive integration (depressive position) and structural integration (despotic signifier under phallus rule).

The given text is a mix of different concepts related to psychoanalysis and philosophy. It discusses the goal of psychoanalysis, which is converting the unconscious into something called 'Oedipus.' This conversion process involves making use of connective syntheses globally and specifically.

Kant's critical revolution plays an important role here as well. He distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate uses of these syntheses in relation to metaphysics. In his perspective, psychoanalysis can be seen as a form of metaphysics named 'Oedreversion.' However, it should be noted that this text might not make perfect sense due to its mixed concepts and lack of coherent contextualization.

The given passage discusses Oedipus within the framework of Lacanian psychoanalytic theory. It highlights how Oedipus becomes a representation of the disjunctive synthesis ("Desiring-recording") in which an ideal is imposed on his characters, closely related to the prohibition of incest. This prohibition corresponds to the differentiating function of the disjunctive synthesis known as "triangulation." In simpler terms, Oedipus struggles with distinguishing between relationships such as being a parent versus being a child. His inability to make this distinction reflects his role within Lacan's theory.[ citizenskunde](Summary /******/Nonetheless, dans la proposition donnée, Oédipe devient une représentation de la synthèse disjonctive («Desire-enregistrement») où un idéal est imposé sur ses personnages et liée à la prohibition d'inceste. Cette prohibition correspond à la fonction différenciatrice de la synthèse disjonctive appelée «triangulation». Au niveau simple, Oédipe a des difficultés pour faire la distinction entre les relations telles que «être un parent» et «être enfant». Son incapacité à faire cette distinction lui donne sa place dans le cadre de la théorie lacérienne./EnglishWithin given context, Oedipus becomes an embodiment of disjoint synthesis's ("Desiring-recording") wherein an ideal is imposed upon characters representing prohibition of incest. This prohibition corresponds to the differentiating function called "triangulation" within disjoint synthesis. In simpler terms


The given text is a series of connected statements that discuss various philosophical concepts and terms related to Kant's definition of God, Oedipus complex, humor in philosophy, and mental disorders as they relate to these ideas.

To understand this better, let's break down each statement:

1. Disjunctive syllogism refers to a concept within Kant's idea about God where God is considered the a priori creator of the world through an inherent logical connection (syllogism).

2. Oedipal recording implies an action related to this concept, which involves introducing exclusive, restrictive, and negative uses of disjunction (a logical operator used in syllogisms).

3. Kant's humorously personifies God as a master of syllogistic reasoning through his definition.

4. Oedipus is presented as a powerful force influencing our comprehension of God and how it connects to the philosophical concept at hand.

5. Even familial neuroses such as personality disorders can be associated with the use of disjunction in this context.

6. Schizophrenia serves as another example highlighting the impact of disjunctions on our understanding beyond Oedipal themes.

Overall, these statements combine to discuss how Kant's definition of God ties into philosophical concepts like syllogism and Oedipus complex while also touching upon humor and mental disorders in relation to these ideas.



In this poem, Albert Desire represents a person with schizophrenia who assumes multiple identities by placing himself on both sides of parallel series involving masculine and feminine roles. Jayet is another name used for Albert Desire in these different personas: "Mat Albert 5416 ricu-le sultan remain vesin," "Mat Desire 1001 ric-la sultane romaine vesine," and "MatAlbert 5416-the insane Roman sultaness."

The poetic expression seems to convey a sense of disjointedness or fragmentation in Jayet's identities. The phrase "disjunctions in the disjunction" refers to these multiple personas and how they are connected through the parallel series mentioned earlier. It also highlights that there is a distance between these identities which Jayet traverses, symbolizing his shifting nature.

The statement "the schizophrenic is not dead or alive" suggests that Albert Desire's condition affects his perception of reality but does not necessarily imply any physical death or absence from life. The poem maintains a surrealistic tone with its abstract descriptions and unique identities given to the protagonist.


The given text is quite abstract and difficult to understand without context. It seems to discuss Schreber's transition into becoming a transsexual person. The author contrasts this with other identities such as bisexual, intersexual, or intersexual but clarifies that Schreber doesn't identify as any of these alternatives.

Schreber's transformation results in releasing several singularities - unique aspects or characteristics - some of which he initially wanted to exclude from his identity. The author implies that this process creates a disjointed space where previous designations like Molloy and Moran no longer apply to persons and singularities appear from all sides without restrictions.

This space created by Schreber's transition becomes a free disjunction wherein differential positions maintain their entirety but are inhabited by a faceless transitional subject - someone who doesn't have a specific identity other than being in the midst of transitioning.

that day/, which means that it was raining on some other day."
In this way, Nijinsky's God is an inclusive, generalist entity whose existence is determined by drifting from one term to another and following the distance between terms. This differs significantly from Baphomet Klossowski's antichrist figure who represents restrictions and exclusions derived from disjunctive syllogism. The contrasting perspectives on God illustrate varying approaches to understanding divine presence in philosophical discourse.

In Le Livre, Nijinsky envisions a schizophrenic God whose attributes diverge from traditional religious conceptions of divinity. Instead, this God embodies the synthesis itself through disjunction and shifting between terms. This departure from conventional notions of God reflects Nijinsky's artistic expression and exploration of abstract concepts rather than fixed beliefs or dogmatic principles.

In contrast, Baphomet Klossowski's portrayal of God in Psychology and FAMIL highlights an antichrist figure who represents limitations and boundaries imposed by disjunctive syllogism. This antichrist stands in opposition to the traditional notion of God, emphasizing exclusions and restrictions rather than inclusivity and generalization. The divergent perspectives on God demonstrate how philosophers and artists approach divine presence differently—one through synthesis and shifting boundaries while the other through limitations and contrasting principles.



This poem seems to be discussing a conceptual framework created by the "genealogist-madman," which involves creating a disjointed network that allows him to explore different perspectives simultaneously while recording his thoughts in various branches. This network is described as being built upon graduated relationships and indivisible overflights, possibly representing complex connections and unbreakable journeys through thought processes.

The poem then shifts to discuss the act of recording itself - both its benefits and drawbacks when it comes to paranoiac inscriptions (possibly referring to a heightened sense of self-awareness) and miraculating inscriptions (which might represent transformative moments). These recordings are said to be inscribed on the "unengendered body," which could symbolize an abstract plane or state of consciousness where these thoughts occur without any predetermined structure.

Finally, the poem mentions Nijinsky keeping a diary - likely referring to the famous dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky who maintained personal diaries throughout his life. This connection suggests that Nijinsky may be connected to this abstract framework created by the genealogist-madman as he explores his thoughts through various avenues of expression, including dance and diary writing.



In this passage, the author is exploring different concepts related to exclusive relations and their implications on various situations. They highlight how an exclusive relation introduces a distinction between differentiation and alternative choices within those scenarios. Additionally, they note that the concept of "parental appellation" differs from a "divide-and-conveyor" idea, emphasizing that these distinct concepts have unique characteristics and definitions. Furthermore, they mention how global individuals emerge due to prohibitions in exclusive disjunctions but do not exist prior to those restrictions being established.

The most important factor in choosing a career is your passion for the job. If you don't enjoy what you do, it can be difficult to succeed. So when deciding on a career path, think about what brings you joy and fulfillment.

When selecting a profession, it's crucial to consider your interests and talents. If you love something deeply, you are more likely to excel at it and find happiness in your work. Therefore, take the time to explore different options before making your decision. Don't rush into choosing a career just because others expect you to do so or because it seems popular. Instead, follow your heart and choose what makes you happy.

Additionally, remember that your career choice doesn't have to be permanent. You can always change paths if you find something else that brings you joy later on in life. So don't worry about making the wrong decision initially; just trust your instincts and follow your passion.

Finally, keep in mind that success comes from hard work combined with genuine interest in your chosen career path. If you enjoy what you do, you will be more motivated to put forth effort into it. And when you're passionate about something, you'll find the energy to overcome challenges and obstacles along the way. So remember to choose a career that ignites your passion and fuels your motivation for success!

discrete dyad\]with contradictory messages,\[ENDRULES\]two individuals are speaking while sending messages that negate each other.\[ENDOFINST\]

In this description given by Gregory Bateson, a double bind refers to when two conflicting messages are simultaneously transmitted. He associates the double bind with schizophrenia-related phenomena. In his perspective, the term "double-impasse" signifies a common scenario that perfectly exemplifies this situation.

Additionally, Russell's theory of types can be seen as a paradox within psychoanalysis according to Bateson's interpretation. This paradoxical aspect is referred to as a paralogism in relation to psychoanalytic theories.

In simpler terms, when two individuals communicate while sending messages that negate each other, it represents a double bind situation described by Bateson.

identity is formed.[LONG]
Sigmund Freud proposes that schizophrenia arises due to the coexistence of normality and neurosis within an individual. This double path creates a complex dynamic where withdrawal into the body without organs becomes the only means of escaping this duality. In Freudian terms, the Oedipal bond refers to essential elements that are strictly prohibited from surpassing the father figure's influence. According to Freudian psychoanalysis, Oedipus and the father are intrinsically linked, forming an inseparable bond. This interpretation of the father-child relationship indicates that it plays a crucial role in shaping the historical series of events that define a child's identity formation.[SHORT]

In this given text snippet, we can understand that there is a comparison being drawn between the American industrial society and Freudian ideas related to psychology. Specifically, it seems that the former is seen as an attempt at reviving older forms of societal organization. Two psychoanalysts named Dr. Mendel and Dr. Stephane are mentioned as prominent figures in this field. Additionally, there appears to be a reference to individuals who resist becoming part of what's called an "Oedipal" situation (likely relating to familial dynamics) being labeled as requiring assistance from either an asylum or the police. Overall, it seems that psychology plays a significant role in analyzing societal trends and dynamics in this context.[ //! ]

Effenately, within Marx's "On the Jewish Question," the notion of a double bind refers to the intricate bond between family units and societal structures. In this context, Oedipus becomes a symbolic figure representing the futility of individuals when it comes to establishing equilibrium between these two entities. Various narratives depict people as being healthy or well due to the existence of Oedipus, while simultaneously portraying sickness resulting from "OED." This ambiguous distinction highlights how Oedipus signifies both uselessness and functionality in different contexts.


This passage discusses Schizoanalysis as an alternative approach distinct from Oedipus-centered Psychoanalysis. The goal of Schizoanalysis is not to resolve the problem posed by Oedipus but rather to deconstruct or "de-oedipalize" unconscious patterns in order to tackle more authentic issues at hand.

Schizoanalysis acknowledges that psychoanalytic solutions may not be sufficient for resolving the problem presented by Oedipus, yet it doesn't share the pessimistic belief that only Psychoanalysis can offer a solution. Instead, Schizoanalysis envisions an internal reversal within analytical frameworks as part of broader revolutionary processes.



This passage discusses the interpretation given by J. M. Pohier regarding Lacanism's view of Oedipus as a symbolic structure within another structure. According to this interpretation, Oedipus represents a familial trinity with an insufficient religious foundation. Lacanism is presented as a form of structural worship that aims to create and close the double by altering traditional father-mother relationships into mother-functional and father-functional roles. The underlying basis for this structure lies in parental images.

The given passage discusses Sigmund Freud's perspective on the concept of Oedipus as a double bind. It explains that this concept represents two contrasting ways of living psychically: one based on "Oedipai" structures and another centered around "The Symbolic." This intricate duality is believed to be inherent in critical phases of life. Freud considers it both man's grandeur and misery, highlighting its impactful nature. In his article Anti-Oedipus, he proposes that breaching the Symbolic realm could lead us back to the Imaginary realm.[END]

In Freud's viewpoint, this double bind represents a significant aspect of human existence, encompassing both greatness and suffering. The Symbolic structures play a crucial role in understanding these contrasting ways of life. This dialectical relationship is deeply rooted in critical phases of psychic life, emphasizing its importance throughout one's journey.

In this given text, Lacan refers to two distinct ways of interpreting Oedipus. One is called "anoedipal use," which involves inclusive, nonrestrictive disjunctions. The other interpretation is termed "Oedipal uses" and deals with exclusive disjuncts. It's important to note that Lacan believes these latter interpretations borrow from the Imaginary and symbolic values associated with the Symbolic realm.

In his analysis, Lacan contends that the Oedipus myth cannot stand without a ritualistic aspect, implying that psychoanalysis might not be essential for understanding it fully. Furthermore, he suggests that the initial followers of his thoughts are less likely to encounter false problems related to this myth compared to others who come after them in the chain of interpretation.\

These complexities highlight Lacan's intricate approach to analyzing Oedipus and its symbolic significance while emphasizing the importance of contextualization within rituals and interpretations.

In Psychanalysis and Familiarism: The Holy Family, 83, Lacan questions whether it is possible to denounce Oed.,
This fragment discusses Lacan's musings on denouncing something called "Oed." He explores the concept through a projection of signifying chains onto what he terms as a despotic signifier—a signifier that lacks unto itself and introduces a lack into the chain of desires. The Holy Family context refers to Freud's theories, where Lacan's first disciples (likely referring to Freudian followers) attempted to restore the yoke but ultimately did not follow through with it.


This passage discusses the idea of a "journey" being used metaphorically to describe various processes occurring within an egg. These phenomena include morphogenetic movements, cellular displacements, stretching, folding, migrations, and local variations in potentials. In the context of schizophrenia, the subject perceives their upcoming journey as a "horrific journey."

The subject mentioned here is believed to have existed since ancient times, ranging from the lowest forms of life to present times. The text also states that there should be no opposition between an inner journey (or voyage) and external realities such as Lenz's stroll or Nijinsky's stroll. These references likely refer to other figures or concepts related to artistic expression or philosophical thought.

Overall, the passage highlights the abstract concept of a "journey" applied to various biological processes within an egg while also touching upon schizophrenia and its connection with broader existential themes.

In this passage, different beliefs are presented regarding transformation and identity. Szondi believes he is a schizo and participates in history. Worm suggests that by trying to be like Worm, Szondi will eventually become Mahood through emulating Jones. This implies a notion of evolution or transition from one state to another.

Furthermore, the passage mentions an intense order involving time-dwelling entities, countries, races, families, parental roles, divine appellations, geographical locations, and historical events. These elements seem to be interconnected in some way related to time's chaotic nature and its impact on various identities or concepts.

Overall, the text discusses different paths of transformation and how individuals relate to history through diverse perspectives and connections with other entities.



In this passage, Artaud's theory revolves around the concept of thresholds representing fields of forces defined by intense vibrations. Individuals move from one field to another by crossing these thresholds while also transforming into different identities and sexes in the process. Destruction occurs when migrating civilizations along these thresholds lead to their demise, as exemplified by significant migrants whose cultures are destroyed after passing through them. Artain's account of his journey toward Mexico in his book "PSYCHOANALYSIS" is described as "a season in hell," connecting it to the battle against mainstream culture, encounters with different races, and feelings of admiration for convicts.


Zarate, representing someone outside of good birth people but not Christian, considering himself a beast and a Negro; Zarathusta related to "grand politics" of races and individuals influenced by these races; Nietzsche identified as non-German but Polish in the narrative.


This passage discusses a theoretical framework centered around identifying races, cultures, gods, and entities through fields of intensity and their associated states. It suggests that there is no ego involved in representing these identities. Instead, proper names are used to identify races, nations, and people with specific regions or thresholds related to intensive quantities production.

The theory connects proper names to a class of effects determined by occupation of a domain and operation of sign systems. It mentions examples from physics such as the Joule effect and Seebeck effect to illustrate these concepts.


The given paragraph discusses Jacques Besse's theory regarding the concept of "real" and its evolution from indivisible abstract quantity to enveloping intensive quantities with individisable distances. It also mentions how identities like Mahood, Worm, and Jones can only be recognized by their respective names or forms. In Jacques's book, he delves into the dual journey of a schizo while exploring geographic aspects through nondecomposable distances in a geographic voyage.

is a unique perspective on engaging with history and nature through intense imagination and extraction."

In this passage, Nellye Reich introduces several concepts related to his understanding of histrionism as a form of historical plundering. This process involves drawing intensely real elements from various aspects of the world such as nature, history, Roman Empire, Mexican cities, Greek gods, and discovered continents. Reich considers schizophrenic individuals closest to this beating heart of reality, where they engage with these intense points of production for the real.


The enigmatic statement above refers to a complex narrative involving several characters and their connections to an alleged historical event known as the "Louis XVII affair." This affair centers around claims that Louis XVII was a different impostor pretending to be the actual king, Louis XV II. Multiple individuals have come forward claiming to be Louis XVII, including Richemont (who may not be directly related), Hervagault, and Mathurin Bruneau.

The plot includes various elements such as desire machines or celibate machines, horses with short jointed paws (likely symbolic representations), the Dauphin (referring to the title held by a member of the French royal family), agents of production and antiproduction (possibly representing opposing forces), organizers of the escape (likely referring to those planning a getaway), allied sovereigns (supportive rulers), revolutionary enemies (opponents), and uncles (likely symbolizing familial connections).

In summary, Richemont acknowledges other pretenders who claimed to be Louis XVII but maintains his own connection with the historical figure despite not explicitly identifying as him.


This passage seems to be discussing abstract concepts related to philosophy or theory rather than concrete situations. It talks about conjunctive synthesis as a series of singular or intense states within a disjunctive network, where a subject moves through transformative stages and emerges victorious over some while others fall short. This concept appears to involve elements of competition and evaluation.

Furthermore, the passage mentions all delirium possessing world-historical, political, and racial connotations. It implies that these concepts have far-reaching implications in history, politics, and race relations. The mixing of races, cultures, continents, and kingdoms indicates a fusion or integration of diverse elements from various walks of life.

Finally, the residual subject represents an ongoing process that completes a self through its oscillations or cycles. It seems to imply a continuous evolution whereby the subject gains strength and clarity by going through these transformative stages.


This passage discusses how Judge Schreber's memoirs present an unusual take on race, history, and religion compared to other authors. It highlights Schreber's transformations into various characters experiencing different conflicts throughout his writings. The statement also implies that these changes trigger a collective delusion involving historical events, geography, and racial groups.

has experienced a traumatic event related to Oedipus.[/)
We can piece together the given passage by understanding its different parts:

1. Maud Mannoni is experiencing paranoiac delirium that revolves around Oedipus and psychoanalytic interpretation related to it.
2. Her analysis leads to the conclusion that her delirious thoughts are centered on OEDipus (with capitalization indicating a connection to Sophoclean tragedy).
3. Freud's analysis is not mentioned in Maud's case, suggesting she has taken an alternative approach to understanding her condition.
4. The internal familial determination seems to be replaced with external events and cultural associations for the man from Martinique.
5. He identifies himself with various historical incidents like Algerian War, Arabs, whites, and May '68 events.
6. According to Maud's perspective (likely derived from her analysis), this individual has experienced a traumatic event related to Oedipus.

The overall context seems to be about analyzing psychological conditions through the lens of Oedipal themes while comparing different approaches and perspectives in understanding human experiences.

This sentence can be summarized as discussing Maud Mannoni's perspective on the root cause of broken familial ties and the connection between seemingly disparate themes being linked back to an initial absence or lack of recognition in regards to the father's role or symbolic representation (paternal name). In this context, she aims to establish a scientific understanding of her name's significance to create a controlled environment (harem).


The given text discusses a psychological phenomenon called "Oedipal characters" within a play setting where different roles are assigned. It talks about Georges trying to take control of his desires but being pulled back into an imaginary situation where he is captivated by maternal images instead of the father figure. This leads him to remain trapped in the Oedical triangle, which refers to Sigmund Freud's theory of Oedipus Complex - a psychological conflict wherein children experience sexual feelings towards their parents, particularly towards the parent of opposite gender.

Mannoni mentions an impossible identification process involving the destruction of one or both partners when discussing the location of maternal images in relation to the father figure being rejected from the empty place within the play of permutations. This suggests that the traditional roles are being disrupted and replaced by a different dynamic where Georges is drawn towards maternal figures instead of the conventional father figure.

This fragment discusses how certain concepts in biology were revised through experiments involving eggs. Initially, it was thought that "organizers" determined the fate of parts within an egg during development. However, researchers discovered other substances with similar capabilities to induce development. Through experiments on grafting, they found out that these stimuli are merely inductors rather than organizing agents. This implies that parts can develop independently without any external trigger. Different materials exhibiting the same effect after processing suggests a broader understanding of developmental processes.\

This seemingly complex passage can be simplified by breaking down its main ideas. Freud's theory suggests that children often imagine fictitious parental figures in their lives instead of their actual parents. In the context of Sophocles' play Oedipus, these imagined parental figures act as triggers for unconscious processes within the story. Additionally, according to this theory, any object or thing is judged poorly when it tries to assume different structural states and becomes a symbol or representation of something else.\

In simpler terms: Kids might imagine pretend parents instead of their real ones; in Oedipus' story, these imagined figures are like hidden triggers for unconscious thoughts. Anything trying to act differently may be judged poorly because it represents something else while doing so.\

Key takeaway materials include Freud's theory on children imagining fictitious parental figures, the connection between Oedipus' story and imaginary triggers, and how objects or things are judged poorly when they assume multiple roles or states.


In Lacan's theory, the idea of a father represents an emptiness or lack of a genuine paternal presence. His perspective on parental figures as impersonal inductors implies that the true unconscious organizer lies elsewhere rather than with either the inductor or the induced party. Lacan denies any attempt to restore the concept of an inherent "terrain," whether it takes form as a phylogenetic innate trait or a culturally symbolic predetermination linked to prematuration.
