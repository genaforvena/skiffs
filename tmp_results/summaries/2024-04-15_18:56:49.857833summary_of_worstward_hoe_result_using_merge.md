The sound of a heartbeat coming up.

But, the sound of people in their car.

And, they stopped.

No.

They wouldn't give it a thought.

Only to be swallowed in it's own vomit.

I would die to them.

The sound of their hands on the dashboard.

But, and the screams coming.

And the screams coming..

But the scream.

And, a few more, a few more. A little longer.

A little longer..

The scream.

And there it was.

I had given it the thought, and now it felt...

Good.

It was good.

And I was just happy to be done.

I wouldn't

It's been a month since you saw me and that's a long time for someone who loves you so much to just go to sleep.

"We are now on the train to the next big city," you say and you don't have to feel any more sorry for yourself - you are free.

You are always free - when your thoughts of your thoughts keep their distance from the idea that you are free.

When you make the journey here, keep your mind free.

You don't have to think about how beautiful you are. You don't have to remember that you need to get the rest of the way. You don't have to think about what's in front of you, but just keep your mind free to remember your thoughts about you.

To be free means not having to think.


If the thought be all to be up, the way it lay there lies down for to stay.

(It's like being in school or work. Not having to think about what is the most important - which you can already do but which you don't realize to be true).


To be free means being able to be in the present.

You are free to

It's quite easy to see the changes. What's even more interesting for me is how the whole thing takes place in a sort of weird twilight of self-discovery/recovery/self-awareness. This kind of thing happens to all of us. Not as acutely as a patient with cancer with the right kind of treatment, who turns out to be a total fucking mess. Yes, I know, maybe you could have some cancer treatments which are so much better that you don't even realize you have cancer. Maybe you have something like a tumour that can just be managed, and so you just get treated by what people who don't have it call "surgical precision" instead of real expertise. The difference is, though, that you do actually have to deal with the result of that medical judgement. All the rest of its consequences: that it's now a lump of cancer, and so you need a massive surgical operation done - if you choose an

There are enough time in the middle of summer to wait for the end of the Devil - but, wait a minute, just a minute a minute.


The only way to say hello to your sweetheart in heaven is to offer you a hug, maybe give it one or two. It'll be even sweeter when we finally meet our good friend.


But how? You've come to me already. No one to hear it.

And then we were coming across a lot and the white lights just stopped on top of the trees and just sort of faded out the little white lights just faded out in white darkness out in the back and we just stopped out in the back in the dark. And we thought if we stopped to check if there was anybody there and there weren't any nobody or not only nobody but the house were black in both light and dark.

And we ran down the street to the next street and I got our dog and we ran and we ran and I said dog I just

A few times I'm feeling ill... maybe because of an impending stroke...maybe because of an attack...maybe because of the fact that I can't seem to go to the computer because it's all too painful and I was just sitting at the computer for like, a month and a half... maybe because I'm being an obnoxious ass, a self-obsessed, selfish bitch... and that's just the tip of the iceberg.


Every once in a while some sort of physical experience happens and at first I don't know how to explain it...I'm in this weird place in my head where I'm looking at a computer screen and they show a cartoon frog and... some strange creature, looking just like an octopus. And one day, like 10 years ago, some awful person (probably a serial killer) comes and bites me, almost right in front of my eyes...I can't describe how I feel or what came over me or how I feel as the next day goes by, but I tell you what, I'm not going to put any of it down.

"You don't have to go for the 'A' grade until you understand the meaning of the word."


"Failing grades were not merely poor. In many cases the grades were so low that they could not possibly have been worth the effort." "A lot can be learned by working on grades in classes or even by reading some of the work of those whom we call the first-wave critics. "


So all the students who don't pass may not actually fail if we make them fail in class, or take some other disciplinary action. They simply won't do well until they understand what that means. Then they can fail less.

As for that part you left out.. I'm pretty sure the "A'' grade means the student has failed. Unless the student was on a course with lots of failures..

I would guess that most of what she said is true, except for the part about failing or failing very badly.


Perhaps a student may have passed a final exam in the first year and then been absent for part of the second year, then returned to school, and the failing "A� grade or failing well were somehow a part of the teacher's explanation or explanation was simply a way to make the student more compliant in class, rather than the teacher being right?


In any case, I can't help thinking the "fail-and-learn" ethos would lead such students to be

"I've found him! I found him, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. He's here with me. I wonder what we can do," it was the old man who had brought the boy to the cabin, which was no longer quite at the head of the valley. It was the day, but the sky was a cloudless blue. Even though one could not see to see where one was, one was sure that there a man and boy lying in the dark waiting there. The old man's long, thick hair was wavy, and he was wearing a ragged green jacket.


"I know him, too, you know," said the boy. "I have been here the last few weeks. Not in a cabin with no one to talk to, of course, but in that old cabin over there the last few days. It's not exactly a house--I mean, it isn't the kind with a big barn, but it is pretty old. And if I can find him again, I can talk to him and he'll tell me who sent you."

Letting one of those things in and your thoughts.That was just nothingness!It's merely nothingness!

Excerpt as prose from Chapter 16 of Chapter 24, by Joseph Campbell


The above extracts, including those on page 28 of Chapter 26, represent the final version of the original manuscript of John, which was compiled in 1874 and published in 1887. See, for example, Joseph E. Rains & Michael K. Wahlberg, Ancient Myth and History: A Textual Analysis of the Gospel of John, revised edition (Chicago: Moody Press, 1994) as well as William D. Smith, John's Gospel and the Myth of the Eternal Trinity (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982).


In the original manuscript manuscript of John the Divine, the first of its kind, it is the title of the first chapter (the 1) and the first paragraph (the 2) that are of note for what it describes. The latter is:


THE GODHEAD


THE ETERNAL TURNABUL AND THE GODHEAD


Ether is not divisible into more parts, nor less parts, nor any other than into five. In this it is equal to that which is the essence and self-same, as I have shown in the first chapter, I have not explained.

(Songs about the Old Man and the New Man by Cevzur)


There is something you can do now to make it last.It's very difficult for us.I think perhaps it's because there is such a great power in all these old things now.


When I think about it, there is not so much power here to stop the present.In all those things that I had to do,I did not know about or want to know.


I did not know all these things, because I have seen them.I did not understand them before, but here they are.Here are they now.They cannot remain here with us forever.What we might have hoped to do, or hoped to understand, I did not have or have yet, just like you do not have a thought of wanting someone else to go where you are to take the place you have and give you what you have.All this thinking of people walking on the road and so many things that had to be told, just by thinking about walking on roads, just to be here that we may have some meaning to life and no further to find it.All those things, they have all vanished along with the time that we are

I had just completed the final chapter of The Book of Unwritten Tales when she died.


And then I cried out to the unknown god and he was there and He said "The future you desired is here now and you will make it. But it will not be easy." And then I fell in the deepest night where it felt as though my heart were broken into a thousand pieces and as my body broke, I saw that it was as it had been before and so that day was a miracle.

On the evening of the eighth night of the first or last month of the year, there was a little house in the east, the sun had sunk in the east, and there was a little lamp.

The little house was one of those that is built of stucco. The walls are of the same stucco, but there are two different types; one is like that which is made of the blue of a sky and the green of grass and shrubs; and it's kind of a sort of blue brick brick, and the other kind is like a green, well-wooded brick with a white top and a top on top, which is green brick, and it's very pretty. The lower part is stone, so there are two stucco blocks, one a little smaller than the other, which is the stucco of the outside and the kind that goes in the st

I've done it in the name of life.In the name of the child.I believe in this child so much.So much more I believe.So much more in the name of love.

A voice within a wall is saying "no" to an outside voice, a voice that says "yes"? A voice within a wall. This is not the same voice, though, that's just some noise. The wall needs to be put down and the person inside needs to be forgiven the noise is noise. It's part of the whole mess. There are a lot of people inside of Wall Street today and inside Wall Street in its last days as an institution that it really matters. A lot

Carnage

This subtheme is an homage to the theme of The Witcher, so "You are here" in this phrase refers to your existence, and "you're here" to what you wish to escape at all costs, but the theme itself is really not to the hero, except to you as a character. In the game, if you die, you are still alive, but the player does not die, only the player's avatar (and so on) can see you, but this is more to do with you being "dead" and the narrative having taken place as you were. That being said, if you die at the end of a long game of this subtheme, then you can't die at all. You simply die and die.

You can only fight one level at a time, which means that if anyone fights you are almost always dead. For a character to defeat you before the end, there are a few things you can do, but these are only necessary upon killing her.

The main fact that if you die during your first battle, that's because you've died because the game started. To get into this phase of the game, kill a bit of enemies, or kill a boss.

If you don't kill the enemy's boss in the event of death, then you can use a different power to attack, such

 
To be free means to be alive

I cannot be free - I can't be human.

I can't be human - I cannot be a human.

But, once free,


I can't be alive.

I can be alive. I can be alive - I am free.

(I can be alive without knowing it). I am free. I am free.  I am free.  I am free.

And that is the truth. 

So be real when it comes to the future.

Free thinking about free doing.

(A free attitude is not someone who is a free will).

You are free to your own dreams.

The past has been a gift to you.

You only have to pay the price for the past.

You have more freedom in the past compared to the present - to the past life, no, or today.


Free thinking about free doing isn't so much about the present,


it actually is the future. One thing that freedom does was to put yourself in the future to see what it must be like - a little way ahead of you.

So instead of having to think about your situation and what's ahead, remember that for a moment.


And be the free human mind.

So that you can dream,


be there in the future,


be the free human mind

so you can be living life free today, and free tomorrow, and free the future,




 
I don't want any more details or explanations of why this shit is happening to me and why you need to go, but I will just add this bit: a real life person (a "real person") was once an experienced surgeon. He was very intelligent about it, and he got his ass kicked with "the science" - as the surgeon described it. There was some huge "cure" in him for an accident with the first machine he went into, this was one of those things I can feel is in my DNA. After that surgery you saw the symptoms (and some signs) which are most definitely real. The real thing happens to you. As far as being able to handle your own cancer, it's usually the one who does the actual work, the one who has to try and get the most serious thing for you. In the case of my other, and hopefully most tragic case (for them) being the one to lose his mind, I didn't have much of a doctorate in this field, so I spent a lot of my time in college, just trying to do what the medical profession should do.


Now, how long does it really take to "fix" me? There was even talk of how I should "try to be more of an asshole" so I stopped caring about things like how badly I needed to be changed, how long it would take for a good job to get, or that I was on drugs that made me more susceptible to things like depression. As someone who has been dealing with anxiety and stress for long enough, it really comes down to how

Darkness is quite possibly the worst piece of work that I have ever done. He has just a few lines in and is ruined. There are no other options to take with him.


My favourite part of the book is also completely useless, as is most of the book itself. We have one character who talks while being eaten by a dragon, his first words are "I am nothing." When it comes to how it ends, it was a let down on me again. I am happy he makes his sacrifice, but was left feeling somewhat empty, no doubt about it.

This is the meaning which appears in the first two letters (B and I) of the alphabet: the 'gods' are always united with the living dead (in their souls and bodies, but not beyond). "

Euthynesis

In the Euthynemesis myth, each of the gods and goddesses comes into being from the head of Euthyphro, a god and a virgin. Each of them possesses a soul, with a soul that becomes the mortal woman Enoch. Euthyphro is married. God, in the divine name, brings all of them into being - they are the divine mother goddesses of humankind (the Euthyphro family tree). Euthyphro, then, (which is actually three gods and three goddesses) transforms Eve into Eve on the day that the Adam-God was brought into being.

[Laughter]


I just got a black dog, you think maybe my friend and I were just out here looking around and he had come back to us and he was like, I've got a house blackin here and I forgot what it looked like and I said that I just got a baby and black too and it said, That's it I don't know.

So they called fire and the fire department came down and said, We've gotten the lady in the house. Come on put her in the hospital and take care of her. And he brought two other people down on his front porch and they were putting everything together and we went in and we brought the baby away. But when the firemen got there there was the two lady people in the dark bedroom with the black little black dog inside their arms that's who told us the whole story because we ran down the street and ran around the house and ran and covered the whole neighborhood with fire and they had some more firemen all the way all the way up the hill. And the firemen was over so we were looking for any things we could put to bed now that they hadn't seen yet. And everything fell to the ground in the back.

What we heard the fireman say they can't understand you and so everything he said were you heard us from the ground.

I am a computer geek, writer, producer, musician, and I've spent the last 10 years working for a major game developers company in New York City, one of the biggest in the world, based in the city of New York, as well as a couple other major games companies in the nation. I've started making art with my life and then doing some real work for my hobby... working for an artists studio for a while (which eventually ended up just coming up with music which I really enjoyed) and also for some odd time, because... just to make things a bit simpler for the average gamer there were also some really nice people out there, really hard working artists, real like-minded people who cared and tried hard to achieve whatever you want to achieve. Basically I wanted to be a really nice guy, you know? So in that sense I thought to myself, "Well all of a sudden somebody else will come to my studio, and maybe you'll come along too?

a failure that would not be made public unless the students showed strong resistance to it

a failure that it would be impossible to fix by simply putting up a sign saying what the "A� grade said and what it did not

But the thing is, the way school is set up -- for all the efforts it takes to educate people in science, mathematics, history, literature, the arts and the sciences -- when it's all said and done, failing can still be remedied by getting an exam; and I'm sure that a significant number of test takers in the early

Do I have to know, how must I know what I have seen?)


The way the night must be dark.The way the darkness must be light.The way the night must be lonely.The way the darkness must be empty.The way that the darkness is empty. The way that the lonely soul has fallen from

the darkness, and the light is filled with darkness from out,

What I see is how far I go.How far I may go.If they lie still.Where the night is

dark, I will see no thing.I come to look for more.Where the day is

those two souls I once knew will turn back

to darkness.

"You say what you think about her, but I suppose those were my thoughts as children, but as babies? Because you can't be stupid if you think that. I had a son that couldn't get a hand up my skirts or put up with someone else's problems. So I could be, uh, with no reason to, no purpose. But it was all just one more thought. I've become...so...much more.And I believe this to be true, I suppose, given to me as a child. As a man. Because...you don't get what's called a man. Even if you can live in a society that doesn't allow for it. You get it. I don't get it from you."

"Well? What was it? The night before? The day? He died of a mysterious ailment last that night at the cabin."


He shook his head. "He did not live to see us. There were many other people who knew me at the time at the same time. I could not have left his grave, though, for it was so near to the place I have now just now got lost. The little thing always got its name here, and I don't know if I can know it with any certainty. The boy had his own little secret."


"What secret?" cried the old man, who was now standing, now looking as if he had seen some sort of cat from another dimension, without any thought at all of what to look for.


"I don't know that, really," she said; and then she said:


"Oh, you know what we think of the boys. I'm sure they are really sad people, and don't want to get into the life of this town because they're afraid that they'll meet us and have to go to court and go face to face with me and have all those others to be put down." And then she said:


"And the little thing would know, too, the name of this little lady. The girl you call her. I'll always have her. I always think of her, when I'm done talking. She's always waiting. She was your daughter for so long, and she never came to see we."


A deep sigh escaped her mouth as

[Nadezhda's statement that "I'm just talking about those", as in "Don't worry about where they are. They'll have to find a new road somewhere." would be consistent with Matisse's remark, "That's not an error." The "new road" is the one which doesn't lead to nowhere, to the past

 If this description is accurate, it means that the Godhead as a whole does not differ with respect to any single feature, except perhaps in the degree of a material part (at least, in the sense of materialness). The material part is the whole. It has a name, which should be obvious to anyone who has studied Greek grammar, called a subject. Its proper subject is Godhead. Of itself, it has no essence. Its proper essence is "God." There is no one part of the divine essence that is not an element in the Godhead."

In sum, it is difficult to imagine a higher degree in which any feature on the divine substance is not an element in the Godhead. This is how John's description of the Godhead would have to have been interpreted by his early readers, if the original manuscript of John was to be regarded as a "fictional."


In addition, and especially during the period of John's conversion, it became possible to see the importance of language more clearly by studying Greek grammar instead of simply counting up the possible meanings of words. For instance, in the early manuscripts of John there are two different verbs for "to be." In Matthew we have "be" (as the noun), and in John there are words such as "beseen," "beheld," "held," etc. The first of these words is in the verb form, and the second form is in the participle form (the participle being a verbal noun or verb, rather than an adjective). The reason is that these two forms refer to the same thing:

We need a new beginning to live.


For all the joy we see in life, it is a dream, no more.


Here at this moment, I am sure that this change is what I have to do with this moment.

The words above are my personal recollections. To express my opinion about them is not to say that I am in any way an individual in any way. They may not be for any particular person, but to express them in a very general way is to reveal that I am different from other people. I have changed people. I hope to become the same.In our times, I have lost the feeling of belonging. The feeling that it is very hard to belong, for all these things that I had to do to live. In many other places, and I am trying to do that just now, there have been people who have changed and not really belonged, but I would say that many a time.I am still not that different now. I am still pretty good-looking, not as great as when we were before but whooping in our ears.

You are right about the very fact that there has not been time that we have experienced in this period this.

In any case, this change is still a dream.


I think that our time has passed a couple of hundred and thirty years ago. And now that we are all living that wonderful way now, the other side of it is not quite right.

There had been a lot of thinking in it from the beginning, and I had no idea at

 
Inasmuch as the first says not of men, but of God, what is the second.

Here are the three terms that are most apt to prove and bear testimony to the truth:

The meaning of all these terms is that if the word "flesh" and all its derivatives are added to the word "mind," "spirit," and any one of the words (say "possession"), there is no difference in the meaning of the two terms—unless both mean to mean to become a being, or become a being.

The meaning of the "modes" at the beginning of the second phrase is that which is the first.

The meaning of the "mind" in the first phrase is that which is the second.

If the first phrase as taken by both is followed by one or more terms (to be changed or changed), there is no difference in the meaning of the two phrases.

All and all of the preceding ten-countries are found in this sentence to have the word of man, and all and all of the following ten-countries are found also in this sentence to have the word of mind:


The word "mind" in the first phrase means that which is the second, and also means that which is the first.


As said above, nothing in these ten nations is better than nothing.

All nations are found in these twelve words to have the word.


The word in these twelve words is that which is the first, but not of men. As for the first, "flesh

"I need to stay sane now. It's not easy keeping an open mind in my condition."

– Ayn Rand:

One hundred years ago my husband died in WWII. In addition to everything, the event also destroyed my life. The only things I possess in the afterlife are his novels and his letters. I will never see my children or even tell them about the war. After I have died, my husband's literary legacy is now mine. Only with the passage of time will he appear in my memory as well and will I be able to say something at least meaningful about the past. I will spend the remainder of my life with an empty heart. But I will have no regrets. It is not my fault that he didn't become a good writer or become a better husband, which of course he had plenty of time to do. I am still alive. But I have to forget. There can be more?

"Life is, in general, a gift from the universe. It is not free. Life happens, and, if one is fortunate, it can be beautiful, and a great number of lives can be better for it than the other. But life never comes for free."

"One thing I'm certain of: You are the life you've always had. And so is the rest of this universe. No matter how many lives one has, one will always be the same person that comes before, the same person that comes after. Your story has just begun. Be the thing you always were. And have it always been."

"I'm a person who, like a clock, counts to infinity and only a moment ago stopped ticking. If I don't like a person enough to change them, I can easily change the universe around me. This may seem a little strange, but it doesn't matter. I do what I must to keep my peace."

The time comes for all these souls to wake and come forth from the dead. And they do—this time, after the death of the past of one of Irenaeus—with a voice that is not just like an arm, but like a person. He speaks the truth: he opens his body to speak, and this time he says to them to follow him:

"When I take your hand and speak, with one hand, you shall speak with me not only in my heart but in my soul.

Because when I say I will make my soul open to speak in my heart, you must follow me there.

And when I speak with you then I will walk with you and you shall have a new voice.

But when I speak with you and speak with you and speak with YOU.

And if I say and what you say and where you are not also true.

Then I shall be glad to see you, and you shall follow me.

You shall have a new voice."​

I will be in love with that voice.

I will be happy to meet you.

So I have chosen to share with you the gospel of the one who speaks.

So I have chosen a spirit that, too, I want to share with you, just as I want you to share.

Just as she was born I noticed I began to hear the "choke sound" that accompanied her breathing and knew I had to find her. There was so many strange sounds during her life, so many things she wanted that my brain still did not understand. I had one brother named George. He came from a very influential family in Louisiana and he had no idea. He went on to be one of the most powerful and influential men of all time. And when my friend, the famous author of the classic children's book "The Book of Unwritten Tales", was told he died in a mysterious plane crash to his wife, as she walked away from a lecture and her eyes were closed. All my research revealed they had a terrible tragedy and there was no known explanation.


And yet.


I couldn't do anything. I could not do anything. It's just the rules. Nothing happens so the only thing that can happen is we have to move forward.


All in all, I left with a blank page.


But I am glad I did.


In an effort to find the way. I found the answer.


The Book of Unwritten Tales is now an annual collection of stories from over 300 years. In the early editions of a few years ago it was the No.1 story in books in children's and family oriented book stores in the USA.


I had started with the story of how I learned about Schizopychogy from my late uncle, the author of the famed children's book, "The Book of Unwritten Tales".

china. There are two types of the stucco blocks; one kind is a stone, and the other is very, very well-wooded brick. In the middle of that stone block is a little sloping area with two openings in it, in a small, narrow part just inside of the middle of the sloping area. This is the stone inside. The wall is very dark gray. If you do not move the stone block a little, it will be light gray. But what you do not do is to lift the stone block off the wall, because this is an evil thing. The stone block must not be lifted, or you will have to leave your house. You have no choice.

The lamp is not the kind that can be turned on and off. No, the lamp is a little lamp with three or four spindles that you put in the end of the lamp and can turn on and off. To the left side of the lamp there are three places on the wall, where it is arranged in a kind of three pieces, one side is white and one side is black. A little spindle with a wire on the end in it is connected to the white side and the black side. When you put this wire in the end and turn it on, it will glow for a period. The black side is on fire, and if you do this to the white side, the whole wall of the room will burn up.

When you want to put something in there, it is good to leave it on longer than usual

 
Here now is the truth, the fact that Wall Street has gotten so big that it may have become a whole another society again. All in the name of that which has been built in the name of the one, the only. You'll never find there so many people in there and yet they all talk like they're the same. That's the world they have created.

Let the wall fall! There's no stopping you, no fighting you! You have no need to break into a storehouse or another place, or go out on the street, don't fight on the sidewalk, they'll take you away from it, they will take from Wall Street everything it holds for it's people, I will not let anybody take your money, my people. A new beginning is dawning on Wall Street! In the name of the love of the boy on the other side.In the name of the baby. A new beginning is dawning. You'll never get far from me until Wall Street finally breaks, is destroyed. I can't stop you. I'll always do everything all within my power to make you happy. It's easy to find people that look alike to Wall Street but Wall Street has you confused in its hearts!

When we are all in the darkness, our darkest, darkest, darkest, we have to do something together, to build a movement. To raise the awareness. We have to speak out and make the people realize what they are losing out on and what they're being betrayed into!

Do you know the price we paid when we lost the freedom back in the Civil Rights Act of

The idea is to get back to the first level, save it during the main storyline by killing it as a party member.

This is what happens when the game saves your saves files. If you've got a save to save in your saves folder, you can use that to open up the book, and use them as a party character. If you don't have a save to save in your save folder, then you can play the game without the save at all unless you decide to do this later. You will see this when you start.


In order to play in this stage, you must either be fighting a specific target (e.g., Geralt, the Wolf, the Boar) or a different target (e.g., the other way around).

If you play a very large campaign or don't have the necessary campaign save files, or if you use a special character.

This process is almost always performed by using a certain character, but this step is not fully complete unless you play this one in a large campaign. The basic order you should take a character out in a large campaign is as follows:

P. A. S. If you play this character to win, then do this for the entire campaign.

And so for a while, the only way to find a doctorate in neuroscience was to have a PhD. At that point, I spent a lot of time trying to not have any problem having a PhD, I spent plenty of time being able to be able to get a therapist, and for good reasons. You can see in all the pictures below one of my last jobs, who was to run the same lab. Here is how I ended up being the main person getting my PhD:In a way, it seemed like the best way to do this as an asshole was to make it easier for us doctors to figure out how to fix people like me.

All I'd do is work in an office with lots of people and only get that work done as fast as possible.I did have a lot of other things I wanted to do with my career, so it took a while to figure that one out.

The author says, "This book is not for the weak or the wimp". That is some pretty lame bullshit there. "The Dark Powers cannot help but find fault" has no bearing on whether or not this novel is a failure. They do have a point though.

Welp, this is it, if there is one or two more that is good I will write and post them here.

The 'I/Euthyphro', the goddesses, and the 'one' person, the Adam-God.

Euthyphro represents the divine power of Nature. As the divine power of Creation, which gives the world its shape, Euthyphro is the source of natural creation. Euthyphro, then, is one of Nature's great creators when one looks upon Nature: In the Euthyphro story, she brings the first people of the Earth into being and becomes their creator, through a process called 'emergence'. All of her creations have a soul of their own.


Euthyphro and the Euthyphro family tree

The idea of "the God of the World (that is to say of the universe) became human" is a theme which runs through the whole myth. "The people of the Earth were brought into being (emergently) from the hands of an undying One" (Gen. 1:26). The divine power of Nature is therefore united with a divine person whose being is eternal (although this does not mean that she is without death; she is the source of death). When Euthyphro first appears in the story, she is a virgin, although Euthyphro's daughters were conceived from the body of Euthyphro's wife Enoch.


"The divine being was created... the creator, the mother, and the mother being brought into being. These became the mother-goddesses of mankind (Euthyphro/Enoch/Euthyphoenis family tree)"

"Emanation"

Euthyphro is the primordial personification of God. Emanation is the way of becoming more powerful than you were before, and therefore is a "

 
So they put the black dog back and he came back out and he said, I have a baby black and my husband said, I know it's black because I saw it on the news but we can't tell you.

And he said, The only way we'll let you leave that house is if we put an end to all those black people.

And all of a sudden we heard the door open and everybody rushed outside but they couldn't see anything because they didn't know if we could get out of the house.

So it was chaos, everybody was yelling at the same time and everybody was jumping over in all directions, trying to get in and try to get us out of there. And that's when I had my big break.

I looked over at the little dog and said, We can't let you go yet because the man who does your laundry, the black guy at the gas station might have shot you but if he hasn't you can't get in now.

So we said, Fine. We'll go. And we left the area and I got to the fire house and they asked, How did you know about all this? So we said, We heard it all from the ground.

At some point, I would think as something weird started happening to me. Like I would have a bad dream about something, or like my whole life might break on me, or something like that. At some point a good man would come around to my studio and see what was wrong and maybe make the right decision and go on to make that one good decision in life or find some way to move forward regardless of anything. But at that point, you wouldn't ever know because I wouldn't be on that good guy level, because the man would probably have been trying to take me away or something. I just felt like at some point I was in some sort of strange dream or it was happening now because I wanted someone to come here and help me, and maybe this time things would work out somehow, or I would be okay, you know? Maybe after I was in that dream, at some point someone would be like "hey we noticed something weird happening to you, what are you doing? Are you okay, are you okay, are you okay?" That is, the Dream Time has started happening and no one can seem to tell you why. Like you know, you can't see it, you can't hear it, or sometimes you just can

 
Yes, I know. Of course people can fall into the trap of thinking they need a grade to make themselves understand things better. It happens all the time. But there are many ways through which learning can never be undone.


It all depends on whether you think one thing is a mistake and another is a "mistake." And not only are all mistakes errors, but all mistakes are mistakes nonetheless. And the more you know about something, the more likely you are to realize that one of it is just "doubt", whether it's a flaw or not.


So yes, you don't have to have an A to understand the meaning of "good" and "bad" -- and you certainly don't need an A to understand the meaning of "failure".


But what you do need to know is how to recognize the difference between "failure" and "success" or "failure-plus-success".


And if you don't recognize how this is all accomplished, then you won't ever learn, because it isn't.


Yes, failures are sometimes (not always) caused by circumstances. But, we must keep in mind, when it comes to learning, if we are to learn, we have to know the difference:


To fail is different from to succeed; and


To succeed is different from to fail.


That difference is made crystal clear throughout this story. This is where you get to understand that the difference between success and failure--between "success", "failure", and "no mistake"--is as black-and-white as the difference between "I get a raise and no one does and I

You might as well say those are my sentiments now

I'd like to know what that feels like to be rejected by a love that was always there.

I've made it my goal to be loved without rejection. And I see how that works out right now.

"Why? Because I'm no longer the romantic? I'm the romantic now?" you ask.

Is this what you call a nice idea? You like to love someone and when they reject you, what do you give in return? Is this what we can call a great romantic relationship? You're like those guys that say "I hate you, but that is MY love." They're not the romantic ones, and I don't want to be one either!

My story:


I was born a virgin in a village on the outskirts of

 
"It was that girl when you were still alive! The girl that is always watching your shoulder down by your face while I am talking, and then she comes up and whispers after me to look out for her, you know?"


So saying, she went round to her right and spoke suddenly to the old woman: "Oh, why, what did she look like?"


The woman looked, still smiling, at her husband with a very curious look in her eye.


"It's a little thing!" she said, with a grave, penetrating look; "and in the old days, it was just as if you could turn your head and take a glimpse of the girl before your eyes. But now they don't care. And she never was the same; she's gone, you've had her back."


She shook herself. "You really must see this woman."


The woman stood by and listened.


"And the child that has gone."


The old woman went forward, and said quickly.


"I suppose you know, then," she continued: "That every one of us had our own little family, and that even the girls and boys had to have two families

 
And so it goes. I'm glad you came back to my poem again, your head's full of music like a mountain being carved in stone.

I'm surprised at your tone. I've been thinking of you for three days, and the two of you have been talking a lot about something and you want to do it. I'm not sure how.


[Maid's "Dance of Tears" is "The Dance of Tears by J.S. Lewis (1909)."] What is great, but, you know, I mean to hear it about the song, the beautiful little melody in which it is laid, how it's done, just on the way back from the first party where everyone is dancing, you know, and you'll take a look at it, just thinking

 
"By the words of the wise men, the word beholdeth God, a being of power, and power of the Most High (John 10:44)" ["The word beholdeth God is a being of power, and power of the Most High. It is true that the holy Father, through God, hath been to the Father with wisdom, and by His will, hath made these words; but the words of the wise men, the saying that is in the book," John 10:36, 38, 39, 40]


This distinction seems so subtle when applied to the Greek language, that it hardly need be described. For instance, in his first two chapters in the gospels, Matthew and Luke, John speaks of God with adjectives only when he refers to a very special and special part or attribute of His Being. Here is a simple illustration of the meaning of these words:


And it came to pass by one writing among the rest, behold thy brother the Sadducees were writing the law in the book of his law; And they were writing for to make men afraid, and to have them to be wise: for they, and some of them also of the prophets, wrote the same,
