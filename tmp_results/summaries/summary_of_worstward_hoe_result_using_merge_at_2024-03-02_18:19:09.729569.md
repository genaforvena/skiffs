Listen up, you hear me? We're gonna be doing this the old-fashioned way, no fancy fancy. We're gonna keep it simple and to the point. We're gonna get it done and get it done right.

So, let's talk about that body, the one we're gonna be takin' out. We're gonna get it done, and we're gonna do it right. We're gonna make sure that it's done right, or we'll do it again and again until it's done right.

We're gonna start by takin' that body and plunking it down in a place where nobody's gonna see it. We're gonna make sure that it's hidden, so that nobody can find it.

Then, we're gonna start beatin' that body with our fists, until it's bruised and bloody. We're gonna keep beatin' until it's so bruised and bloody that it can't move anymore.

After that, we're gonna throw up and go, and we're gonna do it again and again until we're sick of it. We're gonna keep on throwin' up and go until we're so sick that we can't move anymore.

Then, we're gonna throw up and back that body again, and we're gonna do it until it's back in its original place. We're gonna keep on throwin' up and back until we're so sick that we can't move anymore.

Finally, we're gonna keep on beatin' that body with our fists until it's so bruised and bloody that it can't move anymore. We're gonna keep on beatin' until we're so bruised and bloody that we can't move anymore.

So, listen up, you hear me? We're gonna do this the old-fashioned way, and we're gonna do it right. We're gonna make sure that it's done right, or we'll do it again and again until it's done right.


The one who is old and the one who is child are the ones who are seen in the dim void.

Listen up, you maggots! Now the one, the twain, both. Fade back, then the one, the twain. Both, fade? No, the dim goes, the void disappears. Say yes, each time, the one stays unchanged. Somehow, it's always changing, but never truly gone. Until no, then the back changes. Somehow, it's always changing, but never truly gone. The dim and the void, they vanish and reappear, but they never go away completely.

Each time, the one stays unchanged, but the back changes. It's always changing, but never truly gone. The dim and the void, they vanish and reappear, but they never go away completely.

The one can go, the twain can go, but they can't go down. They can't go down, but they can never stay still. They're always moving, always changing, but they never stop.

So, you maggots, listen up! The one is forever kneeling, the other is forever standing. The one can rise, but only to its knees. The back is always turned, the head is always sunk, the eyes are always dim.

The void is always there, a constant reminder of what is lost. It's always there, a constant reminder of what is never coming.

So, you maggots, listen up! The one is the only one, the only one who can go. The twain are the shadows, the whispers in the dark. They are the emptiness, the nothingness.

Now, go, you maggots, and do as I say. Do as I tell you. Do it all for me. Do it all for the one. Do it all for the twain.

So, you hear? Not a single thing is wrong. One, two, three, and all are in order. Far from wrong, far far from wrong. The words themselves, they almost ring, but they never quite do. Inanity, they almost reach, but they never quite get there. The night is young, alas, but take heart. Or better, say still a watch of night alas to come. A rest of last watch to come. And take heart. First one, first try fail better one. Something there badly not wrong. Not that as it is, it's not bad. The face is bad, the hands are bad, the -.Enough is bad. Mere bad, way for worse. Pending worse still. Next try fail better two. The twain, bad as it is, as it is. Bad the no-First back on to three. Not yet to try worsen. Simply be there again. There in that head in that head. Clenched eyes clamped to it alone. Alone? No. Too to it too. The sunken skull, the crippled hands, the clenched staring eyes. Be that shade again, in that shade again. With the other shades, worsening shades. In the dim void. Next, how all at once. The worsened one, the worsening two. And what yet to worsen. To try to worsen. It self, the dim, the void. All at once in that stare. Clenched eyes clamped to all. Next two. From bad to worsen. Try worsen. From merely bad. Add -.Add? Never. The boots, better worse bootless, bare heels. Now the two right, now the two left. Left right left right on. Barefoot unreceding on. Better worse so. A little better worse than nothing so. Next the so-said seat and germ of all. Those hands! That head! That near true ring! Away. Full face from now. No hands. No face. Skull and stare alone. Scene and seer of all. On. Stary on. Say on. Be on. Somehow on. Anyhow on. Till dim gone. At long last gone. All at long last gone. For bad and all. For poor best worst and all. Dim whence unknown. At all costs unknown. Unchanging. Say now unchanging. Far and wide. High and low. Say a pipe in that void. A tube. Sealed. Then in that pipe or tube that selfsame dim. Old dim. Whenever what else? Where all always to be seen. Of the nothing to be seen. Dimly seen. Nothing ever unseen. Of the nothing to be seen. Dimly seen. Worsen that? Next the so-said void. The so-missaid. That narrow field. Rife with shades. Well so-missaid. Shade-ridden void. How better worse so-missay? Add others. Add? Never. Till if needs must. Nothing to those so far. Dimly so far. Them only lessen. But with them as they lessen others. As they worsen. If needs must. Others to lessen. To worsen. Till dim go. At long last go. For worst and all. On. Somehow on. Anyhow on. Say all gone. So on. In the skull all gone. All? No. All cannot go. Till dim go. Say then but the two gone. In the skull one and two gone. From the void. From the stare. In the skill all save the skull gone. The stare. Alone in the dim void.Alone to be seen. Dimly seen. In the skull the skull alone to be seen. The staring eyes. Dimly seen by the staring eyes. By the staring eyes. The others gone. Long sudden gone. Then sudden back. Unchanged. Say now unchanged. First one. Then two. Or first two. Then one. Or together. Then all again together. The bowed back. The plodding twain. The skull. The stare. All back in the skull together. Unchanged. Stare clamped to all. In the dim void. The eyes. Time to--First on back to unsay dim can go. Somehow on back. Dim cannot go. Dim to go must go for good. True then dim can go. If but for good.
