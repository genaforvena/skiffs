Listen up, you hear me? We're gonna be doing this the old-fashioned way, no fancy fancy. We're gonna keep it simple and to the point. We're gonna get it done and get it done right.

So, let's talk about that body, the one we're gonna be takin' out. We're gonna get it done, and we're gonna do it right. We're gonna make sure that it's done right, or we'll do it again and again until it's done right.

We're gonna start by takin' that body and plunking it down in a place where nobody's gonna see it. We're gonna make sure that it's hidden, so that nobody can find it.

Then, we're gonna start beatin' that body with our fists, until it's bruised and bloody. We're gonna keep beatin' until it's so bruised and bloody that it can't move anymore.

After that, we're gonna throw up and go, and we're gonna do it again and again until we're sick of it. We're gonna keep on throwin' up and go until we're so sick that we can't move anymore.

Then, we're gonna throw up and back that body again, and we're gonna do it until it's back in its original place. We're gonna keep on throwin' up and back until we're so sick that we can't move anymore.

Finally, we're gonna keep on beatin' that body with our fists until it's so bruised and bloody that it can't move anymore. We're gonna keep on beatin' until we're so bruised and bloody that we can't move anymore.

So, listen up, you hear me? We're gonna do this the old-fashioned way, and we're gonna do it right. We're gonna make sure that it's done right, or we'll do it again and again until it's done right.

Listen up, you maggots! Now the one, the twain, both. Fade back, then the one, the twain. Both, fade? No, the dim goes, the void disappears. Say yes, each time, the one stays unchanged. Somehow, it's always changing, but never truly gone. Until no, then the back changes. Somehow, it's always changing, but never truly gone. The dim and the void, they vanish and reappear, but they never go away completely.

Each time, the one stays unchanged, but the back changes. It's always changing, but never truly gone. The dim and the void, they vanish and reappear, but they never go away completely.

The one can go, the twain can go, but they can't go down. They can't go down, but they can never stay still. They're always moving, always changing, but they never stop.

So, you maggots, listen up! The one is forever kneeling, the other is forever standing. The one can rise, but only to its knees. The back is always turned, the head is always sunk, the eyes are always dim.

The void is always there, a constant reminder of what is lost. It's always there, a constant reminder of what is never coming.

So, you maggots, listen up! The one is the only one, the only one who can go. The twain are the shadows, the whispers in the dark. They are the emptiness, the nothingness.

Now, go, you maggots, and do as I say. Do as I tell you. Do it all for me. Do it all for the one. Do it all for the twain.
