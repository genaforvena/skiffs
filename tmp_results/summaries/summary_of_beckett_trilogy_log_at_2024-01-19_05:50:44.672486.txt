Molloy
I am in my mother’s room.It’s I who live there now.I don’t 
know how I got tl^pre.Perhaps in an ambulance, certainly a vehicle 
of some kind.I was helped.I’d never have got there alone.There’s 
this man who comes every week.Perhaps I got here thanks to him.He says not.He gives me money and takes away the pages.So many 
pages, so much money.Yes, I work now, a little like I used to, 
except that I don’t know how to work any more.That doesn’t 
matter apparently.What I’d like now is to speak of the things that 
arc left, say my good-byes, finish dying.They don’t want that.Yes, 
there is more than one, apparently.But it’s always the same one 
that comes.You’ll do that later, he says.Good.The truth is I 
haven’t m’’ch will left.When he comes for the fresh pages he brings 
back the previous week’s.They arc marked with signs I don’t under- 
stand.Anyway I don’t read them.When I’ve done nothing he, gives 
me nothing, he scolds me.Yet I don’t work for money.For what 
then?I don’t know.The truth is I don’t know much.For example 
my mother’s death.Was she already cjpad when I came?Or did 
she only die later?I mean enough to bury.I don’t know.Perhaps8
SAMUEL BECKETT
they haven’t buried her yet.

In any case I have her room.I sleep 
in her bed.I piss and shit in her pot.I have taken her place.I must 
resemble her more and more.All I need now is a son.Perhaps I 
have one somewhere.But I think not.He would be old now, nearly 
as old as myself.It was a little chambermaid.It wasn’t true love.The true love was in another.We’ll come to that.Her name?I’ve 
forgotten it again.It seems to me sometimes that I even knew my 
son, that I helped him.Then I tell myself it’s impossible.It’s impos- 
sible I could ever have helped anyone.I’ve forgotten how to spell 
too, and half the words.That doesn’t matter apparently.Good.He’s 
a queer one the one who conics to see me.He comes every Sunday 
apparently.The other days he isn't free.He’s always thirsty.It was 
he told me I’d begun all wrong, that I should have begun differently.He must be right.I began at the beginning, like an old ballocks, 
can you imagine that?Here’s my beginning.Because they’re keep- 
ing it apparently.I took a lot of trouble with it.Here it is.It gave 
me a lot of trouble.It was the beginning, do you understand?Whereas now it’s nearly the end.Is what I do now any better?I 
don’t know.That’s beside the point.Here's my beginning.It must 
mean something, or they wouldn’t keep it.Here it is.Summarization models summary:

Molly doesn't work for him and doesn't even follow his orders.  She just keeps telling herself that she can use the old pages she just got for free. But not the ones in the new ones.  Some of the old ones have marks that Molloy is terrified of and that she tries not to touch, like the one on the left side
