  Essex of Nantucket, which was attacked and finally destroyed by a
  large Sperm Whale in the Pacific Ocean_.” _By Owen Chace of
  Nantucket, first mate of said vessel.New York_, 1821.
  “A mariner sat in the shrouds one night, The wind was piping free;
  Now bright, now dimmed, was the moonlight pale, And the phospher
  gleamed in the wake of the whale, As it floundered in the sea.”
  —_Elizabeth Oakes Smith_.  “The quantity of line withdrawn from the boats engaged in the capture
  of this one whale, amounted altogether to 10,440 yards or nearly six
  English miles....

  “Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air, which,
  cracking like a whip, resounds to the distance of three or four
  miles.” —_Scoresby_.  “Mad with the agonies he endures from these fresh attacks, the
  infuriated Sperm Whale rolls over and over; he rears his enormous
  head, and with wide expanded jaws snaps at everything around him; he
  rushes at the boats with his head; they are propelled before him with
  vast swiftness, and sometimes utterly destroyed....It is a matter of
  great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so
  interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an
  animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected,
  or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and
  many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have
  possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of
  witnessing their habitudes.” —_Thomas Beale’s History of the Sperm
  Whale_, 1839.  “The Cachalot” (Sperm Whale) “is not only better armed than the True
  Whale” (Greenland or Right Whale) “in possessing a formidable weapon
  at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a
  disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once
  so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as
  the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale
  tribe.” —_Frederick Debell Bennett’s Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_,
  1840.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about
the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever
I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
get to sea as soon as I can.This is my substitute for pistol and ball.With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
quietly take to the ship.There is nothing surprising in this.If they
but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her
surf.Right and left, the streets take you waterward.Its extreme
downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
land.Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.Go from Corlears
Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.What
do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.Some
leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep.

But these
are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to
counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.How then is this?Are
the green fields gone?What do they here?But look!here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
seemingly bound for a dive.Strange!Nothing will content them but the
extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
warehouses will not suffice.No.They must get just as nigh the water
as they possibly can without falling in.And there they stand—miles of
them—leagues.Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
and avenues—north, east, south, and west.Yet here they all unite.Tell
me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thither?Once more.Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.Take
almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.There is magic in
it.Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this
experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professor.Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
ever.But here is an artist.He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley
of the Saco.What is the chief element he employs?Summarization models summary:

There stand his
trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were
within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up
from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.Deep into distant woodlands
winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
their hill-side blue.But though the picture lies thus tranced, and
though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were
fixed upon the magic stream before him.Go visit the Prairies in June,
when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among
Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop
of water there!Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel
your thousand miles to see it?Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon
suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy
him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian
trip to Rockaway Beach?Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a
mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
of sight of land?Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?Why did
the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?Surely
all this is not without meaning.And still deeper the meaning of that
story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned.

But that
same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.It is the image
of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my
lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a
passenger.For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a
purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.Besides, passengers
get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy
themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;
nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.I abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them.For my part, I abominate all
honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever.It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory
in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I
never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously
buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
fowl than I will.Summarization models summary:

It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.And at first, this sort of
thing is unpleasant enough.It touches one’s sense of honor,
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.And more than all, if
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
awe of you.The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.But even this wears off
in time.What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks?What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?Do you think the archangel
Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance?Who ain’t
a slave?Tell me that.

Well, then, however the old sea-captains may
order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or
metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,
and be content.Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that I ever heard of.On the contrary, passengers themselves must
pay.And there is all the difference in the world between paying and
being paid.The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us.But _being
paid_,—what will compare with it?The urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no
account can a monied man enter heaven.Ah!how cheerfully we consign
ourselves to perdition!Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.For as in this world,
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle.He thinks he breathes it first; but not
so.Summarization models summary:

In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.But
wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the
constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in
some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else.And,
doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago.It came in
as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
performances.I take it that this part of the bill must have run
something like this:“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._
“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.“BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short
and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I
cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the
circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment.Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
himself.

Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity.Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all
the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,
helped to sway me to my wish.With other men, perhaps, such things
would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an
everlasting itch for things remote.I love to sail forbidden seas, and
land on barbarous coasts.Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to
perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let
me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of
the place one lodges in.By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
CHAPTER 2.The Carpet-Bag.I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.Quitting the good city
of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.It was a Saturday night
in December.Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little
packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
that place would offer, till the following Monday.Summarization models summary:

As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.For my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a
fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island, which amazingly pleased me.Besides though New Bedford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket
was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the
first dead American whale was stranded.Where else but from Nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes
to give chase to the Leviathan?And where but from Nantucket, too, did
that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in
order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit?Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a
matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.It was a
very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
and cheerless.I knew no one in the place.

With anxious grapnels I had
sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to
inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The
Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there.Further
on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came
such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay
ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from
hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
miserable plight.Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one
moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of
the tinkling glasses within.But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t
you hear?get away from before the door; your patched boots are
stopping the way.So on I went.I now by instinct followed the streets
that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not
the cheeriest inns.Such dreary streets!blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.Summarization models summary: 
The young candidates for whaling stop at the same place as the candidates for the journey, New Bedford, before embarking on their voyage.
I initially planned to sail in a Nantucket craft because of a fondness for the island and the history connected with it.
Nantucket is famous for being the place where the first dead American whale was stranded.
New Bedford has been gradually taking over the business of whaling and has become a dominant force in the industry.
The story of the Red-Men, who first sally out in canoes to chase after the Leviathan, originates from Nanticucket, and the first adventurous little sloop, a sloop laden with cobblestones, was launched from the island.

Merging and summarizing: 
At
this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
the town proved all but deserted.But presently I came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood
invitingly open.It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the
uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble
over an ash-box in the porch.Ha!thought I, ha, as the flying
particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,
Gomorrah?But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then
must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and
hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
door.It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.A hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.It was a negro church; and the
preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping
and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing
out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”

Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought
I.But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this
Peter here is an emigrant from there.As the light looked so dim, and
the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated
little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here
from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
as it were, and leaning over sadly.It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft.Euroclydon, nevertheless,
is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the
hob quietly toasting for bed.“In judging of that tempestuous wind
called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where
the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only
glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my
mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well.Yes, these eyes are
windows, and this body of mine is the house.
