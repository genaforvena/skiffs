PREFACEThe  purpose  of  the  present  translator  has  been  to  render 
the  poem  of  Dante  into  modern  English,  line-for-line.A 
preface  which  should  attempt  to  state  his  complete  obliga- 
tions would  look  like  a  bibliography,  and  would  certainly 
be  unsatisfactory  in  one  phase,  namely,  in  the  expression 
of  just  feelings.Long  study  of  some  books  which  never 
disappoint,  such  as  Toynbee's  Dante  Dictionary  and 
Charles  Eliot  Norton's  prose  translation  of  the  Divine 
Comedy,  makes  a  mere  mention  of  their  titles  almost  a 
personal  neglect.One  would  also  gladly  record  his  grati- 
tude for  pleasure  and  profit  from  writings  that  help 
genially  and  with  an  ample,  scholarly  generosity,  such  as 
the  commentary  of  Benvenuto  da  Imola  in  its  original  form 
or  as  expounded  in  the  valuable  Vernon  Readings.In 
view  of  the  essential  inadequacy  of  any  enumeration  of 
books  used  such  a  listing  has  not  been  attempted.

Since  a  metrical  translation  is  a  work  of  art  as  well  as 
a  work  of  science,  the  translator  must  avoid,  when  he  is  at 
his  task,  consultation  of  previous  poetical  solutions  of  the 
problem.Given  the  Italian  text  and  sound  commentaries, 
it  has  seemed  merely  honorable  to  rely  solely  on  one's 
control  of  the  English  medium,  unaided.That  the  result 
should  prove  the  same  as  another's  in  very  many  cases  has 
not  caused  discouragement.Translation  of  the  Divine 
Comedy  is  progressive,  yet  the  time  seems  not  yet  come  for 
a  variorum,  composite  version.The  English  language  has 
after  long  literary  use  become  sufficiently  clarified  to  fur- 
nish the  verbal  and  rhythmical  means  of  embodying  any
viii  PREFACEthought.Experiments  in  imitating  foreign  excellences 
have  their  own  interest ;  yet  criticism  rejoices  that  the  day 
of  mock-Miltonic  lines  or  like  solecisms  is  past.Purity  in  rendering  is  now  so  highly  esteemed  that  the 
intrusion  of  an  explanation  into  a  text  is  intellectually 
resented.Only  Dante  could  tell  what  he  would  change  if 
he  were  engaged  on  the  Comedy  today.

Merging and summarizing: 
As  Dante  is  a  very 
great  poet,  every  quality  of  his  style  demands  considera- 
tion ;  his  choice  of  words  and  of  their  place  in  sentence  and 
in  line  can  not  be  deemed  fortuitous.His  firmness  of 
phrase  is  that  of  a  living  organism,  and  not  of  a  crystal.The  beauty  and  strength  of  the  Italian  language  and  the 
charm  of  rhyme  as  used  by  the  poet  are  not  to  be  enjoyed 
completely  by  those  to  whom  the  idiom  is  not  native.An 
English  translator  of  the  Divine  Comedy  has  at  his  com- 
mand, even  if  he  were  perfectly  in  control  of  his  medium, 
only  the  strength  and  beauty  of  his  own  language;  his 
results  can  be  at  best  an  English  re-expression  of  his 
original,  and  with  such  rhythmical  qualities  as  are  pleasing 
to  the  English  ear.

Good  workmanship  asks  the  favor  of 
no  poetical  or  other  license,  but  claims  the  privilege  of 
occasional  expression  of  a  necessary  connoted  value,  for 
example,  of  a  **then*'  or  "there,'*  or  the  use  of  an  ellipsis 
when  the  Italian  poet  has  worked  thus  economically.It  is  a  fact,  perhaps  not  too  obvious  to  mention,  that  a 
translator  of  the  Divine  Comedy  must  receive  his  first 
impulse  from  within,  and  must  continue  to  the  end  in  a 
kind  of  solitude,  looking  to  a  reward  that  is  ideal.His 
object  is  to  attain,  without  sparing  himself  conscientious 
endeavor,  a  faithful  result.His  courage  is  his  own,  and  he 
values  above  price  the  personal  help  which  he  receives  from 
friends  as  unpractical  as  himself.The  present  translator's 
indebtedness  is  great  to  the  corporation  of  his  college  for 
their  indulgence,  which  has  rendered  possible  the  making  of

Bowdoin  library  that  has  generously  supplemented  his  own 
working  collection  by  the  purchase,  especially,  of  the 
reprints  of  the  editions  of  the  early  commentaries.His 
debt  of  gratitude  to  three  friends  who  have  gone  over  the 
proofs  of  the  translation  can  not  be  adequately  stated  in 
a  few  words.Professor  Kenneth  McKenzie  of  Yale  Uni- 
versity has  given  the  translator  the  benefit  of  invaluable 
critical  observations,  of  a  scholarly  and  literary  excellence 
that  it  would  be  impertinent  to  praise.To  Dean  Kenneth 
C.  M.  Sills  and  Professor  Frederic  W.  Brown,  colleagues 
of  the  translator,  his  obligation  is  intimate  and  of  wide 
scope  for  helpfulness  in  discussion  of  every  factor  of  his 
work;  their  unstinting  and  self-sacrificing  willingness  at 
all  times  and  the  contribution  of  both  when  aid  was  needed 
leave  the  maker  of  this  book  forever  in  their  debt.It  has  seemed  well  to  put  in  an  appendix  rather  than  in 
footnotes  translations  of  the  Latin  which  Dante  employed 
in  the  original  text.
