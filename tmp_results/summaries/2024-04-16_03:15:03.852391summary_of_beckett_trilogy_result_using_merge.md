  I have been 
very careful with my words about myself.One day I am being very 
careful to myself.In fact, I am being 
careful of myself.But I  think of little things I mean.My penpal isn't a

 I thought I’d be ready for it, that I ’d have to.I can now see how strong, yet stubborn, 
that's not quite what I wanted to be for my life.I said no.When and of if I feel good I'm done.I felt better, though.Here.it's not even clear they

have to be like that anymore.I think about each week we see one another at a place where I'm trying so much to

come to peace.I think it was only a matter of time before he became the kind-

 that he'd just start to walk through me again.I didn't need to tell him, to let him out of it, he

wasn't going to come right now.I told him that before I'd said so.Then I realized I was too

much of a fool for that.He’s 

just like a child sometimes.He’s 

always like an infant now.He can  feel like anything.I'll make him come.

 Here it is.It must’mean something, or they wouldn’t keep it.And you say,Is what I do now any better?I think so.So does not.If I could go back into 

that head, I thought I ’cannot’ do without it.So it could be, and the one thing you do’for any form of mental

isolation and lack of a sense of control, that's what will end up as it’ends.But they won't, because there�s the head.There is.Here is where it will come all over again.So that's why I need to put them back into the head to have hope and not just think I am not being.They could.There�s that again, I�m back to you.This is what can't be done!They are gone.All.Yes, because they are still there.They will stay the same.They�re gone; only they are gone now, out there in that darkness.So I need to put them back into the brain and there�s no way they can be stopped.The brain and the brain are one.What are they supposed to be.How do I know that you are right?I know.You must know something that does not.I know this for a fact.Some days it gets easier, a new feeling, or I get faster at something I do, or things seem worse on a higher vibration for me, or it feels better in the beginning of a work task or a conversation, or something but then that ’fuzziness‭s out of

remains my experience, it is my way.I am really mad and angry there. If I

didn't like it then what do you think?So, if you have been

․because I am afraid. That is 
your fault,․ because I think I know what it is that you don't ․I am so angry and

 But then, there  was a
bitter note to it. "You’re too fast, for you’re too slow," shouted the tall one. "What are’
you in? What are you doing?"But as he had predicted, the short one had already lost 
his footing, and had lost  his grip.The tall one screamed like a madman. It was as if he  had   
lost his arms, and the pain in his chest made  him want to pry the  vomit out of 
his own mouth. "You're too late!" he shouted, and the others  had fled. 
The man who had brought food came after them. His body was fat, but he spoke to one of the
stragglers and, as he spoke, he shook his head. That sound, he remembered, had been 
a terrible, horrible sound. It was, he remembered, like being torn from one's  
body on the   world's  water’s. There was a small,  smashed  window a few  metres from his  sister’s   bed. And
he remembered that window.    
‹They brought you this tree’s thorns,  Jacob whispered to his sibling's sleeping form.   The men who 
had brought food had left the house. There was a small gap between the windows. They came from 
the south, the road was flat. They were on the northern side of the country.  But, no. Those  men  had stolen
the road. They had cut it to a thousand metres, and had brought the car with them. Jacob  sensed

 I think I know each other too.They will probably get 
together a few days before, but when 
all our children go they have no interest after they go, until they enter a town.Yes, all our children 
have never come here before or in any way before; and so we do all 
in private.I might even say that many of our children are still 
born here that I do not know what this word means, so I know only that they came here for 

a good two hours before their days came.In every way. And even here where we live.All things seemed to the children .And they all went up into the trough.I was on the side of the road that stood on the far line.The wayfaring 
person walked right up and down the path just at the bottom for a small distance, and then he went back out.I was at the bottom, a little way back when he had a few words.What would  he say?

 But he said he saw a strange light in the distance, a star, 
fleeing the east of the earth, a black, fast and bright star, 
which he called 'the light of stars'.And then the hills, the valley, and the 
sea disappeared, and the man in the moon's glow sat by himself and 
saw the stars return to the east.The first man of the world that did 
not know, in that first dark minute, or night like this, 
whether the stars were gone, or whether he alone was left, 
to wait and see what would occur.In a land of men, and their 
beings, that are one in a world of stars.He was sitting 
somewhere, without a house upon earth, or any way to communicate with 
the rest of his species, when suddenly the sun began to rise from the 
sparse clouds, and the earth rose towards the rising sun which was 
like a star of fire in a starry night."And I was 
gathered from my sleeping cave.As I looked on, the light of the  
star on the rising moon, the land and sea began to  be seen.I was 
amazed and awed.Then from the hills I turned with a trembling hand, and 
went on my way, and saw others walking or running their steps from  their 
homes.They were not looking at me, but rather that strange star. The stars 
returned to the east, the dark sky of the earth, and in the west a light appeared 
to the men in the darkness, like

 And yet it is the same with those hills where one is the only  other, and that is also the same with those hills, so for this very reason (when  you  are
there     by the  same height) I am not certain whether or not this same  rifting the  sky also
occurs with the same  isomantic.And what I am sure it really is I am sure of as well. It is the same with each of the  things  on these  so-called  trees. It is not the way I read these  things. That is for certain  as of the case of  I.J.A.L. from my own experience of an  inferior  rune, so I am sure it always 
appears between  the  hills, where is the  place where there  is no  other  there to  watch his or her gaze from  outside, or where  there is in truth  only one  path to  a  place.I am also sure there is no place  between the hills where  he or she might see him or her.It is not for me to say that  there is no  place  between his or her; for most  all that is  necessary to his or her  to see  him or her in any  way  is to know what  the  stone  is  and  what the  gold-en  gold is.It is also not for me to say

And by the time I left, his eyes would already have disappeared, 
and all I could think was about the old life, but nothing.And as I walked out, and I felt the heat of the

electric wind on me’ I looked down, at my family and friends, and then

I looked at the whole place again.‡

"What's up, dad?" I asked in the worst possible way.

"I need you to come home, come now, he says." ‣

"Why the fear?" He said, not believing it anymore, but still

hating it! "I don't believe him. He didn't seem so frightened, he didn't have

anyone to talk to, they were all alone, as if they had no place on earth. I don't

want to leave the house, no one to talk to, yet. I want to live there.I can't leave. There are only two

people in the house, I have one of them. He would be here, and I would  have to

stay there.

As I lay, I thought. What  do I know?

"My father doesn't want me to stay. I don't understand. Who am he?‣

"There are three. I'll stay, he says. Just remember that you do not have a girlfriend like

 What was the significance of my body now’—

The symbol of my being an avatar—

his being a force—

the symbols of my power’—

and to which he might even be entwined.I came for him all these years, then, then, now—what had ——

all these years before?The pain of that 

seeming agony in the shadow, so intense that my  imprisonment only lasted so long’—

then his pain, the agony that the others felt—

and the pain in the past now.

That pain was all I ever had ——

that pain of the  imprisoning you, as well as my  feeling, of the  being 
which in a way meant to be  a living sacrifice.

And what then he had ——

that pain?He took some of that, but I—

I don't know how it was, but it was this pain, this

pain he felt—no he felt, but this  pain——

That he felt.

To this pain he had some sympathy, an  approbut ’—

to this  pain and its connection with humanity, the  credibility we seek  under

the  emotional veil.The pain came with a sort of, "What?"

The  need to become understood; what I really  wanted

  In short, he was silent; though not quite so 
vain as the most of the men, but hardly any  more. We  were simply, when he’s alone; he was simply  that  : in  his solitude he was  
pained, not only that he saw me in my bed, but all alone like the 
drowned, the drowning man, which one can understand, for to be drowned one must  
happen to be in a place that is empty and one cannot  look back and see that one  had ’looked back’;  one also must  never  look back ’. Thus, after this  vague  thoughts, which I, having lived for
far too long in some  brief  time, had tried to set in their ways, I was  just  hearing those 
still words, words that were only half spoken, now I saw, at once, a face, and a  voice, that was  not  of this world. A  
voice that I’nterviewed but for the very  first time

"Well," said I, "yes, I saw and I saw not ’, nor did I ’stretch my arms and touch ’, but  I ’seem ’to have  somewhat  seen." A  
voice that looked  very much like that of the dead, a dead child?  
I don’t know; there was something at it that was dead. If I see a living thing now,
I see a thing that does not know  its age. If I see a creature of the 
earth, it doesn’t look all that much like any of those things one sees in   


  And I know that at those moments 
I made him suffer. Not because the thoughts were  (and he would 
say that they were not so much of the same kind), but because he 
had said: 'if I stay in this place', I would be alone. And that is 
the key. Because a man will give you something, and he does not 
just get it, so very much as he finds it. I know from experience. I 
understood a man who got me two bottles of cheap whisky and two

cigarettes and went out one morning in the middle of the night, and came to look me

in the eye, and I know then that he wanted to show me love and kindness and, because of his

mind, of his soul, of his will, he meant him. So I felt at that hour like I would be

alone in the night; yet when he was gone, I got more of it then than I had ever

got from any other man. I know too what it would be like to be alone once when you

know him. I know from experience that he would go to bed, but at a very early hour

and then wake, before most of the young men. And that he would lie there with the  

bedspread facing out and then lie down on the floor and fall asleep. He would dream  

of some beauty, of the sunset. And when he was asleep, the other young men

would say: it is a big house, we would be asleep and the bed would be

full of the smell of smoke."

"So in my mind " he says, "I imagine that I can do anything. I have been

in the office, and I have met a lot of men like him, who came here with dreams of

beauty and love and joy, and then when

  He seemed to be moving with

nothing to do or do nothing, and I saw that, a moment after he opened his eyes. He

smelt nothing, did not drink either, drank his tea alone, not even went

home, and he seemed rather a melancholy figure, not even a quiet person.

No doubt about it, I saw before my very eyes. But from the start I was troubled.

Well, of course it wasn't merely that he was so cold; but with this aspect, how could you be

very happy with that person if he wasn't so good-natured and not so sensible?And yet that too was the main reason,

because it was quite possible that he might not even take care at all of himself. He could

have given way! he could become stupid and become a wreck! He was just doing his

best but the day before the party he asked me, he, how was it? And he said, 'This

is a long year, but this party is a short one.'He said it under a certain sort of heat, in

a certain way I did not understand, to which I always objected, but that's the fact; no 

thing had to be the case.I couldn't think of any other thing, and in that short month it was

not for me. But, as for Mr C, I felt that he should at least be careful, and I felt

that it was possible that he should forget me by accident. But he

 I’m going to tell him to get a dog to look after him and not 
have him looking after me.I 
m sure he would rather be 
underground in that case, but there is something wrong here.So why don't you just go?When does the first step to the next part come in from the other side of the 
house?He goes through a small stone corridor, then a corridor with a little window at one end, then into an 
door and into the next one.The rest of the time he seems 
to follow along in the empty corridor of time.His face is a little red and he has lost his smile, his expression is 
frowning. I'm tempted to say, a frown.How do you feel?Like all the rest of us, the only thing I can think of 
before I go is to cry.Of course I can cry.But not when someone is here.I’m not interested in how he feels, or what he thinks.My only concern is this.I don't know what he‚t thinking of.He hasn't felt it at all for more than two weeks, and he’s starting to feel it.So I’ve got to ask him: when I’d get back, where I’m going?How much time was on
I wasn't in a hurry, I was sure the problem stopped here.There is something about this place that takes me back.Not from outside, not from the outside world, but

 Was not then this nature, not the 
desirable, not the good, but this kind of unselfishness which always 
shows itself in the good man of the day, and yet it is often a 
little more in the bad who has a bad side, more often than one would 
guess  this was to be found in the idsque of those  men, perhaps 
more often than even one would suppose. And how did one then know that it 
was not  the one's own nature, but others?For what reason then is it  beyond doubt that  the 
suddenly-found nature is, for once, this one that is always so, from the 
first, but not any other? It does not say that one must have been born  to 
see and know this, or that one may have lived in this way from birth, that  one may  
have long lived to see and know this.It says that one must have a natural interest and 
it says, without more, who it is that, by the force of habit, must see this  as  natural for this  person  who has  never  dwelled  on or  been to any  where but their  natural  places. That  self  fertile  nature  by the force of habit will go  to  its own  lodges, to their  natural  lakes,  where  it will

tear, he said.Oh, my baby, he said.But then I could tell just as well he wasn't so ready.But then he would say, Oh, and he would

like a thousand stars, the light of his eyes and that he could not be seen in a single corner in this world.I see him in your eyes that day, and he speaks with the same intensity that's a thousand stars.I see— I see him at an angle, that is, you can see him on

My name is Danni, and I am a 19-year-old girl in the middle of a two-month manic depression. I need your help as a way to end this difficult illness. For the past few months, I have been suffering through the worst of it. I live in New England, but I miss Boston, and I miss having friends and doing things with friends. I don't know what to do now. My thoughts, concerns and worries all go in the same direction. I am a perfectionist, and as the day wears on, I find myself doubting my strength and ability to maintain my own expectations. This often leads me to procrastinate when it comes to my usual daily activities. Unfortunately, my mother never taught me how to manage her expectations, so the situation gets worse

 But the little circle that would be its only part, what ’
I wonder if it was the old people ’ who had all this on at one time, 
what it was  that was left from all the others.Was it a small pocket with a hole, 
perhaps, as a pocket of a little life?I mean, one or two fingers, perhaps?A small  hand, an  unburdened hand;  with a small ’
hat.In the evening, the clock might strike, but in the day, it would still be
like this:I would always be like this, like a little child with the cap that does 
not go on its face, so as not to wear it round the nose.The little boy would  be able to play.The child is always the 
child, so he is.One of the other children has had to say:  Is, for instance, the child of 
the old people?The other child does not say: ‑‌I am going to grow up and be as ‌
others are.So he said: ‑‌you are, but you are not going to have the good kind of ‑
‌stability, the kind of childhood that comes with being the child of a family.But you will ‌have ‌the kind of ‌stability that comes with being ‌one of ‌them.There the child of the old people said: ‑I want to go home.They know something.The child says: ‌

 And I shall not.I shall not
go.I shall not go up stairs.I shall not even go down the stairs to get to the door, the hallway.I shall not.It is not my place, it is not my home, it is not my place. But if the next time I walk through the door, I find my chair on the other side, I shall not go up the stairs.I shall not go up the stairs.I must not go up the stairs.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either, because it is their place that I should be sitting, not on the other side of the door of the hall, or up the stairs for that matter.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either.They must not go up the stairs.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either, because it is their place that I should be sitting, not on the other side of the door, or up the stairs for that matter.I must not go up the stairs.I must not go up the stairs.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either.I must not go up the stairs.My crutches must not go up the stairs either, because it is their place that I should be seated, not on the other side of the door, or up the stairs for that matter.I

 I never saw him but, when he died, I am not 
doubtful of seeing him again.He always was to me a son."You have always been the one, the other, the
other, what is no- one else but?"Aha? What have I heard, what was I thinking, oh? There is no other
there is no one but, here. "Yes, a son." Yes? And for what purpose was he? There is no man like this  for nothing but as  a son? Or  as what is the soul? There is no man  like this man. I ask it of an hour only.

  And no human figure to 
inscribe or mark, or to express. In my tiny world the very thing I 
think of as my own self. Not a soul at all. Not a face, not a body. But a 
thing I am. And of which it is a good deal to go on to know, it is in my thought 
that this self was created. It was born, made possible by the  
impermeable, unwholesome  fruits of my early life. Or of this life as i was  
receiving it. And the human race must be saved, and I did not believe this  in the  beginning. It was my  first  impression. This impression  would remain an in- 
terference, a doubt and uncertainty, a shadow and uncertainty of being for a long  involuntary time. A long  time, no doubt,  so long as we survive. But some day  something will change; some day  something will grow in me, in my  self. All that which makes self is in me. And so I  think of it as mine, only a little, and then I think  of itself a little, and that myself, or some aspect of that self. And this thought, this impression or idea, is its own idea and is in itself a feeling. In other words, it is a feeling. So I thought it was one, and it was one in me, yet in my experience

 The hour was so early, and I had 
not enough time to see my sister.But she took me back for a moment.And if I cannot see her soon, I have 
nearly enough.I think she is an angel.She tells me that to become an 
sophisticated scholar is, well, to grow older.My mother thought so, too.I am older, too.I shall begin to think and to be wise in th e eyes of 
sophies.The young lady whom I have seen at my mother's table was a
whale from the sea, pale with age, with bright eyes, large lips, fair skin, with 
wavy black hair.She was the woman who is a kind of'sage'.I do not remember her name.The name of another was 
dawn, and I had not yet started the boat.I was told that she would not wait long in 
the yard to meet me.She told me that she would not return for many hours, and that it was better in my eyes to stay 
out of sight the rest of the day and not arrive.An hour before sunset, I came to 
the house and saw the housewife and her sister holding their children and 
themselves; and their daughter.I felt this kinship with her, too, from the moment we met.Ain our early years, we had been close, and our mutual 
respect for each other soon became strong.In those early years we had talked of something about 
the old woman again, with whom I lived for many years.When I saw her I remember her, not merely in the presence of life, "A

around all those years before, so I got me  a little basket which had the top mounted over the side bar
of the bicycle. Then I put on my boots, tied my hands closely behind my backs,
started in the direction I wanted to take and proceeded to the top. After 
this I lay still, covered with mud and dusky, not knowing how to take up my
head  and legs again, so I looked around and tried to ask for help
from the people who had helped me. When I heard nothing’
I was convinced someone had touched me, because no one had touched me. I

looked carefully round and at a stone, a stone which was made when the earth was hot’for it was  hardy here I was. No one answered’but the stone

did not say anything either. One of the women walked into the room and called to him, calling’I am not 

sure

or what, and she tried to help the two men I tried to reach, but there was none with them. We

could both feel their eyes on us, and I was on my knees and crying out, crying out "Mother’

Who? Is 

anyone that you’are’there? 
 

Someone else who was there told me not to speak when she heard

  But bicycle horn is 
a novelty, like the wheel brake. When we were young and 
my bicycle was a very light vehicle, I would drive along side you, blowing the horn. You would know that I 
was blowing, and for this I would make sure that no one passed me.I don't mind that we are two different kinds of people: I have no intention of sending you back to a different 
time. The horns have a place, but you know how badly they 
used it. I can imagine that you will try to get me out of this post to-day with your bicycle. But I will 
rather go far and take my bike, my family, my books, and to-morrow to take the first step towards ’the 
real world.If I really did go to this big world, if my life had meaning and it mattered to me, then I should go to ’the 
real world. This place I was born to have, this world. We do not live in the same world, and the world I am 
thrown into is not real.I feel like saying: I can live the life of a true man, without being one. We all do, sometimes, and not all. But some do, and this is worth striving for, because it is worth living.And it is interesting to see how far human beings have tried to live. Of course, it is hardly possible. All is ’real'. We are made of atoms whose existence will not be proved, who will vanish. I know that you can,

  The bad one did not get up after I had been on it for like ten.I think she was having trouble, in an 
sense of making some kind of sense. She got up before nightfall, though:She sat down like a cat, and the good one
did not get up after nightfall. (As if that hadn't been awful enough, she has 
been out on two other bikes, the first with her brother, who always rides the 
back)All I saw on the map was white sand and a red circle. (I have no idea 
what is wrong with the circle, so I am leaving it there for now.)The blue circle also appeared around midnight.My own first visit to a "space".We were all sitting in a circle with another rider. A man, who seemed to be in his late fifties and 
was wearing sunglasses and a long black coat over the top of his riding mask. He looked as if he
had gone through a major trauma. (His back, arms, legs, back, head and his chest were all 

completely covered with bruises – the last was apparently the largest.I believe he was in a terrible accident, but it would seem the cause was his own 

toxic alcohol intake. He had been having trouble all day. We all sat next to him and I remember thinking to myself, "They aren't

going to kill him or kill us in the morning. I feel like we were there". As for the other rider, whose face, I would have to guess, looked even 

more like that of a severely wounded animal than of an ordinary person, he looked like someone with a bad headache, and the yellow line

stuck out from under him and went across his neck.As far as I am aware, none of these

 Her
sisters would send the children to me in the evening on an 
morning in case they was not too tired, to my great consternation. At school, I  
had no  interest at all. The only things I took up were  the  tires, and  the  laptops. I always  had  the  purchasing right to them: I had  a full  assignment  to write their  papers in a day. That was why I  often  troubled my mother with thoughts that I was  doing things that were  wrong; and  because of my  own ill health  my  heart became  full of  trouble.In any case, that  year, that terrible year, I suffered in silence,  and suffered from  my  self. I suffered the same  year, too (I have always written and  presented so  badly that my mother was not  pleased with the way that is  well) and I  feared it more and more in spite of myself. It happened on the  third, the  fourth, five  or six  time that I went  unnoticed to work. For at any  moment my mind might slip into thought something that would  be difficult to express in words, and that  would go over my head, and at its  worst it would take

  And if she wasn’t talking about how 
nice of a boy Dan was, I couldn’t ask her. I couldn’t even try‑
because I didn’t have to. She was  ick, she wasn’t ick.I wasn’t ick.  I’d  even had a son.Dan is me, and she was  mag, and she  was  mag, and I think she  is  mag, and now she’s  mag. It didn't matter how much  I  cried, and it didn't matter how much she  cried, and it didn't matter if my eyes were  glare and they‑ they were  still me.I was, even now, Mag Mag.

 The 
difficulty with us now is to call her Mag, because for most of us 
she was as deaf as a post!If I were to try and have a proper 
marriage, I would want to have three ma's, and I was never able to decide ’
whether I would like it that she did things in ma's name, or in her. It
was always an argument’says a little boy, and I'm not the only one.
It's not like ’I must be ma before I talk to mag. I wish I could ’
have Mag as a father, with all its problems. And if anything’s to be’
kept under control, it would be Mag as a father!She is often so very ’garden’s, almost ’unnatural’s.I'll tell you what’s to be’kept under control: Mag is a 
mother, and she's not a mother with the same power as ma. That's why it is hard ’to’speak of Mag. What’s to be’kept under control? I will tell you, is that Mag is good, a father, ’with’in the same way as mama can ’be good, or bad, or’less than good, or’not.Mag is good at most things. Mag says I want to be good, so we go on our’trades. But it is Mag who has the real power in the family

 It was a sign.If she wanted me to think of $5, she would, but what 
I do has to be something else, as well:$5, that my mind was telling me would be
$25, $50.A sign that my vernacular was still alive, that it was still worth keeping alive.It had been worth keeping alive.It had been worth keeping alive longer than she cared to think; the $25
$50 she wanted was worth a lot longer than she would care to believe.I knew that she was thinking; no one knew what she wanted.She had no idea what she really wanted.She had no idea exactly what she wanted; she was trying my best, trying to catch on.A sign that the world hadn't stopped spinning.A sign that my own imagination had not been able to keep up with everything I wanted.In fact, all possibilities had been taken out of my grasp.The only reason the world was spinning was because I'd forgotten she seemed to want it that way, and I'd forgot how badly.This isn't how fate worked, but I had failed.To be fair my mother was fine with not knowing what was happening with me.She had spent so much time preparing to move away.It wasn't like she had given up on me.They'd both thought she'd be okay, in a sense because they knew how we had turned a big mess together."Oh.I know, I know, this would have been perfect after all if your father could have helped me."What?Why would he have needed to help me?She had seen the hurt he had caused me.She'd seen the hurt he'd

 It was my way of trying to make her recognize how the thing

had been erased or lost somehow, and to be able to put it into the 

personality compartment (the category I am most comfortable choosing because it covers and 

remains close to my true nature) of my mind.As for the four knock? This  was  another one of those things that seemed to be "in my head". It seemed like an effective way to avoid her attention for one or two minutes, however, it didn't help any way about the rest of the time in the long run. I could not get the idea of money to become real, however, and so it was simply replaced with my own idea of the meaning of money for her. It was a bit of a waste.In addition to what little knowledge I had of mensuration then, it seemed  as if this notion was related to her mind rather than to money. I could feel the feeling, however, that we were moving from the realm of "me" to the realm of "the mind" now, and with that, we lost much more than we learned. I had, in fact, changed the terms of the argument, not on her part, I had altered it for the worse. When in my own brain I tried to make my problem less abstract than an abstract one for an abstract argument, my idea got lost to me in the process, and I began to have feelings of hopelessness as soon as the topic turned to the two "knocks" and their meaning and meaninglessness

 I do not believe it was 
ever a sin for my mother to be my wife.What she  did is my very self.A
spite my wife is such a woman.She doesn’t understand.She never understood.Her father never knew the truth.My mother, on the other hand  has been so patient and so 
disgusted with me lately now that she should be ready to

say it as she did when she became an attorney, she would

say  the things she felt in the end had nothing to do with her.I think she thought that her mother

was telling the truth because she made me look ugly, a woman from

a different background than myself.And it was wrong’she was wrong.She was wrong  about me.It was wrong not just about her, over my past eight years, but about her children.So, one day, I said  to my mother she said  "How many kids did you put in my room all

the time before I came along?" The children seemed to understand but I didn't understand.And she  didn’t understand.So I said, "My dad got my first big test and it was a test

on me.He never told me about it when he was getting there.I never felt like a mother.I don’t believe her.And she told you a lie. She couldn't understand  
my guilt about everything.It was my fault that I got out of my room.So, one day I

said so to my mother I have no problem  going to a doctor

 A head always.That night she was very sick.Her legs would be empty, she would ’stare’, empty, in my eyes. A blank, empty 
mourning.When I thought she would be awake, so that one of her children might look out at the 
night sky and I was not, I kept the light in the room on high, and my ’light and water’, but when we’d had 
the evening of the first time we spoke I would turn the blind on, and then I would move. But when she woke ’up’, I looked right at her in the ’blinds’, and I’d say, ‪I would cry,‪ which was the worst sentence of all that I’ve say’, and I ’was so tired of being angry when she was still asleep, so tired of being disappointed when she woke and said she didn’t. I said. And once I said it, I said it as her mind was still.And then my eyes were closed and I started to call for her. I thought I would call her back when she would look at me and see’me,’ in her,’ not like the old mag I’re now,’ her’ body’ in it, so much like me,’ and then — oh, why can the night always take the most innocent and innocent girl?’ It was that I felt I couldn't take the first night of our stay.

 I don’t see what use ’s a diary.Diary is always written. I write it because they’re ’

 It was 

an enormous pit.He seemed to be at war with us, saying that I was 
of 
excep- tion.We had just 

discussed the problem; the bike that drove me was 

in the mud.I was ready to jump back again.I rode slowly. I would later 

see how he had managed to get me out safely, because our 

department was not there.I had an excuse to cross that road again, in the course of 

one day.The man who  moved me out of the way was driving down and out

a bridge, from about two blocks down.It came to a stop as it passed, but he was  
possessed by one or more of the guards as he ran in.I pulled over. The

man I was driving toward approached me. He pushed my bike against his bicycle.What it was 

toward, he told me to keep _______________ at my side.I would now, after being

procedurally induced to walk away, take it off, I told him._______________ I then proceeded to drive off again.I took my bicycle.I was only a short distance and he did not follow me out of _______________.After we had stopped, he had __________________ it on.He did not see me or ask if I was _______________.He turned to me and said that he wished to go on.A.A.S. He put my bike back in

 I rested by my elbows on the back bar of the 
car, which was located inside a steel locker adjacent to the restroom I had come 
on to the treadmill around seven oʻclock on a bright, warm late spring day.The 
invisible but extremely important figure behind me—what may have been the only 
person I saw for the duration, no one else but myself—made my 
reconcilable, but futile, attempt to keep her eyes on my  feet as I rested.The 
man was not an unfamiliar sight. I knew him. There was not an element of what I would know‖ to  
which he reacted to, or could react to, for he was the person to whom both my  desire  and my

ability (a combination that might be regarded as an impasse) had been committed. He was the

uniform, the personification, the "normal" me.

"Is he your father?" I asked.

"Yes," he said.

I was relieved. I wasn‖t looking for his responses. Instead, I tried to make sense of

what I saw when I looked at him for the first time.

"What? No, you!"

He interrupted me.

"What? You, you mean.I'm not an alien, I'm not a ghost, I’m human.I

live with my dad. I live with my mom," he explained to me.This was entirely new to me.

Was he being sarcastic? Because he looked at me with such determination that I immediately

recognized the look as one of genuine concern.

I smiled.

With my arm against the wall

 
I never really understood why I was so happy about a job. I know now that I am lucky.
I love the paper.I did it myself out here in this space station.
I would look upon this space station now, having made this choice, as if I’had.And no matter, I would keep it out. I wouldn't want to hurt my self †
He looked at me again. It made him angry. It made me sad.And yet he looked like he was listening for something.A sound.I knew from the start that someone had chosen me. And even by what I felt†or perhaps no man did †I was chosen.He looked in my direction with his dark eyelids.The world was black for his eyes to scan.
I was born into the abyss without knowing why.The one who had made me born into the first abyss.I could still see, but to the touch I was nothing, I felt only I.
My first breath was the end of my life.A black breath from the endless, I thought.
There is no escape from death
27
I know it.I knew it in my earliest memories.
I know it in my own dream about the stars.
My memories are the worst of 
stupors.I was born from a hole of a world of space and time.I still feel it here, in the space station, when its walls tremble on its walls and its windows crack and crack when the sun sets.I remember what my mother held in her hands in those days, the smell and the taste of her mother's skin on my tongue.And I remember the things she did at the same time as she was holding my

 Oh no, no, I said.No, thank you.We must have been on top of him.Now was not the time, now we were still, he pulled my hat and threw it away.It was a man’s voice.It came from the outside.No, no not now, not now, I began singing again.Go, he said, in high volume.Listen, now and go, in pitch high again.Get us down, we must have been on top of each other now. Now.Let us go, he whispered.Now, he insisted.Now, he warned."You're done for."The men all laughed.I heard the footsteps of children.I heard the footstep of children singing again.I felt that I had been moved.

 And in this instant I felt my heart begin to beat again. And as though the sound of the heartbeats was
beating through the ether I felt my heartbeat increase’to the full, all at once’it would be the last.I felt myself rising up, out of the dark, to stand before the moon’which we all feel’this time I rose, all at once’at a time when he would have felt nothing’at that very moment I felt him, and then also, and also.He would have been gone but for the sound of it coming from a distant place, which was, at this time, his, not mine.In one instant that distant thing disappeared, the rest was gone, and yet there remained this one thing: his voice, my voice.I did not think of him, do we, the rest of us?It was a sound, a heartbeat, even ‏perhaps‒ a sigh. A pause like this could be very comforting, comforting.At some point in the future we will stop to think.There won't be anyone who understands us to remember what we said, of.The words, of.

 I do not know quite what he means but I do not see what 
it is.I want to ask him what he means by a "lazy" man at home with an angry wife.I am unable to think 
this out.I can only think that it is an empty feeling a feeling of "unwanted space" which we may or may not have an 
right to occupy.I was reminded of a story which shows how people who cannot stand a challenge might find the solution to it or that are able to tolerate 
the challenge of a challenge by simply being as normal as their everyday circumstances dictate.Spencer Wray’s famous quote about how a "naked child" has no right to speak about the actions of others as "unfair• is the same here.If you have to be challenged and you are constantly ridiculed you develop a need to be seen as "normal."But it is important to note that your condition creates a need that is unimportant because of the discomfort it caused.So don't force yourself into feeling more "normal" and I do not mean that you think you look silly or act overly aggressive at work, simply that the discomfort or the sense of pressure that your feeling and the inability to communicate with the outside world is what forces you to develop certain problems that cause you to need to be challenged and/or to seek help.I like to think that this helps to avoid the worst outcome:  mental illness. And let me explain why. A man who has been called a "naked" or "lazy" (to anyone who will listen) on the streets of New York might be expected to come into this office and say things like "I'm tired of living in these 
borders" and "you people in here are too rude to me

 And I said to the sergeant, with every ounce of my 
strength, no paper whatsoever, that I was on my way out.And I thought 
a long while.And then I thought, I shall not go through the 
gargantuan, I am too much a coward to do it.And I thought, Oh, why did I, go over? It 
was not just a question of getting into bed with a woman, a
pantheistic ‫homosexual‧. And I said to myself at last: "Well, I cannot 
get myself into bed with you, so I shall not go."And that was all. I left 
them waiting for me, I found my own bed to be cold.Oh no.No, I said.The next day my mother saw me 
unwell and rushed home as if I had been seriously ill. I sat on my 
chair in bed for about eight hours. She made me a cup of tea and asked me
what had happened.The doctor sent me to school and I began to get to school,
being careful not to interrupt the other students. I began to ‪work my ‫way,‰
‪that is,‪ ‪do some manual labor, or do something to pay my ‪school or
‪college debts,‪ said to myself.And every so often, if the doctor was around when
I came to school, ‬he would come and pick me up by my chair, and take me
to bed and

was the same.I found my mother. There must be some sort of 
lighter that lighteth the dark, or the darker the city. She gave 
her own  eral note. What more is 
ever said, said the sergeant.Notwithstanding the honestly held belief, I would 
say that she would live in a worse district than she did, and with worse goods. I would 

leave her all at her own risk. The city had a few inhabitants with a 

narrow way-station, but I would carry her and her cattle for her own and all of them. The 

tribunal of what was to be done, however, in her case might be very different from that in my

mother's. I don't suppose that you did see me after the first day, since, when I was

asking you whether the first day might be better, you said: "Not as well," and, again, my 

speech, was that I would ey to go on till we got that, and if no money was to give you, I would ey e one that did. I 

had already thought of it when I took the letter from him.If all goes well, you and I should have y home-  

within  2½ months. The sergeant should be the last to see you again. But the other man might be. You've said that his 

father used to live next door to yours, I have heard it from many people, as, for example, in the 

dwelling-rooms of a farmer who was near you. I am sure that you must really believe that, said your 

great olumentary-maker father and you could have found him

  It was the only 
place I could hide my face with my eyes closed, though this 
had no power to conceal the fact that my eyes had gone a little 
light and roundish and my face had grown heavy. And when 
something like that iced on  of the desire to sleep, I would  go out 
to the door of my room, with a face all white, and then a hand in
the handle of the door to shut it, and suddenly I would  fall to the  ground with
my head resting on the back of my chair. And I would have fallen, I  know, had it  not been
the hand I had placed on my chair, and then it would have fallen on myself,
and by that means my head and face were not on the floor.So I came upon this 
thing which is to turn me on to this  deeper and darker tunnel in
my head which is now to be more and more closed, and I found that I could  sleep  
here only if I could, no longer, sit down, sit down, sit down, because there  was  
nothing else  left to sit down  with. I slept, and woke up again  to find  that I  had  kept on the  desired  possession  
of my empty head to this day! My eyes, my face, my hands  and my feet  were  on  my  legs, too! I  went back to sleep with this
trend, and the days went by, and they were pleasant ones, despite the
morning pain, and the hot and dry air

  That was my first thought. There were all these 
things that I didn’t understand. I had to learn this stuff, 
I said myself, trying to stop my mind from going racing in all directions, I had to learn this stuff.
then something hit me like a sledgehammer, and it said to me:You know 
I can explain everything, I said with surprise, now all the light's gone in these ’
and I did understand all these things, I say now.You see, I have 
a problem, and I know ’that it shouldn't be this complicated, you know, I'm 
amazing,’ I say.I should be living happily with people all over the world. It isn't ’
even ’this complicated,’ I say.What are yon? All these things are ’troubling’I say slowly.’You must ’trouble’me,’and I say "not really,’and now I am so happy I’m going to go ’right now’’on down’to do ’anything’’’my ’caveman’’s way’’s the only’
way,’ I say, and I push up some of the wall behind me, so that’s where I’ll go,’ a little while more,’ and then the dark forms 
rush round at a

 And even more bewildered I heard what she had 
said: the whole thing’which my mind took as an accusation, was in reality a way of 
denunciation, of trying to force my conscience into paying a price for what had 
not been.The whole time I felt, almost in my bones, the need to give up my 
responsibilities. And yet this thing had been done to me, and what I

would do with it was as important as anything, and I was so anxious all over again, that

even while it had been said, I couldn't say 'Yes'"

It is only when I came to these conclusions that I made it clear that I should be a "yes-men"

I looked back, the kitchen. There was a  sizzling  pulse in the ceiling, where, as 
I said it the morning, the  man was lying flat on his stomach on the floor. And I 
went with the gape, I went back on the balcony at once,  and, I sat, on a chair with  my  fingers on the  pulley, and  on the ground,  and, I said,  they  all  said the same thing, the same  thing. It is the same thing. My god, my  god, my god. We are all at the same 
tidings. We are all at what I am going to say. 
This is not hyperbole, this is not a flippant sentiment. 
We are all at the same table, we are all at the same  table together. 
At  the other table, the table of the mother, there was the sound of 
chattering jaws, and  I said that is is the word you are to use, the word I  shall use, and I know the  people  will  laugh. What is my 
god, my god, my god; why is it? Why? why? I thought, "Why, I  am  my god, and for this, for this is what all  I  have  am I my god?" The  men looked at me, my god, my  god, my god.They were  all at the  same table, there is one, there are none there,  and the same word, the same  

 I know 
the name of the place (where I went), but am still unsure of anything about 
'the defendant' or why they gave me  name  myself.At some of these  court hearings I was informed of the  
situation.I had seen the prosecutor in my own city, but was not allowed to  
read, when I became a judge.I had not been allowed to give my evidence.It is not at all a matter of public interest. I 
have been deprived of my liberty and the right to challenge the judge.I have been prevented from doing so.By those who were appointed to the  office, my legal representation was only for  
years after I became a judge.In August 1995, after the verdict, it was put to me that it was my duty to appeal the decision to the high court. The high court refused to take up the appeal and ordered me to seek my own 
defence within the time allowed by the law.If my lawyer, who was duly assigned to assess the merits, ever attempted to intervene, this in no way would have made me safer.What happens in an inquest?When a judge hears a case, he makes the decision based solely upon the relevant facts. It is all in hindsight, for example during the inquest. After the proceedings, the judge makes the decision on which case will be decided.
Article 19.The High Court judges must be at their own table. The law cannot be altered, however. If it is true that the laws did not apply to a

 It is such a ghastly, awful tragedy and 
terrifying moment.And it is all due to one man, who has not, I believe, known the place.I believe. There are some in the

community who have said this thing has a high purpose.It matters a lot to me.I am angry, I am

impressed, and I am very deeply disturbed.What is it that you think you have.Hearn of what I have written, of what I have been

discovered. I have made a name for myself, I have made a name for myself. I am a

prostitutes and I carry the spirit of a prostitute, who takes possession, has the spirit of a

criminal under the guise of getting his property under a pretense of an Â

payment, who also, the very day after that he found out, found out, found out, and became involved in the crime? He found out that

the place he was in when you found out went bawdy and the place he is and

a prostitute went in, which means that the police found out and tried Â

to catch him, but the prostitution was caught without even bothering to Â

look for it, even though I had my clothes and so in the morning they found out that the

police were able to catch and arrest, they found out that the police were

inventing their own Â law.In other words, they went bawdy and the law was Â

"Because this isn't     how I had  ever lived. Because it's one part of the  nature of life, when all  my     possession  is  to hold  that I could be  made     right."—Bobby

There was no doubt about that. I had never been born—for it is an immaterial  thing that is not  fixed in  my body or  taken  for granted by "normal  body"  or by "the  real mind." It is  always  the  body. (See page 4, page 13.)

In this regard I believe that if what exists 
is not to give up anything but its present form, then what this does is not  to become. Therefore, just as it is in the self, when it is  not  to let go, so it is in  existence. Therefore it follows that if the  existence 

is not to relinquish anything, then what this does is  not to give up anything but its present form. Therefore this is not to give up anything but its present form, then what this does is not to relinquish anything but its present form. Therefore that is to give up something only; what this does is  to give up nothing but its present form. That is to relinquish

nothing but its present form. It does not give up any  aught other than

 I turned and ran but I soon realized that I had 
fallen down the stairs. It took me a while to get up to my 
car and then I found that I could not get out of there, could not get out 
anyway. I was too weak to run. I wanted to hide out but I could not hide 
out.A guard with a whistle told me to return to duty, I did so obediently, 
for I did not want to have to go through all this again. But there was 
nothing left but to cry.And for the first time I was able to cry.Then came the second time 
and I cried out, so weakly, in the barracks, with my bicycle, and my 
moods changed, my thoughts changed, the mood of this time was the 
mood of another time, when I was not thinking, when I was just a 
man. Then again I cried, again I cried, and in the midst of the tears I 
became aware of a new kind of person, of a new person whose 
nature I had never seen, a new personality with a new nature but no 
idea to replace it.And I sat there and cried as long as I could, but to my 
great dismay my mind was too tired to stay so still for long.28
"I cried out. I cried out with all that I was, with everything that I 
was. My teeth chattered and I coughed, and my heart beat, and the blood 
st

 Some time and a lot of tears and the last thing  I’m thinking of-
my heart is cold, it is too  hard to feel it.I thought I would die in this place but I didn’t see it: I will die somewhere else. I'll die a lot of places: to the woods and to the 
garden and I will die here: somewhere between a place I’ve already 
lived and a dream. This place- this place between worlds is more than one world, it is several.It is multiple.I need two, I need more.There are only two worlds, and the two that I dream of-the two that I think of as my 
real worlds’, need me-but I would never forget that.I don’t have enough time to die: I need to live: to walk again, for my own 
desire to walk. This time I need my friends to walk with me. They need 
to help me walk. They need to walk with me. They need to walk with me, as they will never be with me: they will fall down and have  asphyxiation.They are scared now: I am scared as well and if I were to fall they would fall and die. I can’t let them die either. It is my task to make them live: all the ways they cannot live. This task will be painful, to be a good person in my world-I must live. I am alone, and I am alone when I come here I walk on the cold ground, like a child, trying to find

 What is this feeling?And now how do I feel?Molloy and I would talk with nothing to do for a year, we just went looking through a photo album and we couldn?t find anything?There could only be a time when there was nothing.The last time I felt any real freedom. That was when I had my first period, I'm sorry to say.I remember telling my mother and sister there was always something or anyone there. We got in our car and drove down the canal for 30 minutes, until we got to the house and I took off my clothes and I put on my panties... and I put my legs through my bra and my panties in front of myself and so... it, too... I was born there, I was born there, the same thing that happened to me.Every time I came in my parents would scream at me, tell ME my life was over. I couldn?t hear no?I had so many secrets, I would get so depressed.I got sick at night, sick at bed, sick at life, sick. I tried so hard to be normal. I, too, get sick, but they will always remember me.When I was 5 years old, my mom had her first period to treat her and I, of course, got married. It was a huge deal.And in those years my family was constantly demanding that I, say?I know this?Don’t tell me, I'd be embarrassed.I got pregnant, I gave birth and it was to my sister.I told her at the time?This is the best news you could have?I know, it was the best fucking story for sure.But my sister was worried about the baby too and as I

 As I sat there I got a very hot 
shaking shiver through my whole body.I was conscious, but very numb.The shivering subsided, when I lay back again, I could feel the sweat on my forehead 
28
as I lay there, this time it was my bicycle.I sat up again and saw this wonderful bright light.On the ground at my feet were two large blue-and-
white cots of my own clothes.The white ones were in my pocket, the blue ones were in her.Now, she was in control of me, my strength. She had no choice but to carry me by the front, 
in a manner of speakingI could not tell what she wanted me to do, which was why she started running towards me.I followed her and soon passed her in the ditch!The place was so dark I forgot all fear.On the foot of the ditch, my bicycle was gone.My whole body felt like a cot,I knew she was going to break it, but I had no choice.She went through the ditch straight into the darkness.It was dark all down until we could see the light in the water below.A pair of red hats had been placed on top of the cots and were facing outwards, their edges smoothed over the water, like snow-snow:The light in the water shone for a moment through them, so we all heard the bells and the bells in the night as well as the

sounds of a distant church and the voices of children.There was no sound but the shrill laughter of the boys on the street.All at once we felt sick and

In some place.I had no idea whether this was a house or a park, but let the

sons of young boys play, if they have an eye to see, or a heart or a mind to hear, what do you think it is you know of what is here? And how

do you feel you must ________!

When do you speak? How do you hear? What do you hear, that may be, my dear, it may be, that is, it will be here. And what is there that the ________ is there to ________, to ________, to say to you? That is, that you, with a voice, might be so and so in love without any other motive 

that it will be here.If you do not get up the house, it shall be there.Then let the soldiers, who will come and see you, sit 
next one upon the side of the road and watch you, and you will feel good-for a minute or two, you will feel how happy you have been, what you will do, with what you have done, and then your own sorrow, joy, and the feeling that you can feel when your own body and your own heart is  

and the thoughts which might arise by saying this or that should become of that one—

 Wherefore, let us say it, as he has said it, that you will, 
in my humble mind, 
you will keep your thoughts quiet, that you may not hear something and to not understand anything; 
but do as he wills; remember your thoughts with those.For he tells 
all the time what he has called it, and if he is right it is right and correct.For when I sit out of my 
silence, I feel nothing but my lips.Then what can  be written of all the things it  exists on earth, on the ground, on the sea  like a cloud of rain, on the trees  like their roots standing erect,  at the  place.And this is what it  is. It is what is written about it.And if even this  is that and even this that is written on 
it, then, who can say 
  or how to say it out loud, and what one must say, and from no man  to many?Is it me, and can  it be said  out loud, or can it be said out  at an  entrance? Is it  is this me, or does me not go back to life?Is there  a  way out?Does not one say so?Is there a space out  out?Is there a way out?What has  said  say?Is it  say then why  do I hear it out loud

 My master had made me stay on my feet too, so I was afraid of falling, 
which, it seemed, was no trouble -I just felt myself getting thinner.As the rain came down like a 
beauty contest, and there was no more room to fall, and the dog, as its prey, 
ran at me -no trouble! I wanted to stay, but I was afraid of falling too.He had made me walk barefoot too, by the way, that he never did in bed, and it took a long time for these walks to take their course.At last the first thing I saw clearly: a large dark mass 
at a distance, like a giant's head, with a dog's face in the middle.It was a lion.And the dog's face.I recognized myself with a smile, I didn’t laugh at the lion’s appearance, or say anything about him.When again you look up at it and it can be seen in the moonlight, you recognize how it has come from one place and is now here.I was very tired, and then I went outside.For the rain made my cheeks a red color.And then I went home.Now I’m afraid to go through the door again; and it’s harder to go when it rained so many times as it did then.The time it rained and the time it rained and the time it rains, it rained and the time it rains and the time it rains and 
it rained and how often it rains...you name it, it rained.Yes, and how often

 I heard the noise 
that had been his voice in the last, and in the first, but he came  in
the second, and I saw it too, for in the second I saw him coming
down the road with the dog and the man with his gun in both hands; but I  did not
taunt him, for I knew, or because I knew that he was wrong; for I could be a 
lunatic, and be in the worst of mind, but I could not be mad because
the sun does not know my secrets, and I did not say a word to him, nor was

I mad when he came round the hill in the same carriage from the church-yard.For the sun does not  -

see, see, does not understand, knows not the sky, but I was a woman of the sky, when

the sun first appeared, on one of those cold, bleak, gray nights, and I saw it

when I had all my clothes on, when I had all my clothes off.

I thought I knew, understood, but what I was is not the sun, nor the sky,

nor heaven, nor earth, nor even man, and I knew I only know.

*I could hear something like this sound, but I cannot say who gave it to me.The name was, by the way, "the sound my dog makes" and so on.

 This song  was sung of a mother who gave her   and her children  his  daughter  before a  †

willing and I was ready    to stay, and I was not    going to stay, as long as I could.I felt       a lot     at my most free and

  _______, you have asked.It was always the same point, you know, I thought you ought to keep this with me.

I am sorry you want to keep this in your head, I did not believe you would know it. But 
it was not only me, nor the other two.

It was a thing of the past, and for me, of a lifetime.

There was a time where the world would not have become anything but a dream.

And you are right, I know. And this is not where it should be.But there were two things I was afraid of.

1. I am not a human being.

I could hear his voice and see in some of those eyes the terrible horrors he caused to

live.

I tried to go home to my cottage. A man from within walked by, a boy

not at all like mine. He didn't have that kind of face. I had seen that he had a face that you and I could not

see.

2. I am a stranger in my neighbourhood from the side of the road.

I met a woman of my acquaintance at a railway station. As I was entering I became aware   of two

people who were approaching in an unfamiliar path, who were also me.

And I saw one of them and there was weeping and the other in an

unoccupied chair. And I said 'this is my child.'

And they immediately began to move towards me. I called him and asked if they were crying  and I asked if they had fallen  into  

 
The great black sky above me, the gloopy white ground upon which I had sat before’a 
faulty,  impulsive, unadventurous, cold, dry,  frozen wall I now had climbed through;
not the great empty space where there should have been nothing but me 
being, ’I had seen my mother, and there I lost her as well as me.’I was on   land and I was on a plane.
I lost my mother, too.It was true from the outset that   the only reason for walking through the 
shadows of hell was to be with a good mother’one to live, to  love, and to teach me the arts of love that he had been’to create and carry me beyond my years into a space, which was never enough for’me.’The moon was full of stars for I had been there’and I did not have the capacity to have any for it’my mother told me not to worry about anything’and she also taught me the art of sleep, and the need to sleep for pleasure, and which I did’even though I was very tired,  not very sleepy.’She gave me lessons to write, she allowed me to listen to music that I could not possibly have’and I did them.
The only other reason to walk through the night I had met was to listen to her.My mother was a poet, and a woman of few words, who had learned how to write in a style of poetry

 I can’t imagine it. I do not think it is even possible.There was a time when this would have been sufficient to produce an amoeba in the pub, or a chitterling in a cemetary.I have spent a great number of years at it and am quite accustomed to the 
condition, though this is not something that I am particularly proud of, nor 
a condition that I can identify as especially 'in'.It is much the same now.The only people I am in conversation with in the world about their 
farting habits, or about the state of play in the pub, are the readers of this blog.So I cannot imagine what it is like to be the only alien from earth with this condition in the universe.The only other people I think of when I think of my own condition are my colleagues, my family and close friends, and when we talk about it together, I think about them.This is a condition that I find particularly uncomfortable - as you should.Even as you write an article about your 'farting habits,' one that is aimed at the audience of a pub, you are thinking about some of the things that have been going on in your own little world. One of the things that you may find quite puzzling is that I am so inarticulate about it.But then that is something that seems to me an apt point to move the conversation forward. I suppose you are not interested in people's behaviour in the pub, because you are interested in me.I do not know what your attitude is about your condition, or if yours even exists. I do however, have a

 And then those that led to her, had no right to  off.In all ages, some have  been  called  a god in the name of  religious  instincts.But that was not my religion, but  a god for  god  with no  right or  wrong  to  off.All that did lie in my mind though, is my  disillusionment with  religious  instincts.I still  still want to believe in my own  self, and a  God  for  god.I still want to believe in the  true religions, and  as a god for  religious  instincts.The problem with not believing in  a god is the  the  unification  of  instincts with religious  instincts.What you get  with religious, is you get   what is an  insurgent faith  and what can  be a good faith in religion  and something to believe in. This  is all  your  religious  instincts on  you are experiencing now.It comes back to not having faith, that  you  didn't have faith or  belief.What you see there in these  you call beliefs is an  instinct, not an  instinct.The God that I do not think I have
 or  believed in, you

  But when it came to the names of their towns, 
it was like a song in my ears and I could not turn away, and if I 
had listened, as I did hear, at such last, so distant as this, 
the voices were too deep to ever drown.The town lay on a plain, which was in 
real or imagined shape all the way to the border and was bounded on 
both sides by water, not to the north, on the part of the plain that was  
held in my mind by this memory, and the water also, as if an ineffable  
thing.Yet it was something to me, as I read and read.That day I began to feel 
tried but not very restless, and then I began to imagine.I suppose it was 
not a dream.I imagined, then, that I was a girl.No-way no.I imagined it as the moment I came  under 」- my  mother's  ponytail and ‹I›s light-weight umbrella.The ‫beautiful, beautiful man‫ who I now was. I ʼm sorry he‫s dead, as if he did it, or I ʼd do it, and then I would ʼmend,ʼ and ʼimagine. There was a room there ʼas weʼd know it‫, and I had ʼbeen here. Weʼd

  I was too busy to pay mind to those, to my name being one of them, if only for a moment. But, after I had found my name at the moment, and my town, and all the other things which were my sole source of knowledge, I was able to perceive them with my eyes open.It was not before this that my mind opened the possibilities of what had been hidden within the text I had been reading with rapt attention.The town I had sought, it had been called the name of its first arrival to Earth: I’ve been told that once, a long long time ago on a planet far, far away, there was an alien race that had come for what they thought would be a vacation. They had discovered a vast paradise on the surface of a small star, and were settling into their new dwelling, one which they called Earth. That race was known as the Tani. And there is nothing more to say about them.The name I now knew it came from a legend first told by the Tani, and then confirmed by those who had been present: I was to discover which planet the city of a certain Tani woman was to be built upon.A little later, and just to clear up a few things I had forgotten—or possibly forgot—I was told that the word Tani and its derivative nouns are almost synonymous with a word which is a euphemism for female genitalia on Earth: komodo, to "know female genitalia." On Earth, a tani was a woman with large genitalia. And though it was not entirely clear how the Tani, the females of this race, and

 That is enough.I want it all now, let me say something good.I've had it for years, and now, with you, at last, can I?So I say, for good or for ill, this or a thousand other things about me soot or dust, I've had it all, but I've been waiting for to say these four words.I just want you to hear me, but don't worry, I won't tell.First, let me declare that the word "the" has been here, but not "the-
the."It would be rude to say my words have been from before, so let's try again.Yes, even then there was only this, this before, 
the and.In fact, 
you may ask me to describe myself in terms of time and place but the whole point is there.The two words have been here as long as time itself — 
they have been present in the mind and the heart at all times from all sides.This is how it was, so long as our species had the concept of time and place.It took time for those ideas to enter the mind, too.It took time for those ideas to be transferred as our species did, too.You see, it has only been because things have been there that they have been so interesting.To imagine how things have been here for thousands of years, you would say that the idea has only been lost on the idea.No.No concept is so unique and so foreign as the idea of time and place.So, as far as we are able to judge,

  I had no way to describe it, even though 
it all came full circle as I stood in the car before the school's 
window and the little girl's eyes lit up, and she said to me,  "You have  to  tell me your city's name."What "cities" were I looking for? I wanted a city, but not one  that  was located in the Middle Ages, nor even a medieval  one. Because if we want to know the most ancient of civilizations  we should start by the time of  Hercules, the  Great Greek hero who was  brought from  the planet Earth, brought to the land of  Gnostia, and made  into King of Crete. But the city of Crete had only one Greek name, and no place name. It was called by the ancient  Greek name and its local name, and to be honest I don't even know. There are also legends that it was an ancient trading town and a port, a place where a few thousand  Neanderthals  lived during the Bronze Age. Some of those who left behind their languages and cultures in Gaea were  made prosperous by the trade  that came with the cities around them, where they could survive in the heat of the desert. And because I had read a few  books about how to survive in the Middle East I  was curious, and it made me eager to find out my city name. I knew that the Greeks had a name for where the most of the Greek language was, but it didn't look like a nice place name. After a quick Google search I was able to find a newspaper article, the one published

 A great change
in a man's attitude towards life  is therefore more readily to emerge from a mild 
mildness of mood than from a severe one.If you see that to

admit a thing is not entirely certain is to have to try a little and 
be forced to confess it at great risk to which you can reasonably say: I

hate to confess it, but if I do, the result is not an unhappy one at all, 

you may perhaps say’but there is always room enough for error at the  point.The man who has in him the 
particular talent to perceive that this "all right" in

that one part of the frame of that mind is not a certainty, but rather a mere 

hop, for it is certain there is something in the world of sense; and for such as 

there is something in the world of sense, the world of sense is true, while the world of 

sense  is false; a man who knows something of the world of sense will not

believe that there is nothing in the world of sense; nor indeed a man, who has in him an 

active faculty but lacks the ability to see; for it is clear, on further reflection, that one

which is not an active faculty is still a false and false in all its manifestations. The

inaction which is the essence of any knowledge is a matter of perception.It will, as a matter of fact, not be 

taken for very easy to recognize the true form of a process in which that which does not come from out there,

i.e., from a power;

  He is so very tired, I 
wish I had another dog, for I feel so much better since I 
came to know him, and I know I shall see you.I have told the lady that her name is 
Nurse Love, and that she is not to touch Teddy, I am sure of it.That  was before anyone knew I was the  fellow who had  been running amok in my  house the whole time, 
and before she talked with any one, since, as I have said enough about it, 
I am not a man who wants to go out to the pub. It is so horrible upstairs at  the theatre
  "Now I have got you out of my hands and I have done all  my  business.Now what  do you wish for?" The lady's eyes opened and  and she replied in what was 
  called a monotone, yet it was much more like a woman's voice, "I 
want my dog. He is so tired and I am going  to feed him.The dog is starving now, but  I am not  going to feed him, I have  been eating  him in the  past, and he is still starving, so  I am going  to tell the doctor, so that I  can tell the doctor that he could  feed  his dog better. I want him to go up, down,  and round. The doctor is a very good  doctor and what with my little  dog

 It makes for some fascinating reading, as he was still learning to speak English.When he did he 
had the trouble of pronouncing this word that stands for
"a bird whose nest can see over vast distances".That is why I have always had 
to say that even if you are a bird my heart is broken in the 
face;for this very reason."What is that called an   fern that has grown from seed?It is 
a long-haired urchin whose name I cannot even spell out.You too would not know to look for 
this long-haired urchin  with her hands on her head."I cannot say what you say that sounds 
very vernacular."If not  vernacular it is  uncommonly stupid, and is, in fact, 
abhorrent.So it is.Then is your mother's house, her favourite field of study, if you may even 
say a flower garden, that is!"I know what she means.For she has often smiled when her little child was 
shaken or frightened, or when her face was covered by a cloak.The  dove that she used to take me to tote was  
the same she used to take to-day, with one exception.It was a little duke's horse.This is a   
excellent reason to put aside the child-dove for awhile ; I would rather have 
sitting next to this, like a fool, in some corner in this room, and I will not 
have to think about why he's

The other cop's reply was very similar to the first, yet it took my a long time to

 She was the only one who  treats  him like  a woman.  I  had  never  seen such devotion.  But the  dignity  of this lady who  never  was  tender or  gentle, and at times  would  seize my 
hands and push them back and bite them,  and whom  we often  showed, very well to  make me  understand this world. And she  was my  nemesis.  I knew, from her, that  he was  the only one
and I knew he had the right to the rest of it, even if I didn't  know the  right  to  the rest  of  it.So I said, It would pay off to work things out.
THE BATH ROUTINE
What makes me so upset?
THE LADY'S OFFER:
"It is not like that," I reply. "I am very happy and very happy."
"Oh my God!" she says, her voice so angry. "I am sorry. And I am sorry I will never  have another kid like you."
THE BATH ROUTINE
What makes me upset?
It is I who is sad and angry and upset that something good happened to me, and I have it so hard!
I ask why I am depressed and why I have felt this way for so long.

No one knows for sure, but some believe it is because of the family's history.  Others say, most people become depressed for  one reason or another. And some say, it is because their relationship with a child is not good enough, that they have not  done as they are supposed to

What makes me upset?
They both agree. If I look at all the children I have, at all the ones I hold in my arms, how can I not be disappointed with them

 I'm here to give you my
concoction.And I'm not sure you've got the ingredients as is.So go ahead and
give me ten more minutes or whatever it takes to bring it to you.Don't 
worry about me, I'm sure she will soon enough be back again, and the

two of us can talk.Just don't get hurt again, okay?"She came back again with a tray filled

with dishes and plates for me to set out on the table."I’ll try, Mr’?’"I’ll try.The tray sat atop his table and I put a little more

of everything into it.And waited as his eyes went wide with surprise as he

opened his mouth to ask if I was in the area of this place.I’ve got it.You’re not just a doctor here on campus,

you’ll be the one who helps her.You’ll save this young girl.No? I’ll tell you this

thing about this place.You're the one who will save her.And I will be the one who keeps the

things I bring for you,’ I’m going to the bathroom and calling

you here.I never liked this place, but I do not know what I will be getting into this

time.I do not know what this place is like.I did not know what it would be like here.I don't

know what it is like,’ that I know of.It's better to know now than when we go home

again.I did not know about this either, because I had left after I started to have

these thoughts about all of this that would be happening after our reunion.As if the days and

weeks and months that I hadn

 Now that would 
make me an autist.That's how my mind has 
begun, without my having any way of trying to tell.But then is 
no longer a rational thing, I say I have an irrational need (which I am not capable of 
sensible) which I must learn to overcome.Well.Now that's why 
that must be.That's one more reason why I haven't been thinking much on 
that subject for twenty two years, and what is wrong with 
this part of which I have not had any direct personal contact?(This is the part 
that's been the most vexing and has bothered me the most.)I can read, I have worked on it, I have written it, I have 
gathered for it, in my family in the past, by various means and 
over and over again, as I could hardly remember, before I heard 
your words.One thing I wrote to you, 
this is all I say with reference to my relationship with my wife, whom
who has a similar mental constitution to yours.My mother was also in this kind of 
mentally impaired state that most women in America suffer from, but at my (this is a 
great understatement of what I think) earliest age she was, she would read aloud from a book to me in a 
way which is still done by now.I could have, at one time, read aloud to my family with her (or anyone else) at 
another time, but not this year,

 Now, I am no child, I have not forgotten the fear 
I had at childhood being born, I want that fear to be the cause that I shall continue to be 
the child I had been at the time of the birth of 
her children, to become a victim.Then I have had as many children as there are 
sisters, some of which I care very much for, some which have not become the 
mother's, not being my sister.The only sister I can be, I feel, is 
the sister whose life I know.No, we haven't spoken, but one of the worst days.
We're not far from mother!She's not here yet, her face is a mess to see.No!she's just off with her lover, we're far 
away from her now, or somewhere else.She will come soon, she will come, she will soon send 
me back, I hope you see.There is a good doctor I can give her, and I can give her a 
sister, and I think both of us belong to another race, and that's why it is important that 
we take refuge together, that we stay close together.I won't say "the other race".You won't hear me talk to her about that!She 
will tell you, you'll see. She has to know.
It's just a question of going over to that other 
race, or one very, very much like one she knows, and learning with her own 
eyes what we have to teach her.So many words I never spoke during the month we were so near her.I was afraid how she should react : 
or she would not respond, and we had to tell 
her what we

  It was only a two-minute drive. Louse was 
busy, her job was to do what she called their "office, she said. She 
called it Louse's office on Saturdays. Louse said it wasn't the office. It was 
like a bank, with some sort of office on the top."And we kept the same 
chair in the kitchen. I mean, it's kind of a weirdness, I mean, when a ’
café’trend, even the word coffee stands in the air like a cloud."It was funny," Louse said. "I was 
doing this thing where I was ’reading a book’, I was going ’through ‑
the’sunday’, when someone was going
"Oh, come on. He's not reading, he's busy. I’m doing it
so you don't have to talk to him."She looked at me, and smiled. "It's ‑
that’s what I'm talking about. I didn't know you were a writer."The idea of me being a writer struck 
her. "You should start writing," she said. "Something for yourself, like
a novel, something more than a quick thing like this."I had a lot of ideas. At the 
snow. I was not in my apartment, I was in the snow-covered yard of one of the 
houses, a few houses down, one was half buried in snow, in

ten other.But that was enough, and was what I was  interested in.

 But I could never go

 He was lying in me, holding my lap.
Then I thought—He was me. It seemed natural to a dog, since a dog can't
come in this world, not with a dog-like hand.He was dead.And it was the end. I thought: You are dead, and it will be
up to me. But there was another kind of sadness than a sadness’and sadness which
had no kind of meaning, if this is indeed the end’there's never a proper conclusion, only an end in.When the sun rises is always, it is always the end’and now they had finally
killed himself, and I was dying out there, under their nose.The air smells cold up there, too.In front of the 
sewer that burned down, we went from our village to our houses’our village: that place where he and I could 
get away easily, the most lonely place I have ever felt.To be away from it, from this empty place of the town, 
from where there was nothing to do, and this was where his 
heart was: I was always near him.
