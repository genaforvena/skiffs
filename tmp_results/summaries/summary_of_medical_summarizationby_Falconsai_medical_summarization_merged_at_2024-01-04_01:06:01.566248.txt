metamorphosis by Franz Kafka Translated by David Wyllie . one morning , when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams , travelling is the curse of travelling and worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone anyone . when he was awakened , he realized that he had a problem . he

it can all go to Hell , but it isn’t always possible to go to hell . it is a very difficult time to get up early all the alarm clock has been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung .

Gregor was the boss's man , spineless , and with no understanding as in five years of service he had never once yet been ill . he wanted to give a full answer and explain everything but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: yes, mother , yes, thank-you , thank -you, Gregor . in the circumstance he was content with saying : 'Yes, mother, yes ,

the first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed , to get dressed , and most of all to have his breakfast . only then would despite its breadth and its weight , the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in direction of the lower bedpost . this he managed quite easily .

if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured , so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did . he could probably avoid injuring it .

despite all the difficulties he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought . after a while he had already moved so far across the chief clerk had to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming .

if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations . we simply need to overcome this because of economic considerations because of a variety of factors . greg tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too ; you had to concede that it was possible .

the chief clerk was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family . it was only a minor discourtesy , and a suitable excuse this morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear , it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you .

we report a case of a patient with a small symptom of it last night . Gregor gushed out these words , hardly knowing what the chief clerk asked his parents , “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us” .
