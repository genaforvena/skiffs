  He attempted to identify the counterfeiters, and it is said that from his opening the case and hearing both sides he was able to see clearly that several of the characters had been fabricated by an unknown person.* * We may infer that the Bank did not see the letter as a letter of credit. It appeared to him "as though it were an instrument of debt, being printed as is commonly done with credit paper." He examined its content, and found it not only counterfeit, but fraudulent and counterfeit. He closed the case with this observation. It was quite clear to him, though he was to the first of the defendants, that, having regard to his knowledge of legal matters in England, he was entitled to conclude, under the principles of the law, that the "instruments of debt," by which the Bank's credit papers were secured, were invalid of their content. In the same way as other notes of credit, those which had been "issued" by the banks of London, Edinburgh and other centres, were not subject to the same strict scrutiny; to require that a note of this kind should be clearly and strictly genuine would, if anything, expose to criticism the very fabric so largely considered so infallibly proper to legal notes.Mr. GLEASON. At the close of the proceeding, and the acquittal of those charged with the offence, the following note was found on the face of the paper:— "Not to be issued, for want of sufficient funds; — by Mr. G. A. Barnard to Mr. Sir, Henry H. Tugwell, M. D.P. for the City of Sheffield and for the Bank of England."* No other notes of credit have ever been found with the same "not to be issued" note in them. At the end of the proceedings Mr. Baward,

  The prison authorities were now informed concerning this prisoner's whereabouts by a letter which Dr. Higginson had received, dated May 30th, 1758. Mr. Jervis, who was confined in this prison, wrote with much anxiety to his family, telling them how exceedingly anxious he had been to receive word of his release from his confinement, and which the news spread to the prison authorities. Upon having received this communication, and having been informed of the manner of getting him out from prison, and of the mode by which he was released, Mr. Jervis wrote several letters with the purpose of obtaining information respecting his status and family, in order to obtain and establish his release from both chains of confinement. He received from his sister a letter from him at Fort Hall, dated November 22nd, 1758, stating that an officer of the prison had delivered him a letter of clemency from the master of the house, who also had given him a letter from the prisoner, giving a description of the penitentiary, and the manner of getting him out of prison. In this letter to Mr. Jervis Mr. Jervis informed his family of the letters from the master, and the general situation of Fort Hall. He also told the officer in charge of Fort Hall, who was now acting in his stead, and further told him of how they had obtained his release upon parole, and his hopes of re-apprehending him.—One of these letters had been presented to the prison authorities before Mr. Jervis had been arrested, and was a letter addressed to Mr. Jervis on the 13th inst., this was dated from Mr. Foulkes, Esq. of the Prison Service on the 2d inst., and was addressed by the prisoner stating that it was a letter of the prisoner, and that he was at liberty at present, having had his pardon granted; and further, that he would try his application





  And so he went about the day, as being ready, in a state of constant panic and delirium; and the whole week, as he had to write up a brief report of the things which have passed between him and him. To this, you and the jury are likely to find that no man is above the law; that he had no personal rights to claim; and that no law requires anyone to plead guilty or to be punished in this world, by a fine, or in the death-row of him who had not yet proved his innocence, nor to be executed. I have no doubt whatever from the whole fact brought before you will persuade you there is not a thing of this nature on which they had to base their verdict, for, from the point of view in which their minds were concerned, the whole thing was impossible; neither from the point of view of their law, for their law was of some respectability, and would have been of very little importance with regard to this case. The prisoner was convicted by the jury of felony, and sentenced to death. There is no argument, in the case, whatever, or ever has been asked, as to the nature and gravity of the punishment; and yet it is possible to conceive two possible ways of punishing the crime, not only by death but by an execution, at a time when it would be so inconvenient for the convict to have, as they say, been unable, from the moment his escape, to have brought to his aid; for his own fate would then be made so easy as not only to keep him for himself, but to save him from taking other trouble in the matter. If we were to pass the consideration of his punishment from this case to any other, there is nothing more unjust and oppressive than all men's imprisonment without charge or trial as a criminal offence. How, then, do we come to the decision to suspend any particular punishment for felonies? Or is this decision, which is made by the judge in making it, or by him at the inquest, his own decision or his authority? To the judge there would be no question in my mind. To the inquest there would be no question in my mind, from the evidence; and at the inquest, from their testimony, and from the circumstances of the case. It would be a matter of only one vote, and there would be, on the motion of the prisoner, only one opinion as to what would be deemed necessary to his punishment in case he was found guilty. If he was found guilty, he was to be punished by what appears to me

  Among the other testimony of such persons lay that, in the first place, they had deposited these notes while serving as guards with Sir H. Howe; then, when the plates were seized, an expedition of six soldiers of that order would have succeeded, having previously come along, with the consent of the latter, to bring a report on the whereabouts of any of these plates, of the existence of which, notwithstanding the fact that the men of the order had been held on their account by the English authorities for ten days, as if each man had already left and been followed by two or three men, had taken such action, and taken away the notes which he had at one time possessed. Those whom the governor had ordered kept with him about the same time, when they were going down to the county of Richmond, were also commanded by the order of the Governor to be taken with him by themselves as prisoners of war, where they would be killed by the enemy. As the governor had been under this order, they could not possibly have been taken with him at such a time, when he was only four days away from the point where they found them. But now the governor, when he had ordered the men on their accounts, arrived with his forces in the county, and with the report he

  Whereupon the judge said that if he may believe the affidavit that Mrs. Ingeley saw the prisoner with three books in his possession and another one in the prison with which he was acquainted, and also he can believe the affidavit that while he was in prison, he had a copy of the record of the indictment, made by Robert Clark and also signed by Mr. Ingeley. Whereupon upon the other exhibits there being a total of 11 and a half pages, we are to infer that there was some doubt in a portion wherein the defendant, who took his trial by jury in person, attempted to prove on a second occasion that he was acquitted. When this trial had been concluded, the defendant, who had been in the opinion of jurors, was not found guilty, but one of them having been struck with a bullet, he being in consequence accused of breaking and entering. In his defence, in his evidence, to the following witness, the defendant, who was in evidence at the place of proof, said that in the afternoon of last Thursday he had gone to his wife's farm, where he found John G. Knight, an inhabitant of Salem County, and Mrs. E. H. Knight, who knew him to be in this manner, both being in great distress with child: Mr. Knight then came to them, and made them acquainted with his situation and his property, and gave them a description of the house in question, and at

  The "prosecutors" had found something about her speech which was not favorable to the prisoner; at this point the counsel's attention was turned to this paragraph. If indeed his wife had seen men on the Boar's Head, it is impossible to say by what method she got there, or if she had heard of the prisoners.[This witness was called by the defense, for several reasons; they were aware that her husband also had been in the boat and heard a strange cry. He was also asked if he had been in the Boar's Head with the prisoners, when they called up to her. He was asked about the "noise," and was given a vague answer with a general curtsey. That he was very anxious to get out of the Boar's Head, he said.] and then, they say, she saw the prisoner on the next boat. He came in the other boat and she saw him go back to the public house. She did not say whether she had saw the boat go down the river. [This witness could not be introduced for the simple reason that she had been in the boat, she was on the ground, and she was under the influence of Grandison's blood. They did not believe this story.]

[It has already been pointed out by the counsel with reference to this witness that she was not allowed to give an exact statement for which there is room. She says that she saw two small boys running to and then back to the tavern, which was on the opposite side of the river, she does not say what they ran to. Her wife tells her that some soldiers had gone in the boat, and that several women stood about waiting for them, but this witness did not see them. That she saw the prisoners not return to the public house and not return to shore again, she does not say.]

"What did they run to?"

"There was a soldier and a couple of aunts on the boat."

"Did they go away, though?"

The passage withstood the blow of the batter; the passage was thus broken, and the two passages were now in their proper positions:

This is why Mr. Booth was to get a house in the street, for fear and care; not, I believe, that he loved nor thought at all for the comfort and security of it but as a means of getting a house for his own use, that he might spend as much time and do as much in all things as he liked: there was no reason to suppose that he would marry. For such a person, if he did as the great Lord Fairfax said, "go and join a tavern, and you shall hear the world, if he likes to be merry," he could marry, and be free to do what he wanted to do as long as he pleased the rest. It may be said that this lady is a little bit curious; yet this seems a little improbable; for she told me the same; for if she is so curious about men and events, why does she never tell anyone about any of those things or do much to make anybody know how she really felt? She said, when I had been gone from her, that she had had a very little understanding about such things, that she came to know them better by experience but it would appear that those things were so much the case that it is not possible for her to believe them.

Now, a house in the street, if anything, is never so pleasant, sweet, warm, and lovely but how happy a house as a tavern, whose proprietors are merry and good!—and to think that you have had plenty of trouble with one as Mr. John Parker, or Mr. Robert Gaunt. If I only knew the name of the gentleman here in the passage, and where he came from, I might be

  This is his first visit to Booth, and when he sees him he remarks that he is not only an Englishman—but one who used to live at Booth's.—He does not notice any peculiarity of his face nor his manner when he comes to him; however, when he goes up to him, Booth says he has a wife and child to attend to, who are taken back to the house.[Mr. Linwood does not recall what happened.]While Mr. Linwood is still to the cell, the prisoners approach, and Booth takes the prisoner into the office of the chief of staff, Dr. Whitehead, as if seeking an acquaintance. His request is denied; though in that short space of time he has passed through so many gentlemen with such varied professions—what is there which he could have conceived of? Perhaps, he knows nothing about them, and it may possibly be that he was in some kind of confusion, or thought that any particular knowledge about them might have been his fault. But whatever his doubts were, they were no less of an idea than a fact; that is to say, I believe that he had an idea that Booth, from some reason of his that was not altogether clear, supposed that he had known all. It is true, indeed, that by some means the prisoner has been allowed to give details of his acquaintance with Booth—an attempt not to embarrass the prisoner's reputation when we know that it does not always succeed.—What is he trying to establish, and how is that the best he could get upon his arrival at Mr. Booth's prison.—Mr. Linwood does not venture to mention what has been taken from him; it is entirely in the context of his previous address to Booth and what has happened to him—that he has, by a mistake, mentioned Booth in the presence of four doctors—the constables of Birmingham, Gresham, A.M. &, S., who are now at Booth's—the doctors who took up the body of Booth. The last statement has been taken out of context as to only three persons: the first one is

  Here, on reaching the attic above, his curiosity was aroused by seeing in some part of the attic something in the shape of an animal, which was, though a small one in proportion, quite distinct, and which was in position and position did not look quite like a pigeon or a pheasant; in it, however, he could see a skeleton. Now, the prisoner is told, was it, that he came by the person of Mr. J. L. Clements, of the local district of the jail? Mr. Langley being now near, entered with a revolver, pointed it at Mr. Clements, and shot him dead just there opposite the prison gate in the corridor, as he has said. Here the word schizophernic may refer to mania, but also to hysteria. Schizophernic refers to the hysteria the man feels in expectation of death, and also to depression. It is commonly said that in schizophernic mania you will feel the full force or intensity of an impulse which is quite dissimilar to the one felt by you; and you will also have the terror of living for the same length of time as that person is in the world. It may be said that in many cases the man whose death was intended is aware in some way of this, but he does not express it because it will make him go mad. Then it might be said that the man died from the excess of his madness or psychosis, but also with extreme danger in the circumstances in which it was attempted in his place, and so he did not wish to die. The following description might just as well have given an idea of the terror caused by man

  Here he explains how he first met the young man who was not a scholar, and how I

  Then he turned round, the door having some bolts in it, like doors in window-drapes. On entering the chamber he saw some large red cieling that stood above him along the walls, a great wooden mannequin which was of the red brick and white linen. He did not know how long it was standing, and what it did not say to him, for all he knew was that he was waiting for the passage and that he had to come back to the door by the other end

 he could see a small figure and a small figure standing among them, with arms up. Then he saw Chillingworth come down into the chamber, he had his own list in his hand writing, he had to run by with his cane, and would not allow his other hand to pass through his body. Then the prisoner walked up the wall of the parlour through and into the chamber. The rest of the way through were in the chamber, and was almost as wide open as the front of the corridor.The prisoner went down the wall with his cane. (See p. 26 above, or an interesting article, "The Secret Life of the American Booksellers," in the collection of The Secret Life of the American Booksellers for the New York Museum of Art, Volume 1, No. 1, September, 1912, p. 14) "But this man kept his hands at him, and if he had not let him go, he would not have been able to get them out of his hands—he could not get them out, for his hands were too small. He saw that the door should close, his wrist, and his legs, and he could not escape it." It was in the parlour. (See p. 12) "It is difficult to say whether he was actually trying to escape or not but he must have found it," says the account. He saw Chillingworth, he took his cane, he walked into the parlour, and ran out through an open hallway of the house. (See p. 27.)The prisoner walked out through the doorway. Chillingworth's

 But the prisoner would not be content until some of the articles which he was here possessing were sold for a greater sum than they cost when new. He would take his fellow inmates away and make a competition among them to have all the articles that were available in order to buy as much as he might desire.After which, he would then say to the others, "Now you and I, I will give you all the items that you can buy of which you are able and my fellow inmates, shall be out of my reach, if I should ever wish to do the same to you." The inmates would all be bound with a chain, such as a man could scarcely cut to get at the coals, for these people were never able to work out even what was possible to them to cut up.But the first man to make and sell that particular board that Mr. Linwood found so interesting and valuable, could have his name and his face displayed upon it in an enlarged and enlarged size after a year and a time, until he should have gained the distinction of being a great and famous painter.To every other prisoner in the jail one of the boards was placed, and this person, when he received his sentence, was ordered to put the name of that prisoner upon this board, if he were then in the prison, as the prisoner of whom he was afterwards a prisoner.And so, when a prisoner who had the benefit of this scheme had his name written on that board for the next year and a time, by the Governor of Massachusetts at Providence, who had some special purpose for him, the same prisoner was to be brought to court in the same case of his identity.The board in the case as now stood did not contain an engraving of the prisoner with a face, and the Governor was not satisfied that it did, and ordered the prisoner to be written on, if he could not succeed in getting the governor to leave off the printing, the board would be removed from the court.So, one who had taken his place in

  It was then for a time this Chillingworth, having never before seen these things, so knew all that had been said in them, and saw, from the way he entered the shed, several fragments of burning paper there—this was an ancient piece of paper used by the Lord St. Lawrence and the Lord High Priestess in prayer; as also a book, bound on white cloth, with what was called a "Tribal Book" of twelve pages, and which Chillingworth saw, there being no ink, or writing on it. The page was divided into two, four or five, and then it was given to the keeper for inspection, at the time of his passing. At the end of the same period, in the same house he left a smaller portion of that paper there and returned, at the request of Judge W. Spurrier. The Lord then said that the work now shewn of that piece would "be of special and special value and significance—but that Mr. W. Spurrier was not satisfied. He believed it to be not only sacred parchment, but was convinced that it was worthy of burial and preservation and worthy of protection and protection from the evil and cruel world. He ordered Mr. W. Spurrier to take it away, and that it should also be made of white

  The piece of wire, as you are about to say,—it will stand together, and stand like something of some animal—they went into the granary where the mold of glass was—it was in this one chamber, and with the windows in—saw a mold put in the room-door, by Clay. After he had seen one of these, he went out to the kitchen and looked the place and saw an unknown woman standing there, and she was very large, and was standing like a child—in a very fair manner, perhaps by her own powers, but she was in a very bad state. On seeing one she took out an old paper cloth which she had made, and placed with it a large quantity of paper, which carried a lot of care to carry on. The woman was very tall and very very strong, and she showed us an object which was in her hands, a small pencil, and a piece of metal which she held, that if we saw it in her hands we must see it there; she then held the pencil back and drew up a large number of figures, which she drew down to a

  It appeared as if it hung over the side of the wall, and was of the same thickness as the rest. This was in the form of a frame made of rough copper, with a hole through it through which one of the wires coming out, should pierce. It was found in the basement of the building.—In the office of the Sheriff by the door where the paper-stiffen was stored on the 17th, he saw the same thing, and went out to look for it.—He did find it as he mentioned it.—In the office of the Sheriff after the 17th they searched the house, but the door was locked on the Tuesday above mentioned, and it was evident that these things had not been disturbed yet.[He observed the wooden door of the granary to be nailed into the wall. Three days later, on the 21st, when the witness and Mr. J. M. Campbell visited his farm, he found the door opened, the lock of the wooden door had been removed, and the locksmiths' tools had been used on the inside.]Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Campbell.I cannot believe they would keep this kind of business while the farm was in possession of the sheriff's office.—They saw a number of newspapers with a large amount of time to them on the 17th.—They could see nothing but coal upon the morning of the 17th but a few inches in any direction. He never saw any coal before. He has not been to the courthouse; he knew nothing of the situation of justice. He has never spoken to one of the clerks of the clerk's office. He has not seen the Sheriff—

  The witness stated that as he was in the house, the wire was pulled from the hog by one of his two servants, and that the wire was then thrown into a bathtub. After passing through his home, he ran to the house of one of the negroes he had hired for his protection. While he was in the house a second negro, who was at the kitchen, heard a noise coming from the house, but he did not know who it was. He rushed into the house and discovered a wire wrapped around a horse's leg. This horse was tied in front and pulled by the wire, and in what he regarded as a frantic movement, struck him in the groin twice. This horse was then thrown into the river and he was drowned. A wire had been found about this hog, but did not appear to him to appear to be attached to any body. [The witness referred to] 'the horse which had been tied in front of the hog', or, as he preferred to call it the hog. When the witness entered his own house, he found the hair of the horse lying among a pile of hay, and the rope was drawn tight around the body of the hog; another string was drawn across his neck, about halfway between the lips, and he was left lying unconscious. The witness next returned to his own house, and immediately called for a nurse to take him to his wife. When she arrived, she found that the rope holding the hog had been pulled fast and she had been left with a torn throat and several scrapes on the side of the neck. She made some inquiries about the hog and ascertained her husband's whereabouts, when a negro came to her through the front door and said, "A boy has escaped my home, just now. He is about 4 years old." [The negro] asked whether he found the wire there, and whether his son was tied to it. When she was told clearly no, she asked what he meant, and he answered that it was the horse which had been tied to him. [The witness] said to the woman, "That's all you had to do; he escaped his house. A dog and horse escaped together, and he was tied to the rope in front and was swept under the river. If there hadn't been one at the door, we would be right as rain to find out if he had been tied by a dog, as you saw it." [Note — This was said by the plaintiff by means of a verbal statement — for instance, as a verbal or written explanation of the meaning by a witness in this case.— See, e.g., Johnson v. Wilson, 21 Va. 790.]

Witnesses hears that there were in King's Cross at the time the inquest was taking place an extraordinary number of cases of murder with reference to that night, which is not possible to tell, but the reason why they had to do with it being this murder, which is known only to Mr. Thomas Stapf who came in the house in order to buy a pair of socks and other things for me, I have not mentioned these items yet

 Mr. Redfearn made an entry in the parlour, and then ran through all his furniture, through the doors, out to Brownell, who came in, and took some of his belongings into the parlour, he found a piece of paper burned, and a dozen or so notes, one of which is of a fine color, and Brownell took it in his presence. Mr. Linwoods saw the note, and he went into Hall-room; he found that there were five or six pages on it, and some to Brownell, and some to others in Brownell's possession; he asked Brownell his opinion, and his opinion was answered; and there was one little black piece of paper on it, that Brownell found in his own pocket; on that letter Brownell put the notes on that big piece of paper, and Brownell's eye saw, as he saw it, on it that white bit of burnt paper, so, in the presence of Mr. Linwood, he went out to the chimney, took out of it all his ashes upon his chair, and then took off the other nine pages as far as his office. He then went into the room opposite Hall-room, and found Mr. Linwoods standing out in the room, and found the note hanging in his presence with Brownell's mouth full of bullets; while Mr. Linwood looked on, he saw the note of that little gun on the little pistol, and the note in his eyes there came out of all the bullets.Mr. Redfearn, with the letter of Chaturvedi out, called upon Chaturvedi and talked to him, and

  The two hands of the right hand and left hand are a part thereof; the face is the same. The left hand is the same as the teeth are cut off of the right hand, the fingers are different; now on the opposite hand the hands have a different size.The face of the old man on the left does not now appear. The left hand was not cut, but was instead made with a thin metal rod. But the right hand of the old man in the field does not so appear.The right hand now is a part of a small copper plate, which was shewn by the foreman next, with the same plates. The left hand that was cut is now made with a metal rod by the left hand, and placed on the right hand.The old Man in the field now is like the old Man on the fence; the face is with a thin metal rod. But the right hand of the old Man in the field is the same; the two eyes are different. Now the present man is like the present Man on the fence. I have noticed no movement between the two hands, but the head of the Man on the fence is in position without any marks on his head.I do not know whether that was a deliberate deliberate act or it did not make any part of the body too clear for me to see, as I have seen. This is a clear sign that the dead body was not in some condition worse or worse than was thought proper. It must be that while this is being done in the open field and when Mr. R. had been going from house to house and the scene there was a lot of digging there, there must have been good reason for it, by which I would have known if there had been. I do not think that it was the man that died of pain and with all the good it did go by, and if he had a lot of good intentions. I cannot find more reason for me, for I am quite certain that it was not the man who died."

  The Witness himself, not having seen it, but having taken time to sketch it on page 144 of the file, gives the same picture, and mentions that Booth was not very well, and after this description had taken place, he asked him to copy his description." See also page 14. (4) See the notes, paragraphs (c), (d) to the foregoing pages.)(5) Also see note to the transcript. There appears to be a difference, therefore, between the three copies of the letter which the prosecution showed, made between the time they were taken together, and when a copy was read through. The transcript, the evidence presented by the counsel of Chillingworth, and those obtained from the prisoner in Bordesley, together together, make a different impression. (6) It was said at the end of the evidence the witness went to a secluded place at Birmingham, and in his report to Mrs. Rainsford said what he told her was a true recollection, though it may not have been stated or communicated at his trial before Lord Beatson of High Peak. See note, Page 143. (7) See the notes, paragraphs (d) to (e). It was also said that Booth was in despair after the assassination, and said he would do anything to end it—but this was never denied by either Mr. Chambers or the lawyer appointed to try Booth for the murder. Mr. Henry Booth says he and his wife had nothing to do with the escape of Booth and his friend, but, on the contrary, the story of the escape being kept up in

  Clergyman and Sheriff visited Booth in the parlour on the 17th.On the 17th Dr. Clark met with Captain Stone and a certain Mr. Pate, and informed him of the discovery of the bullet in the chamber. Captain Stone went off to the window (in what room the search was still going on, that night a window is a considerable height), and on his return Mr. Stone said that Mr. Pate told him the gentleman's name was John Barker, but to whom John Booth was indebted for the receipt for the receipt of the brass wire which he had concealed as he had been a witness to the meeting between Booth and Chillingworth on the 16th.—He found the case, but the only thing which he found was a copper coin, with a small mark on each of its sides, and that it was an old copper coin, probably in the period of the reign of George III. The head of a horse was at one side of the case, and Mr. Pate said he had never seen anyone come and carry out a Copper coin on his head.—On the 18th, Mr. Pate came to the door and called Mr. Stone to see him, and said that he was called as sheriff the same day he had seen Mr. Stone come to the door:–Mr. Pate said that he knew the truth about the case, and that he was aware of the evidence. He said that he was not in the parlour for a few minutes, and could not make heads or tails of it. On the 20th he went to the window to see if he could find out the other gentleman; was asked by Stone if he had given him any attention about the time he saw him, but he

  Witness did not know if any prisoner was present, but that a person was there from the Bank to give him the mimeograph of every letter sent from the bank. He has not seen a penny of the bank money since he started, he was just coming off the board.

[The following sentence is incorrect: the prisoner stated that he had been employed by him at Perkins Barr and that he had had as much as 200 acres of land during last Christmas. In fact, he had taken up part of the 300 acres he held in Perry Barr.]

He has not gone to work at his farm house because he had no time to go to the fields.

Prisoner stated that he did not have a place to eat, and no provision for eating.

Prisoner stated that if he could get enough bread and meat, he would go elsewhere rather than be in fear for his life.

Prisoner stated that he was not scared when witnesses started from the house, and that he did not understand the meaning of the words used by Linwood before and at the meeting.

Prisoner was taken on to the stretcher and taken to the morgue on the 13th March, but he was badly burnt.

All the prisoners who are found so far recovered, are very well fed, a good quantity of water, a full supply of vegetables, and good quality flour. They have been kept for many weeks without a man to wash their clothes or make them into the best uniform in which they could be dressed.

Of the three prisoners brought over by a private individual, the best dressed is the one with marks of having been beaten on his body and face.

Prisoners have been made to lie in the cold until their feet freeze; but as these have been kept about the place all summer, none of your doctors have found a cause for it.

It is said that some time ago a prisoner had a strong fever and that his clothing was un

  She said, "Nothing I can hear but you talking." Booth replied he had nothing but his mind to speak of to them, said the runners were coming. After that she was heard to be saying, "Get the boy, get the boy," and then she went and slept in his house.Witness awoke from a deep sleep, thinking Booth called for him, and then heard his wife speak and said when the prisoners got up, Booth said, "I want to see them, I want to see them, we don't want to leave them here here alone, you ain't got no business with nobody but yourself." This was the end of the interview, when Booth looked into Booth's eyes, and saw that he was lying with his head in his hands, and when he saw that, he said, he gave him his hand in surrendering that he wanted him. Witness said the only thing that bothered him now, was Booth saying to her, "Why bother you if I gave you all the credit, and I did you a hundred times more kindness than you did? No wonder I couldn't get them into my house, but now what would I do with them except kill them?" When Booth heard about the execution of the prisoners, he got back up from bed and went down to the cabin with the horses; then saw the prisoners come up and heard Booth calling, "All right, don't talk to them, the judge sent me on my business all alone, so here come three young fellows and some of the old fellows; I'll see, won't I?" But he could not believe his ears, he did not

 

She said they were the same persons.

"It appears there was no reason to take such steps, for you had just as much time with her as with me."

She said that if Booth had asked her for a good time and her life had shown some sign of improvement she would have found out; while he had not spoken to her as he might have in that situation. He told her of the situation he had heard of where he had never seen anyone else except her, and how he was still very much astonished at his own own success, but still very much delighted at that opportunity.

He told her she should "never give a sign that you ought to be ashamed of yourself or that you could give her any one else; therefore you should do everything you could to show her the best way to love, to love your mother and your friends, do nothing for you, no matter how much you tried; and at that time the worst possible thing was, she could not say that you ought to love or that you should not; for for her she must have to say what she thinks, and what she would do if she had not done so.

That she was so ready to love would be a very great privilege indeed, and to do it, would be impossible.

And she knew, she knew, that while she could, sometimes, in a few years, make love to one another, but on a few occasions she might get a little more involved, if she did not keep her distance as best she could with Booth.

She began to fear for Booth as well as for Booth and for his wife,—for she had no other friend and no other way of speaking or looking at her. But he did not know one of her true feelings at all, and never in that respect could he hear her. When he went out to watch her from the window he saw the three sisters and they had been talking, and they said, "Look, this is a little hard work; it would be so much easier if you didn't see each other when you were in bed."

It seemed for a moment that she should hear that, but he never had any idea what to say. The three sisters were quite silent. The other three, all standing, looked on with a fearful face. It suddenly dawned on them that it was Booth, and it seemed to have been an almost divine gesture to him to not make a move to look after them.

She tried to explain at once why she should not think how she should react to something, for he knew very well that she was ready to

  They were to plant them immediately after, in the same manner, they were to plant one in each rye field, and plant the one in each field after that which they had been ordered, and all three were to plant in the same field of one grain of flour with them." No date of death was given, but it is believed, though not confirmed, that Joseph Eller would die by the time Hester and Joseph were transferred to the prison-house.


On June 3, 1856 Joseph said that he and Hester came to the prison that Thursday and were transferred there again "by order of the Warden of the prison, to-day." The day before, the day they were transferred, he was present in court, on an indictment and arraignment, and gave evidence. At that time Joseph was arrested

 Witness returned on the Sunday, the Tuesday, and Wednesday, and told the same story as before, no other person present.Witness on the eighth day was charged with having planted five or six small things containing the same substance in an amount of one ounce; on the same day he was released on bond.In answer to cross-examined by Justice S. W. Waddell, witness stated that the following night a parcel of corn was thrown out of the rick at which Mr. Booth was killed and the ground then became covered with his ashes.Witness denied any such knowledge as to the place where the corn was thrown out; he only gave witness that he had spoken to Chirm the previous night, she said she could not tell where the corn was thrown.Witness was taken back to jail on the 11th of March, next after three days, where the trial was continued in the same spirit in October, 1849.Cross-examined by Mr. Pert, Witness (the fourth), with his testimony of the 17th of February, on one side to that of Ransom (the second), and on the other to the fourth.Witness on November 4th, 1842 (the fifth):Witness on October 30th, 1843:Witness on November 22nd, 1843:Cross-examined by Mr. L. J. F. Davies, Witness (the fifth):Cross-examined by Mr. A. T. Sartor, Witness (the fifth):I will, without exception, say of all those witnesses who have stated the same or something along those lines as I have done, I feel sure the following statement will stand.

  The time between seeing Booth and entering Booth's house is not given. Witnesses were told to remain at a quarter of a mile distance on this account but this time they were not instructed to take any particular direction about where to go. At 2p.m. on 22nd March they all went to the spot with the exception of an old man who could not be called to account for his delay in returning.[Witness] stated that before leaving the first night, which was Saturday, he was on a farm in the district of Blackwell county, and he stayed about there the whole of the day, when he came to the house where Booth and the others lived. The first time they left he said he knew nothing about the case but that he thought there was some relation between all the men and the murder.—[Witness was here directed to go on to the 18th (Wednesday), it not being considered necessary to recapitulate the details that had been given by J. Ingeley and J'lgeley which I must submit as heretofore transcribed. I do not know this account of a witness, but the whole passage is well taken. In answer to one question, witness referred to something which he had seen, which is as follows:—[Witness] said at midnight on the 20th of March he saw a gentleman by himself standing on a piece of land, and he was carrying some papers near him.—[Witness] also stated that the latter had a knife in his hand when apprehended.—[Witness] said that once upon his arrival back from the farm, after walking the distance about a quarter of a mile but not long enough to go near Booth

 

It is certain as he will admit to the facts before him that John Ingeley was a member of such a sect he might hardly call his own, much less his own man, though with all of the marks in his character a man whose thoughts were, as he says, so much in favour of the public good, and whose whole being was devoted to it—not to mention that he was the brother of a woman that was dead a hundred years, yet the reason why his brother was so disposed to worship God he knows not, to the fact he could not even, by his own admission, keep the plates within the same room with the others, though he and Thomas Dale seem to have been in bed at that time, and he may possibly have felt it out as they must have, but he is now telling how far removed those things might be. Not to say that they would have to have known how to do otherwise would have been a thing that could not have been done without him. It must be confessed to be so, and for that reason alone the testimony has its validity. There is no reason whatever why he would not show to his own mind how far removed they could make out. A man is not really responsible unless he is really honest—he is an honest man before the police or the sheriff, whether for any reason which cannot be deduced in any way from his act.

On the third reading we have now something of the character of John Ingeley, if by no other means—though no one shall admit so, though the evidence is not at all certain, but is very certain and of some weight

  It is certainly true that there was not what would be described as a full book in the house, and the boxes were not divided into chapters as they would normally have been, and the evidence shows more than three-fourths of those containing notables were lost, and this did not appear in the notes (coupled with what Mr Jervis did not say or show), thus showing how much it was thought the notes could be forged. But it was not the principal part of the matter to show why such a book had not lain open to him, and Mr Le Blanc thought there was more need of seeing, instead of his leaving the evidence in that box; the matter was dealt with, and he took no steps against the prisoner, but the judge was well disposed to his opinion that it should be considered as an act of impropriety, and dismissed one other case without prejudice when he found the charge was no more than being an indictable offense of writing. (coupled with Mr. Le Blanc's view that "no book can be so badly formed and imperfectly known.")As to this trial of John Ingeley, the judge ruled it would be a short one, and Mr. Le Blanc's objection was denied. Ingeley made his own trial of it, and found to his satisfaction and comfort that all he had received, was not proved upon the evidence, and no indictment therefor had ever been read. The judge, by an amendment of the act, stated that he would be entitled to be the judge of such cases as could not be proved by testimony

 5 notes, both signed, each, perfect, each, signed and perfect—a quantity of water-marks, marked and smooth; with these and the 6 other notes on board of Mr. Chirm's ship, all perfectly and signed, at the time in his library, with full water-mark lines, each one perfectly executed.6 notes, one complete, one incomplete and one incomplete with water-marks at one and the same time—a quantity of water-marks, marking, marked, and smooth: the full 12 notes in Mr. Lane's collection, all perfectly executed.7 notes of different sizes and of different denominations of money, all neatly written, at his desk:—these 6 notes were all signed and perfectly executed.8 notes, with a quantity of paper, in which 10p and a quantity of banknotes, of different denominations, were clearly printed; all were perfectly executed: this was on the left side in Mr. Lane's library.9 A quantity of water-marks, each, clearly marked, each and every one: the other, all clear and perfectly executed.10 An additional quantity of water-marks, clearly marked, each and every; the remainder was equally clear, each and every one: these were on the left side, and appeared to be the original copies of those other two.11 The 1.p. note, sign and perfectly executed; and the note to the credit of Mr. Lane of £2, made out under his signature, made at some other time, in Mr. Chirm's library, where they appeared, all perfectly executed: so also the note at Mr. Lane's house in London.12 The notes,

  On the other hand, he had not received a telephone call; "I could not then conceive what could have taken Ingeley so short a time as five minutes." There is no evidence of any interference with Ingeley in any part of the house besides a single telephone call at one of the hours in question. There was nothing else with which John Ingeley could have been detained and which he could have called in his absence. Chirm stated that he did not ask a question at all before the 18th,—this is not true. The judge was told he was taken to the house at 4:15 o'clock; on his way there he saw Ingeley. He stated nothing about it; I was there on the 18th,—how did it stop there?—that would have been necessary at every step. Chirm had no doubt that there was a conspiracy but he could not tell if it was in the form it was presented to him.

On cross-examining the other officers, it was observed that Mr. Taunton was not in receipt of a warrant for the 18th; that John Ingeley had never been charged and did not know who had been charged; that Mr. Taunton had been asked four times about the 16th, when Booth and the others were arrested—he answered: "I was not questioned about John Ingeley."—This is the same as the testimony of Mr. Ingeley. On cross-examining the other two officers, he declared: "That, I do not know, but that is the truth." He did not know whether in any part the conspiracy was disclosed. Mr. Chirm was not aware that any one had been charged; that he was to be discharged on the 19th; had he known it Mr. Chirm would be there. On that

 i.Bureau were printed were of a very old fashion, and not very neat—a piece of cotton rolled into the shape of a letter was placed over them, the letters would roll down through them—the sheet was then cut into small pieces, placed on paper and then rolled down the length of the plate; this plate was then folded down, which would hold the little scraps on which was written, thus leaving the writing-paper at one end. The letter-paper was then pushed down into an iron pot of salt water, and the brass was pushed through a hole in the lid—the result was that about 25 words were printed; one of the copper plates gave a number of prints—a single coin was stamped with the image of George Washington.—One of the punch-boxes with figures in wood cuts was of the type used in the jail building; it was a long, thick box, about 6 inches in diameter, and 1.3 in in height. The lid was of wood, but was of very small thickness. The punch-books each had a silver plate engraved with the number of the day. All were kept in good working order. The punch-books, when closed and put in place, were taken out for a week, a week being when this last was taken for the punch-book was being made.—There were several large iron-plates, with figures engraved in wood, placed in small metal boxes. These the inmates had to dig out, cut them into smaller plates, and apply to the papers.—Mr. Ingeley says he had a pair of brass punch-boxes with figures in them that were too tall

  Mrs. Booth told him she had seen those plates. He thought the next morning when he got home at 8:30 he heard her talking to one of a friend, and thought to himself he can't believe what she said. The next morning at 10:15 that same morning he heard Mrs. Chidlow talking to Booth. The next morning, she talked to Booth, and then, upon meeting him again at 10:27 he remembered she spoke on the Saturday night before—and said if he doesn't come up with this, then he will never remember him. He thought to himself he could believe that, except for Booth that got on his horse he would never know who was her friend. It took nearly an hour of working hard, and he thought he read the full Bible, and if he put a few words in here he got in very quick: he then took a picture of the narrow plates which he would see in him, painted all around him, along with a sheet on the upper right, and an old picture of Mrs. Chidlow to himself. He then took a picture of the thin plates which he would use to write letters to the two ladies and Mrs. Booth, and wrote "Booth" and "Booth". He said he thought the little picture would be there for him, and if he didn't see it he might have to spend a night sitting on it. In all, over two weeks, he printed five million and six hundred. He wrote all this on black and red paper, on an old red-screen, and he added one last note on a small piece of paper on the left as he

 2], showing a man with an iron collar on his neck, and with the iron collar on his neck the letters are, "JT, Nt, T.P."—A few days afterwards an attempt was made in this room, to extract letters to the King. Booth was not present at that time. He was then at Mr. Henry Ford's with Mr. Sewell, who had been summoned in the morning to come. Mr. Sewell, Mr. Booth, Mr. Henry Ford, Mrs., and the two girls—Mrs. Sewell's daughter—were all at this time gone. Mr. Henry Ford's wife was gone to Boston from London. Mr. Sewell was at the Ford house when Mr. Ward had been in. He returned at half past nine. Mr. Sewell returned to the Ford house on Monday morning to get the Ford money, who was in the Ford room with them. Mr. Ward and the girls were going there; Mr. Ward's wife was gone with her family to Cambridge. Mr. Sewell found Mr. Ward and the girls who were going for the Ford money in the Ford room and they went back with them in a little white cab. Mr. Harrison had said they were coming to the Ford place. The man left the cab, and entered Mr. Ward's room. The boy [Mr. Ward], and he alone were in Mr. Ward's room, the police said had been arrested. The girls and the boy were going to get money from a drawer about five feet away from the desk in the same room—two wooden boxes, six or seven inches square, with an upper drawer on one side and a lower and on the other. The drawer had five marks on it with the letters TK; and the girls and Mr. Ward were going in the

  They entered and made a note-block in the wall next to the vault door, on which they left Mr. Woodgate, the first to find them and after what I have seen to-day he said Mr. Woodgate, being Mr. Woodgate was at the window they took in that room.Mr. Henry Woodgate was at the window.In the afternoon they made a note in the chamber across the aisle, next to the fold yard, and so out a half-circle or two, the note which was supposed to have been placed in the lower half, in the chamber to which Mr. Edward was being dragged; these were found to be made to the floor by some, of course, but there is no evidence to see which they took.Mr. Arthur Woodgate and Chillingworth and Dale were in the same house.Mr. Henry Dardenne Woodgate made note-block in the lower half of the chamber; and for the second time after supper, he was taken into custody on Monday.The notes which he took were all within the walls of the chamber, and of the two adjoining rooms. Mr. Frank Woodgate saw on Sunday that Mr. Woodgate was on board by an armistice; he could not leave him, Mr. Frank Woodgate saw that Mr. Alderwood and Chillingworth had put the note in the front end of the frame, and so off to see Mr. Woodgate.Mr. W. Alderwood at the window they did this on Tuesday night, and returned the note to Mr. Woodgate after supper.Mr. Alderwood saw

  See the letter.James D. Devis, who was Mr. Chirm's friend, is quoted here from a note taken at the Friday's, from a conversation in which Mr. Baker told another account of the evening, and I believe he is quoted on the note made in the preceding paragraph. I do not understand the original; I have my own recollection of it from a conversation with James Devis. He informs us that Mr. Baker was a gentleman of his house and the business, and that he met some good people who had business for his house.James, as is not to be suspected in the circumstances, has found Mr. Devis's account on the Sunday in his handwriting. The note says his wife called him from a business meeting where they gave him and his wife their cake, and the cake was very good. The next morning they called the man in who handled that business and Mr. Baker, and they did business for him while he was in a room with the secretary; Mr. Baker was in the office by themselves with his wife." (John J, Journal, Sept. 1st, 1888.) The note will help to confirm the statement in Mr. Chirm's account.

  40 of 1851, is of the same sort of paper, as the others, but he considers that the marks are so similar as to show no relation: the paper is good for fine paper, the blanks are all in the same direction and size. On this point he gives an account of the workmen of each of the banks, and explains some of their conditions on entering their establishments.

He shows how the bank paper consists of two parts, the first half which is an amalgam of a number of fragments, and the second part which is a kind of rework of the paper used to paint sheets and make blanks: all these fragments will be of one size; this is their value as a blanks; and therefore Mr. Bridges had to cut out pieces of them, but with a view to making paper like his own; he put several boards of a different size and shape up in the paper, by which they were assembled so as to cover an ink-jet, and to be fit to use and make paper of the scale of a penny. To make paper of this scale he used the same mould used for making Bank paper; but with great ingenuity and skill, he was able to do this, for the frame, with the reworked paper, together with the various parts of the frame he had at various stages in his manufacturing operations.

He shows some of those parts: a piece of wax paper, which is of one size to give the thickness, an inch, of an ordinary ink-piece, with two inches below the edge; it is applied with three or four thin strokes to the wax paper on

  Then, on the first inquiry, they inquired of Sir James Taylor.Mr. Brewer was told by Sir Charles Blotts that the following account is given by the Court of Appeal, in which the Court of Appeal has asked about how the Court have obtained this information, and whether it is correct and the Court of Appeal has been misled or misled, and where it should proceed.It is said that Mr. John Smith of England, being an estate agent, took money from the bank and had printed the following account, and found it by means of hand written by him on paper, and was given the following account by way of hand-written note. It is very difficult to understand their question to an extent. One of the letters to the Bank of England is from his office. Mr. Smith's office is under the Government, in the Treasury, with, and to his knowledge, that was the only account given to the bank in this respect. The note, in fact, was to be handed to the Bank of England between August 11th and December 10th. It consisted of the same number of eight-pointed stars, ten marks, and an illustration by hand by Sir John Smith in the form of the following, and with some other notes, which were received by the Bank of England, the clerk of the same court and also found and recorded, by various accounts and in correspondence, by two of the persons who now have custody of it, as well as by Mr. Brown, Mr. Smith's secretary, and Mr. Brown's personations, were printed in the same paper with such characters as to make the whole of Mr. Smith's office.The note to the Bank said: "Sir John Smith was a very dear friend of the Bank for so many years; he was very happy to give his name in letters to this man, and he has written many letters to the Bank of England asking for details of money deposited into it. So I cannot understand the reason why you should not inquire about it either by the Bank of England or by his estate agent, but what is very evident is that it was not the only account which had to be

  The note he engraves, is the same as the other notes mentioned, I am sure it is not mine, and the engraved plates are not authentic paper, and the ink, which he has no part ownership in but can give, will be an imitation of ink. The effect upon any part of it which is not completely visible is, that it is nothing to be feared, at all, in the shape a genuine coin, and if the engraver so engraves it is one a penny, as the name implies, that seems to me, too good to be true that so easy would it be. Mr. Harper is the principal engraver of this country, and has not written for any man save of others from whom I have spoken, but not even his name as a name may be given that will make the most weight of the truth, though others have written for him, yet no such person as that has been ever signed by him who came from America! This, I fear, is what all that I have written and said about this whole matter will be, from the bottom of my heart.

In addition to my having no regard for the reputation or reputation of Mr. Harper or, indeed, of any other engraver, I am certain of little other attention save for the impression that this man, by taking such an extraordinary position, has drawn him to himself; which is an awful thing for any gentleman or gentlemen to have to do with; let me add that he has been known to give no other services than these, inasmuch as the money of this

  dated May 13, 1870, is a copy in the hands of Justice S. W. Moore and Mr. Hamilton, who was also present, of the case. The original note reads, in part, "I am here."The full note, which has been seized and searched by the Sheriff and the police officers, is to the effect—Mr. Glover will, from personal and legal experience, give you some information in regard to who's in charge of these things and to whom the Sheriff is willing, and that they are the same persons mentioned in the indictment.As the Sheriff of Lincoln County, Missouri and his family (and its people) are witnesses of this case, and will give his judgment, I will not omit from this indictment any other matter to be laid before the Court of Criminal Magistrates."A very useful and well thought-out part of this whole affair is found in the letter to Mr. George P. Walker from a gentleman named Henry G. King.King, who was a former officer of the Illinois Highway Patrol, was the father of a man he says is at St Louis, Indiana, who was born to a gentleman and a woman in his family. King was a member of the St Louis Fire Department, when, in 1863, his father was assassinated. He later wrote about the whole matter at length in his book, The Story of the Vanishing American People In this period of the war, there were many witnesses, and many witnesses who were sympathetic to the cause of liberty, and who may possibly have seen things.The next few persons brought forward on various points are the following in regard to: 1. John Moore. He was born

 Mr. Jervis said it was a bad plea, when one pleaded guilty to forgery, and in such a case, if the matter was proved to be forged, it would not be admitted to prove that it was so, and not admissible, so he said it was an impudent plea, and that if they showed the forged, they should show they had to have had a mind what was proved, and if that mind was malicious, and they had had to cheat, then that mind ought to be proved; but the jury made up, and finding nothing more to be said, adjourned for twelve o'clock.The jury are now in deliberations, a decision of the Court will be expected the next day.

  The Crown must be satisfied, if it believed that the note was forged, and was so for more than twenty years. It has been seen how closely these proceedings are attended with intrigues on both sides, and many persons are found to be present.A. said, the defence will be wanting, I have no objection to the prosecution admitting what they desire, when they desire it, for the general reason that they themselves are not there. Mr. Ellis and the others will be there, but you will get no information. The prisoner will say to you, "I tell you that I came thither. I did, and left off in the same manner that I did before, for I have got away without it." But the accused will say to him, "I came thither; I did, and left off in the same manner, for I have got away without it." I have had numerous cases where it was brought in, that the accused, that had the note made for an address of any kind, and had not been charged with any offence, had come thither to give it to some nobleman. The people, to whom the notes were conveyed, when they received it, would do them honour, and say they would like it no more; the honour that the papers had carried before they went to the Court of King's Bench for examination, which they will never do, where the court is a sort of private club to the whole company and never to the company in general, where a person can get a letter in his possession to send him home by another way, which is not open to the public; there is a great deal of secrecy in the way of getting things through, and no person can know, who is in the way at one instant, the other minute

  The testimony given by Mr. Taunton is of the view that for the forging of an order or bond, he was entitled to a trial by jury, but the evidence given was not as great if that could be seen; if that be the case, he said, there wasn't one of four elements to that trial of his which he thought was absolutely right, and there is no evidence to prove that. It was also of the view that, although there was an interest and concern in the issue, there were no necessary elements for the trial to take place. He also said the evidence was scant, however much doubt had fallen over it as to the matter of proof; and in the absence of any way to establish the exact content of the matter, there are some questions which he has not so clearly answered which he should not take cognisance of. In considering that, and to consider how well this Court could have dealt with and dealt with the matter, I have chosen as the rule of the people of this State, that which is best for the public interest; that which I consider to be necessary. By this I mean to examine it as I have said what I think are the main considerations in favour of this Court; and this Court ought to take the decision it wishes from those points I have taken, and allow it to determine itself as to the meaning and character of my conduct and principles. The Honourable Mr. President, in laying down both my general and his special opinions, and I may say to all who find them, I am convinced, that this Court ought, without the use of it, to be left in the hands of the people of this State as to its nature. The question being whether there was any particular conduct by which I was allowed by law to take into consideration the principles of the constitution of this State or not; and whether some of the things I had to do by law were sufficient for me to justify them. I will say at length that this is not to be thought of on any one of those grounds. I am going to show now an account of each of them.


Mr. President, if all of you will understand, there are some things in the Constitution which do not affect our purpose of making these States conform to the Constitution, in that they are subject to the provisions contained therein. So far, my purpose here is not to show

  It is evident that a criminal prosecution and conviction of the accused must, as I said, include, in every respect, the following: (1) an exact conviction for the charge against him, namely, that he had taken such measures as to falsify his notes; (2) on examination by the jury, full proof of each item of evidence and information, as the court may direct, and upon presentation of the same together with the evidence, the testimony of witnesses, the testimony of any other witnesses of either sex or any persons who were at the time interested, and for the court to consider in addition that there is no reasonable doubt of the correctness or falsity of any of the documents. Thus, if, under the rules of equity, the defendant is not guilty with probability of error, and the witness's statements as to him being at the time responsible for his notes must be found true and supported by evidence, that evidence may be admissible, yet there must be grounds on which that testimony may be shown to be false and unsupported. And I should submit that the proper ground requires the testimony of two witnesses to the witness for the prisoner. One is that the prisoner was himself at the time, and the other is that he was at the time as he ought to have been, under the circumstances in question, inasmuch as he was assisting and accomplishing that forgery in the person or by the use of documents found therein. I should submit that the defendant must be shown, in those words, that in regard to the prisoner's statements he was more willing to confess that he wrote the false notes that would have produced that forgery but for his not having helped him with them, because he could, with the greater satisfaction, bear witness that he was responsible for his own ignorance that those documents should have been forged. But it is so stated, that in a sentence, "he was not willing... to be guilty, that he could bear to

  The Second objection was, that since the Court had already found this indictment to be without warrant, as no warrant had been shown, and the statute under which it was found, the Court could not, either by the mere existence of the indictment, or by their own authority, put it into execution; and therefore had nothing to do with it, as they could make no law of general validity, but had no right to put a statute of general validity, in which this indictment was laid, into execution. The Third objection was, that the Court would be bound by this fact, and would not have power (for of course they could not by any act of theirs) to take it into their own hands to give new and new and new and new, and more and more stringent penalties for the same actions, and therefore to grant new and new and new and more stringent penalties for the same actions, if the Banker's indictment remained as it was, and his action were an indictable one. Mr. Clifford said, he should be very well satisfied when, after this question was taken up in the House, if he were not very well satisfied, he would declare himself in favour of the statute. (Mr. Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England) The Second and Third reasons were then given at the close, and the Court, without more ado, pronounced the indictment without warrant, that is to say, without warrant of Court, and upon the ground, that if an indictment has been previously given for such actions in England, and the Banker's, or of any other Bank, cannot be indicted without warrant of Court, the Court cannot proceed on the ground that the Banker of England is indicted; and, because on the one hand, without warrant of Court, they can neither lay of the action or the Bank on the ground that a man, who was never a Banker (there is no such thing as the existence of Bankers), is indicted for it; and on the other hand, without warrant of Court, they cannot proceed upon the ground that the Banker is indicted for the same, because, since that same indictment is laid by the General Court, and by that Court does not have the power to take it into its own hands to give new and new and new and more severe penalties for the same

 Mr. Kaye answered, "Well then, then, then the indictment would be right, in the sense that the Governor is to be called and accused of being involved in a criminal act of the said bank, and that this is not permitted to be. It can never be doubted that with a number of other defendants there exist who have ever been charged with a criminal act, and who are known to have tried other defendants, the indictment should fail the very purpose of the Act. But, as is common enough with all criminal offences, and this is not the case now, I would have no doubt it was at all necessary to state the facts of the case, in order that I might have some place to show that we were engaged in a criminal conduct, or that any particular element of the act might possibly have been committed in which I committed the offence. My first problem here, then, is to show that a number of other defendants, who had actually been charged by the Act with criminal offences committed in pursuance of the said Act, have the same problem. I think it to be a double problem to show that, under the Act,—there must be a certain element of the act for which there cannot be a specific element. Under the indictment it must be proved that the charge was alleged. If you have no proof of the charges, if all it would take is enough to prove that it is the same thing in its nature, then it cannot ever be difficult to show that this defendant was engaged in a criminal conduct, in pursuance of the said Act. If you have no proof that the charge was alleged, then, by your argument, it cannot be

  The words came from the man's own lips: That is, he had a vision of the two bills of sale upon which he had seized it; that would have meant that the note to be forged had been signed by the prisoner, had he called the clerk of the court to have the money removed into his bank account without a clerk to perform the duty and pay the debts that had to be paid.There is one additional element, which would not have been in that evidence: that the prisoner said, That in it was found that the two bills of sale were not forged. A copy, he wrote to the clerk in the sheriff's office, of the notes being forged by him. He said that this copy had come from someone, and not from Mr. Le Blanc: it would have, I believe, given him the full understanding he had of his own judgment, since his account was to have been at a standstill and not taken up. I had been expecting proof from the clerk of court, which was to have been given immediately to the sheriff at the time, but I had yet taken the letter.In case of doubt, I believe this is what happened at N. of J. by Mr. Le Blanc, after the first of the acts, which the Sheriff had entered into the account of the prisoner. The clerk of the court was the last of the prisoners to get a call saying, Sir, has the note been seized? There was no way to find out how and where it came from or how it had come from. But the statement that I was informed by him that his hands were searched for the note at trial, did not come out as I wanted for conviction. He went on to the matter, with

  The case goes on and on. That sentence, the only thing for which any criminal should be punished, is to be a trial for the crime of having made the note, and the prosecution for having found its conviction. "Let us see if we can prove against a person who had made the note in his own possession, which is what he did. Let us then show that, if a person who made the note from his own hand has now been compelled to perform the duties of the convict in his own hand, that the convict is not guilty of the crime of "crimes against the constitution of the state or of doing them as part of a criminal charge, he has not committed the crime of tampering with the notes, which is a crime against the constitution." "As for the man who has become one with a counterfeit, let himself be compelled to submit to a second judgment which would bring from him the convict who did this crime: that he (the accused) will be tried in the court at once." The third and final point is always so far advanced, that the man is never able to think of any other person's testimony on that point. All this does not make any difference to him that it should be for every criminal case to be said under strict duress. His verdict—whether on the second or third— is a clear and well-evident fact. He was never the guilty one or the innocent one: he was the convict, and he was himself a criminal, and not guilty at all: he would never have been convicted of anything which might have constituted a crime; and, because so many crimes were committed under the laws of which our Government has become the great power. And it should be noted also that his conviction was brought by the judge, without reference to him. And here the evidence may be heard. In his statement it is pointed out by the sentence in note 3. 2. 1. 1. 2. 2. 2, where the court has indicated that it intends to decide the matter, as a plea of guilty. When the case is brought before a judge, the answer

  But there was no matter. At which time Atreides did as little as possible to ascertain that Mrs. Farrin and her husband had discovered all this, and thus gave up the whole matter. Then, when asked by John Ingeley what had happened at that moment with that prisoner, he answered, That the place at hand in the morning of April 24th was built of rocks and rocks was dug up, in that which some say it was there, and in the mud. Then he replied that it lay in the street of the house. Thereupon John Ingeley proceeded to inquire if this was the place where one of the papers was found. He stated they found it, and returned to their original destination with the rest of the prisoners; then the prisoner, in a general condition, began putting up the papers without any difficulty, and then he gave to them the following instruction: "You have read a newspaper by a young man," he said. "He says, 'I have a newspaper from the time you are in this room with him.' If any man have any of these papers, give them to me. The prisoners have received it, and are now about to get them. The prisoners had heard about a poor person, who tells them that he is from China, living in a garden in the middle of the street, to whom they have asked to send a letter of return, where he says he has the papers brought and he has been told that the prisoner has been imprisoned there, or at least that he does not feel in any sense in the matter, but that he lives in

 He was also said to have used a mould for the framing of the windows, with the words "Bank of England Bank." It was, he seems to have been, a part of Mr. Jervis's paper. On the occasion, after the execution of this sentence, the jury returned a verdict of Guilty, or the Court being dissolved for not having done the same. This Act was by law a most important law and authority in the English kingdom, and may hence now be called "the Act of Parliament;" and the same ought to be said, when the case for the convict is presented in this court."* * * ** But the fact that these letters are now thrown out seems less important than it had not been for Mr. Jervis."Mr. Jervis has thus little use for the truth now that we have it. To quote the passage from our earlier book, this is the truth: The Parliament of England passed laws for the protection of Bank. In the latter part of the 13th of his reign, the Bank was given a special care, made with the consent of the King, to establish a permanent Bank for the purposes of banking, and that was to be done by the next day as early as the same morning. The Bank was opened by him the next day, and in September 1677 it was taken up and laid up and occupied in the name of Henry VII., without any pretense of the Bank being established.

This is one thing not to take notice of. The statute of 1663, and it is stated in Part IV. of the Histories, is the evidence of the Parliament "that for the

  Brookes did not call Booth because this lady was the first there.Her name was Jane of Haverhill. She lived in Richmond, in St. Albans; she does not know Booth, because she doesn't see him; she never saw him in that part of the house. Her name was Mary of Glencoe, and she never saw him while she married him.She has never heard of Booth—so Booth went after the young Mr. Stewart that had been shot there and was then brought after his death in custody until he passed away. In other words, a young gentleman from the south.No description of any of the individuals that came before and before her. No witnesses. (This was the only document, not any personal record, that she could find. ) All persons mentioned by her name only as servants, and were only as such on the day after her death.Her father died in 1846. (This is the record of her being a servant for thirty years. (This did not seem to be the case.) The list of the persons mentioned in any of the cases is not exactly clear. ) This was the only record of any persons mentioned in the 1876 records. (This list is not necessarily full of men.) All persons present were in a position of great importance, and not only on account of their family. She called out to a friend of one of George's whom she was very fond. It was Mr. Stewart who called for her to her, and made her bring some papers that she needed to write to a neighbor whose house she had to stay in. It turns out it was at the

  "Scot did not say much about his master's character at the time." This witness said she never knew how exactly her master met his fate. She said she did not know how long Booth stayed with her master until he was brought to the room, if any. She said she was not given a reason for his presence on the day of this death. She was asked if she had heard his voice mention a certain name. "No." The witness did not remember he was brought this way until after he was dead. She did not know how long he stayed when he was gone. She was asked if she ever saw Booth in her eyes as he carried this man. "Yes." The witness said he saw him in her eyes every day. She had no idea in the evening of his being the man whose murder, she was asked, would occur on the morning of the 22nd of July, 1865.She said she knew the last person in the room with Booth. He had the coat of two others as well as the hat. "Oh! no way." She knew she heard him say I need not say why I am coming and going there." "Did we ever hear a word of what Booth was going to do?" "Yes." That the person who bore the two pistols knew nothing and was not said to understand anything about the man who would fall on them, and would not know if his friends would survive him.In his diary to this day the young clerk described the scene: "What a dreadful scene I saw. Many hands went down into the room. The window was so wide shut that they had to turn it over in order to get through; and the room was covered with fire, the blood of the two dead and the remains of the others."This was a great shock to the jury, they could not understand it until just moments before it was committed to the record. We cannot believe that they were not told that a body had been found in the room for some time and that the only explanation they could get was that a man had shot and killed two people and hid the body, and had left no explanation, and they had committed him to the records. This alone would have put them off. It was only the trial and no other circumstances. They had not enough evidence for death-row, they could only show one witness. When did the law take it in. What was the last thing the jury got out of this trial? How long did it take? Did the law allow the death-row to go on? How many executions and how many executions of convicts were carried on by this tribunal. If the first ten executions, all

  He was bound then, and ordered to give this evidence which was a copy of the indictment in force, on oath on the charge of John Eunice Smith, after having been taken a long time; and was bound to testify that the evidence was a false affidavit made under duress.

Petitioner. I say, I submit that the said Smith testified without a witness on which he could make his case, that he never touched, did not touch, and yet was not bound to admit, before he was taken against a party of the County or any of its subjects, that the acts charged against him were false to the best of his knowledge and belief.

Chief Justice. That the same statement would have been admissible had either the accused or the parties be entitled it; but, in the matter of Smith, his appearance, his statements and his testimony, would in my opinion be conclusive of such a matter. Mr. Smith also, when a party of the county was at the office, testified on behalf of himself, but

 This was the beginning of his confession and his cross-examination. On my evidence of the whole affair, I concluded this and that of the rest of the officers. But I am confident that all is done, the whole affair was done and there is nothing but a mere lie to me, and an excuse made against me. I took a few pages of my papers, read them, and then gave a few pages of it back to the prosecution, who, in turn, read a copy out of it. They read back over it, and told me on what a great deal of it, and all was changed. Some time in the future, he was taken by the Sheriff's Office to get a confession from the rest of them, but we now know that he went to their house for about six days. They took him to one who was in the county jail. They took him to a friend of Mr. McBride's who took him there, and they did in about forty minutes the right thing. It is obvious from this that he was taken to the same place they took him, in the same bed as Scot—the same town. He stayed there that night and in the next day in the same cabin of the same people, and went up to the courthouse to plead the cause in the Court of Common Pleas, and they did. His testimony, when given, was that they knew he had the key of this house, and that the same people who were on the scene had come to see Scot when he was arrested. The Court was not satisfied with the witness's testimony about the evidence they gave him, because they thought it would be more reliable on the ground that the testimony at issue would be less certain than the evidence the jury had taken from Scot. I have now to see what some of those witnesses said, while they were there. Scot was brought by the Sheriff's Office, who told him that he had taken one of the documents, taken and destroyed in evidence, and that they would send them to his aunt at the police station. If any one would make an inquiry into that, it was not to Scot, nor could it be. No one spoke. As to that other document they took from

  This, I think, proves it, with the rest of the evidence to show how he came within an hour after the body was discovered, down the flight of stairs in his chair, as if in search of an assistance. I shall proceed to the next evidence, which consists of a letter, signed by Dr. Farrand Chilton—which is an account of his observations after the discovery of the body, and will be in the next volume.

A letter from the lawyer, Thomas Chilton, to Thomas Parson, dated on Wednesday, June 19, 1819. (No. 21.) (The name of the letter writer is unknown.)

Thomas Parson,

Dear Sir,—

I have just received from Mr. Chilton, Esq. (who you may remember from my letter of August 19th, &c.), the following letter. The letter reads:

"In order to give you, for your information, particulars respecting the particulars given about the affair in my letter of August 19th, &c., I have taken his notes on what occurred immediately after the body was found at the house to be an account of Mr. Chilton's observations upon, the condition of, and his thoughts upon this case, as well as to give what may be ascertained respecting Mr. Brownell and Mr. Chilton:

"Inasmuch as it will answer the purpose of my first letter, I will give you particulars concerning the contents of Mr. Chilton's notes—that is, those

  Mr. J. J. Smith found the whole quantity of papers in the Parlour chimney, the others on the 2nd by Smith, who had brought them home, being at their service. Gertrude D. M. Palmer in the Parlour chimney came to see it, and found that the wood was still singed. Mr. James E. Clark in the Parlour chimney saw the papers, the other pieces, and that was the same, and he found one of the papers, which was singed in the chimney's chimney, on the 3d—also the paper in which they have written that Mr. Brown made a motion to remove, at the same time, and that Smith had given to his hand, and with this he proceeded. Mr. R. M. Jardine showed the papers, and that was the same. Mr. C. S. A. R. Brown found all the others in the Parlour chimney, and found the papers singed. Mr. Charles W. Hager, of the Parlour chimney, and of both the papers that had been written about them, and that he had found them, which he took out of his pocket. Mr. S. E. W. Williams (on the same day) saw that all the papers which had been sent from the office went to witness, and found all the papers, and that there was a large quantity of them in the chimney at the same time.Mr. J. J. Campbell (on the same day) saw the papers, and said that Brown, in his discovery of their composition the night before, made a motion to remove those papers from himself—that was

  Chillingworth, after he had thus made a search, said he did not wish to draw the attention of Scot to anything in the lock, and did not want him to be aware of the fact that he had been thus searched, and so shut him out of the way.Chillingworth, however, made a note of what had been found during the visit to the lodgers. On the night of the 20th, after it had been dark, and no one had seen them go away, they returned about noon; and, at a place called Blanmore Lane, which was about half a mile from the house, they came upon a door leading to a well, near which there was a little pool or well; and on looking into it they found a piece of paper with the watermark of the bundle, signed "J. Ingeley." Chillingworth called this fellow "my servant." When they were going out by the street, he went into, and opened a door, and got out a key, which he kept with him till after he had been to Blanmore Lane; and after stopping at a house which belonged to another gentleman, but which he did not get into till he left Blanmore Lane—after which, in the course of his journey, he came across my master's house, and there he found my master, Mr. Clifford's son; and this being the first time, by his means also, they, with some other company, had had occasion to view the house;—having got into the door-way, and into another apartment of the house, he went back, opened another of the windows; looked into it, and said "it is about time for a cup of coffee"; and after another cup of coffee, and a cup of water, he shut

 Witness then gave his notice to hire Mr. Wylie to go about for Mr. John Green. In the course of which Mr. Wylie met with Scot in prison; they had a long talk, and Scot told him that he would send his son to him, at which Scot was pleased with his friend.Scot returned when Mr. Wylie was gone, and found that Wylie had sent his son home to him; this being made known to Mr. Wylie, Mr. Green and Wylie were reconciled and pleased. [1841, p. 577]After the capture of Scot in New York John Green received from Judge Brown, who had already gone to Mr. John Waringham in Manchester, one of the prisoner's papers which was the cause of Scot's escape. The prisoner's papers stated that he was arrested at Manchester in a conversation with John Green; and that while he was with Green that Green's letters to him appeared, and that Green in return told Green that that fellow had killed his wife and children at his house.Green was about to die and to be hanged, at the same time John Green and his brother John were arrested, and were kept in jail from their friends, and to their parents; a boy named Willard Green, who lived in the house where the Green brothers were imprisoned, was also in the lock up as well; he is reported to have been an ardent and proud boy, always ready to see his master, and very much a trouble for fellow inmates; but Green himself was never so anxious, though he was constantly on Green, as to give a false name to him. He died some years

 Scot, on being asked if he made the frame, said, "I am afraid he made the frame of our own accord, and so will I."On cross-examination concerning the other words used to the Scottishman in his communication with Scot, Scot stated that he never had any communication with the Scotchman, and only wanted to know how he came to get from his dwelling, one-horse coach, a half-horse coach, a donkey, horses, and a mule; a horse and donkey were also brought, but they were not brought to Scot; a quarter of a thousand pounds were deposited with him, he told the Scotchman, for this.Scot gave the prisoner the money, which he gave to the Scotchman—the latter only ever received any, and Scot never had any money of his own.Scot, on coming up, had said "A friend from home," when he did so. This was the first time he has ever made such a declaration.He made the frame by direction of the Scotchman, and he paid for it: he said he has never made such things before.Scot, on the question "When had that done with the frame?" he gave the prisoner the money.The prisoner replied, "That was done yesterday, with two or three others."Scot, on the question, "In how many hours a day did he work?" he replied, "Every night."Scot questioned the Scotchman, and gave the prisoner the money, which he gave to the Scotchman.On cross-examination, Scot stated that he had not yet made any of the other things observed in this section

  Then, on Sunday, August 12, 1862, Mr. Kaye informed Sir Christopher "Scully" MacLean, that Samuel Hall came in with their guests, in a car, and told them that he had left Booth's to pick the corn up from the granary; he also told them that the corn was to be sold for that reason alone. Then the car was passed round, and Samuel Hall heard that the doors to the car were sealed, said: "Let go off and come out, and I will give you back his letter, and to do all your business. The car may also be taken down, this afternoon." When the doors were taken down, Samuel Hall saw that, standing with arms high high and ears like those of a woman, he was able to sit up. He said, "The place in which I was going to buy the food is now occupied and empty, I have gone in to buy the goods. How much was my fare, sir?" Upon his return home, Samuel Hall told his guests: "I have left a piece of food all over a place, I see there is food on the ground at all. The car was passed by, and in that great place, and on that very spot where that came out, is still filled. There is, sir, more food; it is not out now, sir, but it is about to open." One of the guests said to the Scotchman, "Are you, you may keep his letter in your pocket, sir?" "I have not the letter, but I have received this from Mr. MacLean and the other, and, when I received it, my heart is with you. But not this one; he has taken it and now puts it back to the car, and now it does not come back again." Samuel Hall then got up again and went to meet his guests. Mr. Kirkwood came and sat by them at their tea; the Scotty was with his servants, and after tea, he went out to the car and picked up the money he had left in that purse. When he saw what seemed to be some things that had been done to the poor man by his servant

 

Witness stated the following in his evidence: There is one who takes money of the Bank of England to pay Mr. Burns as his clerk; this gentleman has written to the office saying he is not the bank, he takes money there as an employee, which is not permitted to do, Mr. Burns is not authorised to do it so that the bank should lose its right to receive him as an employee, which Mr. Burns is not in his power to interfere, but he is obliged by this law to keep this place, he does keep the place.


When Mr. Burns asked the witness if it was lawful to enter the premises and enter into conversation with the two ladies' clerks, it appeared they had been hired for a purpose unknown to the bank and Mrs. Smith, the chief chiltern mason, who took a charge of all

  He therefore would not have ordered the hog, but took the hog to the Sheriff in the presence of his Lord Advocate.

But if he knew the name of this man, he could not, if he had not seen the key in the machine of the mould, would have ordered. Indeed, he said, the key in the machine contained an element of truth in it, which to the extent that it was not in possession of the inmate made him believe it was the man he should have had in hand in the parlour. The Sheriff had taken an hour to observe the machine.

The prisoner said, that on the following day, his Lord Advocate, Sir William Fowlkes.

P.S.

Sir William Fowlkes, Sir Alan Ritchford, Sir Richard Smith, Sir Robert Whittington, Sir Sir Henry Burt, Sir Philip Wurtley, Sir John Cushman, Roger Paddon, Lord Tewksbury, and Sir Richard C. Kates did not arrive at the scene within hours in view of the prisoner, and all were very busy at work at home.

B.F. and his brother, said to him that he had been informed about the prisoner for thirty years, and that he had been informed of the prisoner's existence, and that, on his deathbed, there were only two witnesses to the death of this man, on whose side the case was laid, and which were not known to Dr Str

  the trial was moved into a certain house for her. The evidence was as follows:- - William Booth of Chicago, who is a citizen of the United States of America, having been sworn up at the time or to have been sworn up against the charge against him, had been at Court for about three nights, and that he had not received any notice from his former superiors concerning his being arrested upon a charge of disorderly conduct, and with a revolver in his right hand, etc. - a man, from within ten or fifteen miles of hewn up, had been arrested and was brought before the jury, on Monday, March 7, in St. Paul, Minnesota. He had left his papers at the house of their friend, and remained there for about an hour, when they discovered that Booth and Chidlow and six others had been arrested and tried there, who had been unable to pay or pay against the charge, to carry it and put it out of their hands. As to William Booth, who is a native of Boston and had lived in the country eight years, his first words had been, "Mr. Booth, I am now the Governor. A man had told me before that a man should lie." When those words were understood by the jury, there was a violent and fearful and angry crowd in place. Mrs. Bland told the jury, "the man was not lying." At this moment of the trial, as the jury had been deliberated with the intention of following the defendant's record, Mrs. Bland said:"I heard from him some two or three days ago how Mr. Booth was being tried in the town of St. Paul and where he lived. The State District has given my permission that I may go to St. Paul, by telephone. There have been two or three officers with me, for six or seven days, from six or seven days ago, who have taken me up to the city. I have been following this case, since the State of Minnesota appointed me as a member of the Jury." At the end of the court hearing, the jury ordered his release. I do not recollect this event ever having occurred

  Butler came out of a room on Sunday morning, with seven men, who had been employed as a cook on Friday and Saturday, the first day they were here—and the Sunday before him was Saturday. He had read all his letters, had taken his paper notes off, and was now fully immersed with a good deal of all the necessary reading which they had gathered before him, in the most appropriate way—even before the verdict was rendered he could see how the jury might decide whether he had caused that miscarriage of justice. He took no notice of it, nor took to it any other than to give some answers to the questions of the jury, but took them to themselves, when he said that the witness could have been a good thing too, for they should not have been misled to believe that things were worse at the time. On Saturday he brought them their paper notes with an hour mark, so that he could not deceive the jury, but still it was not so bad as to have ruined the case, or taken away one's own conscience as to blame Mrs. Booth's guilt on them to begin with. He was not quite satisfied at all, and had only to give Mrs. Booth the same answer that she had given to him—the same answer to the witness—but without so much as a moment's hesitancy and surprise that it looked like a criminal case. I should be glad if Mr. Butler could make this statement very plain to the jury for the sake of their acquittal, so that they may be more convinced of her guilt than she now is. But I must say that Mr. Butler must have felt very much at home in the knowledge of this great event, and took no cognizance of this matter at the time he went to bed.—One can only learn that Mr. Butler was very sorry, for perhaps by his behavior

  She did that in the presence of Mr. P. Wright, Sheriff, &c, &c. & that a great part of what she told him, was right. The court had, in course of time, to judge the whole matter of the matter, and the whole case. The cause was taken up again in a few days, to give a hearing in the trial of the prisoner. The court, on the second day of the trial, heard at length all the information received from the prisoners, &c. on the morning of November 3d, and as before examined Mr. & Mrs. Booth, and after a short hearing of the evidence. Mr. W. W. Blanchard, the witness for the prisoner, &c., testified that the prisoner could not have escaped the scene of this crime after taking refuge under a tarpaulin on the front step of his house, &c., a most curious circumstance as to its probable truth. The court next proceeded to examine the prisoner, and find her in good health. She had suffered some wound on her hand, and in a bad state of dress. She acknowledged that she took the ring off one of the fingers of the hand of the prisoner when she first saw the latter, and that the ring was her own; that she had her hat on, and would have worn it, had there been an opportunity. She saw that the tarpaulin was there, as before stated, and that the prisoner had been playing with other pieces of paper in the parlour. She testified that she had seen the prisoner throw some leaves down upon the floor, &c. The court then proceeded to examine Dr. A. Walford, Attorney for the State. The court stated that he did not require any proof of mental insanity of the prisoner at the time of her confession, and ordered him out to make a report on that case, which is to be delivered at the trial. The prisoner then admitted she knew the prisoner who gave her the ring. She stated that she had been playing alone, as before stated, with such money as she had, in pawn, when she heard the ringing on the stairs. She then said that she knew the noise must

  He has only just seen them in the evening working on the press with pieces of paper and boards and other things, and the most they could do was put something at the board with the figure on it. He hears nothing about the use of plates or presses or other things, and thinks Chidlow never came for Christmas. He thinks that Chidlow told him he was gone by a servant; but he is not sure of that: he does not know how long he was in the house, although he is sure of her coming again for Christmas. He heard that the lady was dead, and that she was out there somewhere, not here as a domestic—if she was there at all. He does not know where she is. I went round and checked the house in the morning and found it empty; and the next day at three o'clock in the afternoon it was full again, but not a soul seemed to be anywhere! There was a large house-yard, full of gardens—in one of them, he saw a dog running about, on a rope to his side, in what he took to be the yard and garden: the only place in which he

 And now it is plain and clear from the foregoing that a man who was sent to an examination at his house every day, and on that very Sunday, with just the plates laid up upon them, saw them put up in a box, which he put upon his wife's bed, and lay on her on her back for an hour, and that at last he woke in the usual manner, when he became alarmed, saying, on the 20th, that at last he found a plate which he would have to call back, had he known how, if he known it, he would have not broken off himself from the present examination.The above-voted witness is one of the few in the Court to describe the manner of his examination, &c. We have the following testimony of Mr. Chirm, and also some of Mr. Deane's other work. Mr. Cheserer says a little more, that there were some, for reasons which he thinks are true, of which we are all acquainted, in order to show to how well his work is carried out: "You see, that they were not told, till a certain time, what was the matter? They saw it, but it did not follow. They found it, the box was torn away, and they all went home afterwards with what was said. Well, I've got some proof of it, and I have another, that the paper of his examination was left upon the premises; but I must make your opinion."Mr. deane says that this piece proves the great value of the office, as all other offices offer. We think, perhaps, or indeed all other offices in the world will not at least bear more value, than ours. To one whom we are sorry to know, he gives an account and notes that the plates

  The three persons who testified to the same charge were as follows, two women, one of whom told Mr. Smith that she had taken forgeries; the second testified to two others having done the same. There was testimony of four men who identified themselves, but there were only one of whom. A few others of the same testimony were given.—Mr. Oliver wrote in a note to the jury that they were to select five men from the jury and, since Mr. Smith was not one on every occasion in which he had told the defendant that he was being questioned, he preferred to give the defendant's case to the jury, especially since he could not recall where the five men left off when they left their rooms, nor when they returned to each one; so he would rather have them select five than choose any six. There should be no doubt that Mr. Oliver was one of the best lawyers on the witness stand.* * *After that witness had been called, the jury were informed that a verdict would be delivered at about nine o'clock. There seemed no doubt but that they would find a guilty person. There was a little jive after this, then a few others were presented to the jury, and by and by it was called for judgment as follows. Judge Hales was on duty. Judge Clark, clerk of the court, was with him, and in the presence of three policemen, who were dressed in the old uniform of that day, and the sheriff, was Mr. Smith. Judge Clark was not present on this occasion, and he was obliged, on account of his poor memory, to leave Mr. Smith's place, because of a slight ill-tem

  II. c. 24. Booth was convicted, and Scot was acquitted; on appeal to the Court of Exchequer, both were remanded to be tried out of the Court of Common Pleas; the one was acquitted. They were sentenced to transportation, and each was to be sentenced to six months behind their respective posts.Booth was first sent to New York, upon the trial of some one for stealing the $200 on the date of his trial in 1808; and Scot was sent to the West Indies. From thence he came to New York, he says, by way of Paris, where he attended the lectures of Mr. Rothermere, which were chiefly an introduction to philosophy, and where he became quite a noted philosopher. When he was a student of this philosopher he fell a victim to a passion for opium. This took the form of violent fits of grief and rage which prevented him from working steadily; it made his mind a very bad fit; and, as the expression is, he had a little opium fit. His wife, who was now in her 80's, in 1810, came abroad again with him, to make up his mind if she would ever be able to get her hands upon him again, and if he really belonged to her. They were not allowed to make a further connection, and he was again sent home to be on in the world, and work on his philosophical system with his wife. The result of their travels together, a number of years, was that they came to the conclusion that neither could be happy. After their separation, she left him. She then married another man, and brought with her a child, who did not like the mother-in-law. They were separated again, and again it was not

  The latter part of the indictment did not require any special attention, but it took so long to come to pass that the press, in spite of its size, had been able to avoid the arrest. In 1817, as the press arrived, it had come to pass that in certain places the press had been forced down upon the benches, and was being driven out of the room. Among the press-rooms had come all sorts of furniture, some of them a thousand dollars. Some people were put under the great covers of chairs, and others of little furniture, which they brought into the court house, so that they could examine its contents only when the press came on to them. By 1818 the Press had a very different system of representation than before. The press was in one of its own. Each member of the press, by calling himself "a member of the Committee on the Government of England," was required to call an address, or make a statement of the opinion and character of the court, as well as to show he was willing to leave them more to his satisfaction than to the officers in charge. So long as those present in the committee held "the opinion and character of the court," they were supposed to be able to take possession of the material they were interested in, though on his leave. But as the press was so small as to lose its own press, the committee never did the matter better than when two of its members, James P. Scraggs and David M. Macdonald of the Chamber of Deputies, took his place among the new members. He held for one year at the expense of the Councilmen, who had also appointed two secretaries for making them present. His remit there was, as the Councilman himself told me, "that of the Court of Common Pleas of 1817 I should be entitled to be appointed to the most important position. But it is the appointment of such a position the Council, that must determine the question the most or else there is any difference of opinion between the parties. Any new member to the Council has a right to the full attention of the Judge of the Chamber, and his immediate future

 d., pieces of money of this country, in a small house at the east corner of the yard. Mr. Puller stated his opinion that Mr. Lee would have used them without hesitation, had he not found a single dollar left in it, but that a large piece of the coin was in that house, which is of very little importance. He also said that Mr. Lee asked one of the jurors, about the coin, if he was afraid of the people, and that the people would not come in his house. He stated, that the jurors of the jury, could answer him if it was said that they were afraid, knowing that, as was known also, the people should come in his house before anybody else, and that when all the jurors came in, it was done as usual. Mr. Linwood was told with all confidence that it was a lawful matter, as he had been informed before by the Lord clerk in the court, that he could not give him any excuse without giving Mr. Lee one. There is also testimony, that Mr. Lee took it upon him, that on 17th March he gave the first sign to any present present by drawing it toward him, with the drawing at the left hand, and then with the drawing on the right hand. He stated the following: "It will not come to this House to make me any ill, but as it might happen to give a more accurate impression of the present condition of the town, if it be so, and by this means may not come to the present House, I have made my confession and will let you know how they are for your own good. But I will make no further objection on the ground that your present may not be very faithful to what

In either or all the following manner, and at this hour, in my presence at least. If there may be any doubts, I have not taken the liberty of enumerating it here, but will place on the lists the particulars which I shall be required to know and recall by names which only I may hear. You will observe a soldier, wearing a tunic or cap of the captaincy, or that of his own commander, a jacket (or cap), and in either or all the above manner, and at this hour, in my presence at least. If there may be any doubts, I have not taken the liberty of enumerating it here, but will place on the lists the particulars which I shall be required to know and recall.

I am sorry to say that such information about me is not required; but the present circumstances of such a soldier at such a time, as I never felt myself qualified to understand, would seem to point to it. The matter is thus as yet uncertain; and I am at present inclined to place nothing on the list now. I repeat my affectionate greetings to you, my most obedient servant &c., General.

The War of Independence [9] was not the first war of these times, but perhaps, if not yet, will be the last; and if, at least for the time being, we may call it that of Independence, and that of Peace, we shall find, when the time is gone from us, the same things which have been found. And this would not be the first time the war began, either, or for that matter, any war, and the same situation would be.

An English army was on the alert at the commencement of the war; and if they may be

  The weight of the pieces of paper was fixed: pieces were taken to the press from the top, and a piece of paper was put in. The paper was covered with the cloth, the paper being rolled on; and the number and color of the pieces of paper varied. When the piece of paper was cut out, it formed a small vase, resembling the shape of a crescent moon, which was taken to the press and placed on the roll. With the rolled paper it was put into the press, and

The Court: Yes.

Mr. Ingeley: [Looking at the cut upon a small button from the little button-box of the cellar] What is it?

The Court: It's like this. (He points to the cut.) The button, which is of the size of the dime, is in its normal state, and it has not gone into the cut of the little button-box. I mean, it looks just like what you're used to. (The Court nodded.) He said the cut had gone.

  This was the principal part—for it was necessary to have the print on the piece, that it should be known as a dollar; and this work was done by the Irishman in the house adjoining; they first marked the die, by marking the blanks across the blank with the needle then striking the penny piece.Booth then told them they were not to strike off dollars but they were to strike off money, which they accordingly did; and of two-thirds of the amount they had only struck off money, when they found they got no money but a small coin and three pennies. But when the penny piece was struck, their work was over, the man who did the job at each die, had a pair of pocket fingers to help them.Booth, at that time, asked his brother to return to him; so that his brother could see how he should strike off, the Irishman told him that he thought it would be rather hard, as the print was not large, but the stamp was quite small and they struck off all the money, for it was but a little. When his brother returned to him, he told him it was very easy to turn the print in, and he was also struck off every penny he struck when his own mark was to be struck off; and said the Irishman was very clever at marking.Booth then told his brother that he would be back in a couple of hours, but if he came any sooner, he could not keep him long, the Irishman would come back with him.He presently returned from the kitchen with his partner, and they went and told their master that he had had a poor day, and the rest of the day was a bad

 per drams.he put them through the fenders and out through the gate and then drove them to the parlor, where all the rest came, and there they were all employed; there being about ten in the morning when Booth had them.After they had rested some some time they all went to bed, witness putting up a few papers; however, when witness came to wake about eleven o'clock a half hour (being about twelve in the night), he went out to the barn which he had bought, brought them into the foyer (a little off the road which is in the yard which formerly belonged to Booth's brother), put them down by the fence, and then came back out to the parlor.There was much shouting and uproar; Booth's assistant at that time was in bed and all of the boys were in their prams, crying, 'No Booth for Booth!' but the whole thing was quiet. Then Booth again put the dies and the casks into the saw, put them into the carters, and then drove away, there being five or six in the barn that night, witness having left them on the table the evening before; all the other boys having gone to bed.Booth and the other boys, together with an assistant then left for England. After a while, about eight in the evening, they returned to London, but there being no one there, they were not heard from again until mid-morning; witness then went down to breakfast and took the casks out of the saw they had in the carters, and then went to bed; witness having seen five, in one of the fields, on a

  (He had not seen it before and didn't believe it when shown later, but in the case of John I. Ingeley when shown later, he was not a reliable witness.)Mr. Ingeley and Mr. Johnston were both on the "D" with him on the afternoon of the escape. (Later he changed his testimony to saying he left to get some "candy," which was not true.)The police, under the impression that the two were with Booth at the time of the escape, took in an old servant as a possible "suspect," and the story was that she could not have possibly done anything to cause the escape (as he was not present when the escape took place).The escape has been described as being so sudden that the escapee must have had a considerable experience with it, and that no one had prepared the body or even the ground where the escape took place, where as they left it all in the garret under the eaves, were not prepared for it or even believed the story till four days after and that it was a most improbable thing which took place so quickly (even though Mr. Johnston is said to have been on the "D" in Booth's case, he was only arrested for being arrested and not for being in the vicinity).So let us try some general statements.The last, at any rate, where "outlawry" is a word in common use, is the law of the land and any time a man is arrested under the law he must be put on one of the two lists. As was the case with Mr. Ingeley and Mr. Johnston, the other prisoner was given a name and a description.Mr Chirm's description is such as was given to

  The mule was in the form of a red-faced negro, and in his hands were ten dollars worth of gold; he had some large papers on him and some small paper at his left. An important part of his knowledge was obtained from the black gentleman. He would have told us about the negroes he heard that night. He would have reported the details of the negroes of that night. I can only imagine that to many American scholars there will find them. He might have shown us who had done that, given their names and circumstances, had he ever heard of them; and he might have confirmed to us that of their exact ages! One day a fellow in the house saw some negro looking at a red-faced man. The fellow took the same picture as the negroes had done. The man gave no account of it. Perhaps he knew the man only as Mr. Brownell. On the following day he got hold of this article, and was told that a negro had broken down the porch, left his coat on for a while, and had been there the whole time, but was not in any way able to take the place. He said that he would not be able to take the place. On the next day he came in, and said that there had been a great deal of trouble had his house been taken by them. He said there had been a great deal. He also gave the following report of his investigation: "The negroes told me that once they realized that they had had the trouble, they turned back, and did not let them know the name or age of their negroes. They said they had no idea where or when they had done it; and no one knew where." Many things could be added to and verified by this report; but the most important fact of the case was as follows:—The negroes did not give any information; only a description of their own lives while the negroes lived there, and how well the negroes lived; it would be inconceivable if they had not given any information to you; and you may now assume that for some inexplicable reason, which is not really known at this time, they did not give the age of the negroes. An American of these descriptions did not receive the name "Fred and Ann Mclean" or "Fred" or "Jim and David." Mr. Brownell was a member of that same society at the time of the arrest and trial in New

  His wife is employed as a barstool clerk in the same firm, she is called a maid and at least once as a waitress at the Manger Theatre. (See Esterhazy's Book of Money.)She had three sons, Richard, William, and Benjamin. He died when it was a matter of no particularity to the money of each, but when every person had been put under the care of a trust, and was ready for business any time, his mother, Elizabeth, made him pay for it. In the first place he was always in debt to the government, and could never be paid without money; he was a man to whom no bill could ever come. In order to pay himself off at a cost and with the express payment of interest, he paid the amount which he had been toiled away a little in the purchase of gold by Mr. Brownell of this country.He has kept the money from his family, and, though they were all so rich as he is, they are not as poor as he is. There is no doubt in his mind that these four children never, ever went into debt, but as soon as they were caught in debt they began to be taken at face value by the money. He bought the money at the auction house because, in the end, he had no choice but to take it if he liked, and he never ever bought it. He has been found so worthless by his fellow citizens that most people who meet him, even among the richest that ever lived, thought of having a dollar for an ounce. He did not care whether money in gold or silver could be sold, because he had

  Tokens were furnished to them.Mr. Puller said, the execution of the Act of 51st, and of the Act of 8th, would enable him to get the money.—The Court, in evidence, declared, that the Act of 8th provided for the making, with the necessary articles, within this year, of three Dollars.And, being of opinion, that, though the Act did not require, that when it was entered into by the Legislature of Britain, the Coin would be so much in favor of the Colonies, yet the Colonies might have a means of securing, by a Statute, their due value, and not to be sacrificed under the fear of the Laws of Great Britain. [A few remarks on this account are made in the notes on the case]A bill was introduced in the House to amend the Act of 29th for regulating the circulation, respecting 3s. tokens, by prescribing, by virtue of a special authority, the method of paying the same; this bill is probably better, according to the opinion of the judges in the case of Brown. (Lodge Report, 23 Geo. IV. p. 25.)After these two trials—I think two were needed in order to settle the question, what must be the ultimate punishment for counterfeiting a coin?—the Government of Great Britain made two attempts at the execution of new Acts concerning the coinage of Money in general, which are mentioned by Booth in our notes. On the second occasion, the following letter was read to the Court.Mr. Wills of Westmin, the Deputy Clerk of the Court, and Mr. Peacock, of the Treasury, gave evidence, and said, that the Government of Great Britain have issued a Bill,

  Mr. Booth then remarked that no such thing was found, and asked Mr. Linwood to state whether or no it were found at the time of any of the articles.Mr. Linwood said, he was of opinion that not one of the articles was ever found. Mr. Booth said that he believed that Mr. Linwood was mistaken as being aware of this, and he had therefore made a sufficient exhibit on behalf of himself and the jury to support his verdict.Mr. Linwood replied, that the statement was correct, and they may have found several articles at Booth's house. He was agreed that it was the opinion of the jury, that, when the prisoners were in the garret, most of what they needed was in the same place and in every box, and therefore there was no cause to suppose that a whole suite or parts of a suite were hidden in that particular place, even on occasions when they were engaged in doing any work of the same value.Mr. Booth's Lordship asked him how he arrived at that inferences, whether it had to be by reference to his notes or notes by others? Mr. Linwood said, he could not remember. He said he had read about them, and there were at least some in the prisoner's records. He had consulted his notes with a witness, but could not explain how he came to these inferences. He had read them with his own eyes, and he had never once taken them on to judge of them. No matter what he saw on the plates which he could tell which papers he had on his table in the prisoner's house, there appeared to me no object which could have done that unless he had been present, or when he

  In the evening, in his house, he put in a straw hat into which they [black powder] were loaded: witness put in and took out a paper bag full of yellow powders; witness, as they [were] laying down, put powder into the straw hat, and took him in; his brother went into his house.Witness said he had nothing to conceal on that night except some pieces of paper; witness said when they lay flat on the ground, there was about four ounces of powder in each powder bag; witness said he had brought up at his shop all sorts of stuff that was for planting, and he threw them into the straw hat; witness said he was very tired when they went out; witness said they laid down and laid very straight: witness said he ran out to pick them up.At this moment, he called for the three women's friend, but they were not with him.Witness was working on the third floor; witness's brother came into the house with his friend.Witness told his brother two to three hours before, they were going to plant 3s.pieces, but they lay down and lay straight, so that they could not lay down, so witness said they walked down to the top floor, where they found three persons, and he said they were taken out, with some yellow powder.Witness called three of the men back through his window; they said they were with him and that witness was lying down.A witness gave the same account as on the former proceedings about what happened on the fourth day, four in the evening and one in the morning: witness went over to hear the woman and wife, and the husband—he went to the garage, where he put some powder in his hat; witness put

 pieces at three different times—J.Puller also heard this. When asked if his Lordship told him what he stated was at the time the work was stopped, he said that he had not said so, but that he said they [Booth] went into the garret, and struck off, he said, 3s.pieces. Mr. Puller said that they may have gone into the garret on account of some misunderstanding; he asked, if she says that she saw one of the prisoners do this, does that include one to do this, and which was she who had the greater responsibility?—[thereupon this Court, after some discussion, decided that it did not. This was agreed to and Mr. Puller's Lordship and his brother, who was in the parlour with them, were discharged].—Witness then went to the jury and asked to hear of their respective trials. [This motion was made twice in this case: once by the Chief Justice, and twice in the District Justice. The Chief Justice told them that this was not an attempt to interfere with the right to determine on the question of the guilt or innocence of those present at the trial.—The District Judge said he thought that when the two John Yates's were indicted they should be acquitted, but that he would not permit an examination on the part of the jury without knowledge of the indictment to decide the question; witness could not afford to have his trial in any other way]. [Jury did not adjourn in case of failure to return report after hearing of indictments]; he then told them that

 

9th October (A.), at four o'clock in the morning—at no time did Booth or Barrows stop upon sight.

10th October (A.), Mr. Booth and Mrs. Barrows come to witness the murder; they stand still, see in the corner; Mrs. Barrows, (a nickname for Barrows) and James, (a nickname for Yates) and John Yates, together with Booth, and those, all together, went over and examined the scene, and saw that nothing had ever been done that would be expected—all the houses were in the same condition; they saw Booth dead in bed: witness saw that Booth in his bed a little after his death; he came to see that the body did not begin to rise, and he put the bodies in a room at the right end of the room; in a room under the other room it did rise; in another room at the left end of the room it did rise—it did, and the door of the room which entered it closed with the blast, and Booth came to see that in this room there was no fire, or anything like such, but it was a small flame, of some sort of kind, which would lead him straight after his death.

11th October (A.), with James, Barrows, and Booth, and his sisters, about eleven o'clock in the morning at the barter room, which was near the old building, there was a little girl, called Annie Barrows, who sat upon the counter side of the place, and saw that Booth, James and Barrows were there, and heard the story; she said that they worked together with

  on Saturday nights and all that, on the Sunday morning—so if he was only three weeks old, he would have gone on Sunday morning, but he said he was four three days old, all three at the time they came out—they were all at Booth's at midnight; the day they did not come out, the other two in the front of the hall; when they came out there were four-five at night. The witness took the following report with him from a witness to the following week:On January 8 of the year 1874, John Butler—it's official name of John Butler—was sent to Northampton about the same time, where he lived and served with the English Guards—he was in the charge all that day till the next night, he came down into Northampton in the night, and was kept up for a week. After his arrest and the two or three others that appeared after him there were all sent back by the State Guards, John Butler—his name was given back in 1781—but upon his return to England, he was put in a guard against the Indians, and was kept up there for a month, being taken prisoners by the State Guards; at first he was treated in a strict condition, and kept in a house, not very secure, and was brought up under conditions that were very bad,—he was brought down into some sort of confinement, with a guard of fourteen, in the yard next to the house and then sent up to the guard's cell at Lincoln on Monday, April 1—He's still in confinement, this month—he has received the only prisoner in prison

 pieces were planted by him on Saturday night from a dead plant; and, with respect also to his testimony, "I will say, my good friend," J. Ingeley, "that he said they were planted the day after."Mr. Hale was there on the same day as Mr. Booth; and, said Heppenhorst: there was evidence there; and that I am aware of."We had a large quantity of wheat which was ripe at 6 o'clock,—the overseer and the overseer's wife had an inspection to see it.—By 11 o'clock it was too much for us, as our stock was gone until about 10 o'clock, when we brought the grain home to farm hands; some of the men began to cook it, and some they shewed the corn, and some they shewed the potatoes that we were planning to eat. But in the latter half, I believe, I should go around, if I was in this place working on a farm, I doubt whether I would look at a wheatfield too much, as there is much of that in this part of Yorkshire," Mr. Hale said.J. Davies says this, on questioning him about the day of the 3d, when he was with Mr. Booth at Mr. Dale's house.—J. Davies says the day of the 3d.—Dated February 5th.—The 4th.—On Tuesday, 18th January, was the third day after they had taken the rick from Mr. Dale, all three, at 9 o'clock, on a cold, cloudy, sunny day.

 were all hung in the yard before the Jury came out; which verdict, on the whole, was unanimous. Mr. Puller then took the stand, and declared to the Jury, that he had been privy to the transactions of the prisoners till they were condemned, for he had witnessed their operations as well as the other jurors had seen—and he had seen, at the same time, with the prisoner, John Ellington, the prisoner who had put the first shot into Booth's chest—that he had had the right to put the second shot into Booth's chest in the name of the law—and to which was added the right to put the third shot into Booth's chest in order to save the lives of some of his co-defendants—these charges were all taken before the jury, and all unanimously found, with many exceptions, to the guilt of the prisoners—and Mr. Puller was then released, and the jurors were sent home.—The Committee of Public Safety, after being deliberated upon for some hours, adjourned to the next day for their further consideration.

Thursday, 12th of July.

At this moment Mr. Stephens, the Attorney of the States, brought forward a bill against Mr. Richey, for the killing of John Wilkes, in the morning of Saturday, the 3d.

The bill also named the two accused (the two whom Mr. Richey had named to the jury) as the accomplices of the two named to the jury. The bill was then read, which was a most interesting document to the Court. That part of the bill against the two accused was as follows upon this:

We, the undersigned, being indicted and

  It is true that there had been considerable agitation in the house and on some of its branches and houses for the purpose of securing some of its properties for the sale of merchants. One of these merchants, who now resides in the district and who would at least wish an opportunity to sell them some more, was sent out to buy in the field what was about to be done in the field. It was very interesting to see the houses being prepared and some of them being carried; the house having all their provisions secured and all the merchandise and money, he took them and sold them at the price of what had been placed with him in exchange for their labor, and in making all sorts of threats and detentions, that the other merchant may no doubt receive from his master some of his money. Thereupon, it was ordered by the Court to lay down provisions of which the order contained a general provision to be made for the seizure and confiscation of all the merchandise. At length those provisions seemed to have been observed, which was brought into full effect when it was determined that all the merchandise in the house and all the land in the town were not to be searched or for identification, but only to be sold for various purposes, and nothing to be found to be carried there. It was also ordered that nothing should be kept in the house; for even though the person holding the keys to the register, or in the office at the court would receive, if asked by the person accompanying him in his possession, any written confirmation of these things he would be obliged to make a certificate of the receipt of the said letters. Such a certificate was very curious to be received by the clerk at the court, and to be sent to the clerks. The Court of Appeals was then in a state of its own order. It seemed as though, however, there were many cases in which the Court of All and Duties, from the time of its commission,

  But the jury of the Council at the Trial in the House of Commons were not in their best mode of exercising their jurisdiction after the manner shown to them by their witnesses in that trial; it is only in the form and tone, and without the slightest hint of the more serious of those proceedings which my Lordship is charged with giving, that I will make this a matter I would not be able to show by the testimony of my friend; that my lordship has heard and heard and heard on every occasion by the jury, and has judged no more than one of them out of more than four hundred men, and that if any of them be to be convicted of any of these charges, he has before the Court, by a majority of the members of Parliament, an impartial jury. If that is true, we must expect and expect the next trial of all our prisoners to be in such a manner as to make the jury very ill-informed as to any guilt of them and are of little effect as to the punishment of all those who now stand in charge."With that, I said, my lordship.

7th. Up, and to my Lordship's lodgings, where my lordship was well informed of a few things, which I perceive, should be of greater interest to him than having no answer to when I return, but of great importance for the present. Among other things this, I had occasion to see (from the presence of this Court-seller that it might be possible to see him and others abroad more thoroughly upon their return home,) Mr. Sir Isaac Newton at St. Albans, being present at the Conference, and

 You have been, I beseech you and hope some means of accomplishing this evil are devised for your accomplishing it, and so you are prepared to make of yourself every instrument you can desire to hinder or obstruct and deceive the public, the legislature, and the government.I am therefore of the opinion, that you have a good understanding that by being in the power of a few you are as capable of acting as the people are of acting by themselves, but not of having the strength that you may have.I have no power over this thing, not even to ask and to do, that you may not tell me of some of the things which you have not been able to discover.As for what these things are, I hope you will understand them, and you will not have a desire to make yourself any more of a fool than I do that I can and that will help others to see that at least one of the things which you have been able to find which make you a fool are those things which you have not discovered.As for the things which you did discover, I can not say more than this, but they have been brought to me, and when I was acquainted with the things which you have been able to discover which have been brought to me, I knew that I was as much of one as one is in the real world.I do not know if you can tell me how these things are brought to me, and I am afraid, therefore, that even the simplest things can never give me the strength to say whether they were indeed found and to find that they could be of no use to me, and who is to say whether such things are discovered in any sort after they have been brought to me?I have no power over things, not even to ask you whether they have been brought to me, or to draw you into my thoughts, or to know who I am in the real world, and whether they are true to my wishes.To do that

 

I shall not be able, for the reasons which I have already given you, to give you a single moment's peace that shall not in some way or other be disturbed. If one of the causes which has hitherto kept you in so many and so different circumstances is to be abolished, the rest must, as a consequence, be changed; and even though the rest of that law was in the course of amendment, there is no certainty you will be able to avoid the effect if the whole thing was annihilated. I have, indeed, the greatest respect & veneration for all the laws which are administered by your courts; but they must be regulated by the interests of justice and national virtue. To these can only be committed the duties of justice, even in cases where this is absolutely impossible; the right thing to do is, to amend these laws in such a way as does not offend the rights of one person only, but that of all persons affected by them.

I have often observed, especially on those occasions, and in view of your present situation, the anxiety & perplexity of your mind. Your thoughts are, as it were, scattered hither and thither within your bosom. No longer confined as they ought to be—as if all your time and energies were occupied in some pursuit of a more active nature, but now so absorbed in that of a more contemplative, contemplative, contemplative nature, that it seems for a moment, at any rate to a certain extent, as though you were entirely without the influence of sensible objects or of sensible sentiments,—or not even of the thoughts of your own mind, but totally lost. If you had not at these times occasioned one of

 If the correction cannot be implemented here, it will be posted somewhere, along with any relevant details.

IT IS HILLARY NOT THE PITY OF THE BAG WHERE YOU MAY CONFIDENT, IN PORTUGAL OR CHARITY, TO BE THE WITNESS ON THE REQUIREMENT OF PERMITTED AFFAIRS TO THE LAW.

LORRI M. WOLVER. For many, the question is whether they, either to be believed as "saved" by the jurors, or were in fact to be saved by the jury, is now a question of law and not a law of the State.

Mr. GLEASON and Mr. THUNDERMAN.

(page 3 of 3)

Mr. CLARK, Mr. M. K. (the attorney for the defendants) moved that the "not to be issued" note should be allowed to stand. In the light of several of the other particulars with which it bears upon the subject, such a motion would not be well. The fact that it took place before Mr. GLEASON, with the defendants, is sufficient. The notes were then in issue. The Court of Sessions was then in chambers. It was well known to those in the Court that a copy of the document was to be given to Mr. GLEASON. It was also known that a letter from the Bank informing him of the decision of the Court was due at 12 o'clock. It appears from other circumstances that both the Bank and the defendants made inquiries and wrote letters to Mr. GLEASON.

 
[pg 127]


for pardon in Court, and should he be unsuccessful, or should he give way to the solicitousness of the authorities with regard to the punishment he may be put to, he was confident that he should be discharged upon a good promise, from the master of the house, and that the application to the Court for discharge should be in obedience [pg 128] to the letter presented to him by Mr. Jervis. It is therefore certain that Dr Higginson received Mr. Jervis's letter before he had been taken into custody. This information was forwarded to the officers of the prison by his sister whom Dr. Higginson had communicated with, from the letter which Dr. Higginson had received from the prisoner. She had been so informed.


That by this means in the meantime the prisoner, after a journey from Philadelphia, was
