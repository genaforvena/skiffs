Molloy is living in her mother's room now and doesn't know how she got there. Molloy was helped by a man who gives her money and takes away pages every week. The man who takes the pages and gives money to the pages is the same one who always gives the pages back with the previous week's pages. Despite the money and the pages being taken away by the man every week, despite not working for money and not having any money left, she doesn't sleep in her room and has her room to herself. She has no idea how to work and doesn’t know how
A chambermaid has taken the place of a little chambermaid and is trying to resemble her more and more. The chambermaid was not true love and her true love was in another place. She needs a son, but she doesn't believe she has one. She has a son who is nearly as old as herself and comes to see her every Sunday and some days only when he's thirsty. She doesn't remember how to spell any more.
The narrator has a premonition of the end of a world and a future where all grows dim and sounds fade, leading to blindness. The narrator believes that the head is responsible for the dimness and that it doesn't work any more. The head suggests that the world is about to end and suggests that there will be one or two or three more instances of dimness before it stops working.The narrator tries to pay attention to the dim things and considers if it's her fault for this dimness. She finds it hard to formulate the thought of saying goodbye.
The scene takes place on a country road with no hedges or ditches. The road is hard and white and rises and falls at the whim of hills and hollows. There is a town nearby. Two men, one small and one tall, have left the town and retraced their steps. They both wear greatcoats and are unmistakably alike. The air was sharp and they couldn't have seen each other due to the wide space between them and the undulating land.
 SAMUEL BECKETT and the other person stopped, face to face, on a deserted road on an evening, and observed each other for a good fifteen paces before turning towards the sea which was far in the east, beyond the fields, and loomed high in the waning sky. They exchanged a few words before each went on his way back towards the town.SAMUEL went with uncertain steps and often stopped to look about him, as if he was trying to fix landmarks in his mind and retrace his steps.
He has seen many places including the plain, the sea, and selfsame hills, indigo in places in the evening light, serried ranges, cloven with hidden valleys, and marked by signs that can be divined from sudden shifts of colour and signs for which there are no words or thoughts. He has seen these hills from afar before, but now he knows them better. He knows the inner space, the brain, heart, and other caverns where thought and feeling dance their sabbath. He looks old and has been solitary for many years due to a rumour rising at birth and even earlier.
A man was carrying a stout stick which he used as a weapon against dogs and marauders. He carried the stick to propel himself onward or as a defence against these creatures. The man was innocent, greatly innocent, and had nothing to fear. He wore a cocked hat and I remember being struck by it. I watched him recede, overtaken by his anxiety due to his own anxiety. I was perched higher than the road’s highest point and flattened against a rock the same colour as myself, grey, which he probably saw.
A landmark is a place where a man would look for something after a long lapse of time, such as a lost thing or to look for lost things or to destroy something. However, a landmark is not necessarily a landmark, because a man's eyes would search out the rock, not the haphazard shadow of an un-stable fugitive thing. The man I saw didn't see me because he was in no humour for that evening and was not in any humour for all that doesn't stir, or stirs so slowly that a child would scorn it. I watched him recede and felt the temptation to get up
A wayfarer, A or C, is returning to the town he had just left. He was bare-headed, wore sand-12 SAMUEL BECKETT shoes and smoked a cigar. He moved with a kind of loitering indolence, with a pomeranian dog following him. The scene takes place in a wide open field, with fields, animals, wandering and settling for the night, sea, sharpening line of crests, sky and stars.
An orange pomeranian dog is following a gentleman who is carrying an orange fleece. Constipation is a sign of good health in pomeranians. The gentleman has a cigar in his hand. The dog follows the gentleman's path, stopping, turning in slow circles, giving up and starting all over again, indicating distress. It is obvious that the gentleman was carrying a cigar and not the dog.
The character MOLLOY 13 has lost his arms and is without arms. MOLLY 13 has a smoking object in his hand and has the ability to turn away from things about to disappear and watch them disappear out of sight. He has a crutches and is lame, but he has the strength to chase after a mangy cur named ^nan. ^nan is a dog who is scared and frightened of the man, feeling sorry for him and disgusted by him. The dog hears the man's cries and waits for him on the road, scared of him.
The character believes everything he's told and appreciates the stories he's been told because he's disbelieved too much in his long life. The character has a deep desire to know more about the person he's talking to and is open to learning more about him through stories. He has a strong interest in learning about his profession and is inter- ested in it. In a moment, the character will talk about the cows, about the sky, if he can.
I believe in the laws of the mind, such as water rising in proportion and blacken margins. I believe that it is better to obliterate texts than to blacken them, to fill in the holes of words rather than to fill them with blank and flat text. I was once again alone, which is unusual for me. I felt restored to myself, as if I had never left. I had a weakness to return to the man with the stick, but instead I returned to the observation post where murmurs began again.
The hat is an old-fashioned town hat, fastened to the buttonhole of a buttonhole, always the same buttonhole at all seasons, and fastened by a string or clastic. The hand that holds the hat moves in an arc, to and fro, and the lapel of the greatcoat opens and closes. The buttonhole in the hat is set aside for the hat, which is the reason why I never wore a flower in my buttonhole. Neither the hat nor the crutches are currently in the inventory of my possessions.
I believe that I was dwelling deep down, somewhere between the mud and the scum, on an eminence or top or on the slopes of a considerable eminence. I believe I was far away, near at hand, and beneath many things fixed and moving. I am confused about several different occasions and different times. I can't believe that the man with the stick did not pass by again that night because I would have heard him.
I sleep little by day and little by night. I sleep in the daytime and in the morning. I do not hear anything of the moon and in my night there is no moon. C. is a character I know from my first impressions of him. I believe that C. might have gone back to the town by another way too far away for me to hear its sounds.
I woke up in a distant night, divided between the murmurs of my little world and the sounds of the distant night. I never heard a human voice. I saw cows but not peasants. A and C I saw but never again, and I wonder if I will ever see them again. 16 SAMUEL BECKETT has a craving for a fellow and knows how to summon rags to cover his shame.
I needed to resolve to go and see my mother for urgent reasons. I found my bicycle, which I didn't know I had, in the same place I left it. My bicycle was a chainless bicycle with a free-wheel and it had a red horn instead of the bell fashionable in the olden days. I was crippled, but I was no mean cyclist at that period. I fastened my crutches to the cross-bar of the bicycle and pedaled with one foot on the projecting front axle.
The blowing of a rubber horn has given me only a mild pain in the balls. I used to ride a bicycle and every hundred yards or so I stopped to rest my legs. When I had to part from my bicycle, I took off the horn and kept it about me. I believe I have it still somewhere. I often stop and blow the horn when I see a motor-car horn through the lowered window of a stationary car. When riding a bicycle, MOLLO Y 17, I didn't properly get off the machine and remained astride it until I felt comfortable.
I live in an earthly paradise, suspended between the mountains and the sea, sheltered from certain winds and exposed to all that Auster vents, in the way of scents and langours, on an accursed country. Before leaving, I am aware of corncrakes that run in the corn, in meadows, and in the short summer nights around meadows. My journey began in the second or third week of June, when the sun is at its pitilessmost and the arctic radiance is shining on midnights. My mother has not seen anything for many a long day since she had not seen
Dan was my father’s name. Mag was my mother's name. I called her Mag when I needed to call her something. I saved a swallow and buried a ring. I knew more or less what she was talking about, even though I didn't always take part in the scenes she evoked.
I got into communication with her by knocking on her skull. She knew me by my smell and was happy to smell me. I communicated with her using four knocks, one of which meant yes, two no, three I don't know, four money, and five goodbye. I stuck a banknote under her nose or in her mouth at the same time as I administered the four knocks. She was under the influence of ammonia and her shrunken, hairy old face lit up when she smelled me. She jabbered with a rattle of dentures and didn't realize what she was saying due to her being
The distance from one to four knocks is too great for MOLLOY, and by the time she comes to the fourth knock, the first two knocks have been erased from her memory. MOLLY 19 didn't come for money, but rather to put the idea of money into her head by replac- ing the four knocks of her index knuckle by one or more thumps of her fist. She understood this method of putting money in her head.MOLLY believes that her mother tried to get her unstuck from the sewers, but she believes that fate had earmarked her for less compassionate sew
"I forgive her for having jostled me a little in the first months of my history. I also give her credit for not doing it again and for stopping in time when she did. If ever I am reduced to looking for a meaning to my life, I will stick my nose in the mess created by that uniparous whore and find it in that old mess. I didn't come for money, but I think there was a woman who came each week."
Samuel Beckett touched a grey wizened pear, but she didn't seem to pleased it. Samuel Beckett was disturbed by a terrible smell that she believes comes from the bowels of Araby, an odour associated with antiquity. SAMUEL BECKETT believes she has been poisoned by the sun, which she believes may have weakened her and poisoned her while she was sleeping. SamUel BecketT was confused about the direction of her journey and found herself under a deep ditch, which is why she mentions it.
I am a cyclist who has a disability and uses crutches and a bicycle to get around. I observe the rules requiring cyclists to dismount and cars and horse-drawn vehicles to slow down to a walk on narrow and darkened roads. I have a bicycle and a crutch and despite the difficulty, I have managed to get through the town using them. I was hailed by a police-man who asked me what I was doing there. I understood the police's question but didn't know what it was.
The conversation started with meanderings about a violation of public order and public decency. I am disabled and rely on crutches for assistance. I understood that there are not two laws, one for the healthy and another for the sick, and that there is only one law to which all must bow, rich and poor, young and old, happy and sad. I carried only bits of newspaper with me to wipe myself when I have a stool and I like to be in a position to do so if I have to. I took a piece of paper from my pocket and thrust it under his nose. The conversation
I was in a place where the sun was hot and the heat was scorching, but I didn't feel unhappy. I felt the faces turning to look after us, calm faces and joyful faces, men, women, and children. I heard distant music and decided to listen to it. I was stopped by a man who told me to stop listening to the music. The man pushed me and I felt a hard fist through the coverings of my hat. I had been touched by the man's hard fist, not by her skin but by his hard fist. I gave myself up to that golden moment, as if
I was questioned by SAMUEL BBCKETT at the police station dressed in plain-clothes, in his shirt-sleeves, sitting in an arm-chair, wearing a straw hat, and with a thin flexible object protruding from his mouth. Samuel BBCKetT listened to his subordinate’s report and interrogated me in a tone which left a lot to be desired from the point of view of civility. The intervals between his questions and my answers were long and turbulent. I am not used to being asked anything and I'm not accustomed to being questioned, which makes it difficult
I have lived in fear all my life, living in fear of blows and insults. Insults, abuse, and spits still hurt me, but I can cope with them. I have no papers, no occupation, and no domicile. I know how to get to my mother's address, which is by the shambles and cattle-markets. I had heard from her room, through the closed windows, the bellowing of cattle and the towns around her, indicating that she lived near the cattle- markets.
Molloy is a character who has a short, stiff leg and has been standing for a long time. Molloy has learned that sitting is not for her MOLLOY 23 any more due to her short stiff leg. She can only take two postures: vertical, drooping between her crutches, and horizontal, down on the ground. She has a great big Adam's apple and a big, Adam’s apple-shaped face. Her name is MollOY and she was allowed to keep her hat on, hoping to please.
Molloy's name is also Molloy and her mother’s name is Mollsoy. They were taken away to a guardroom where they were told to sit down and to remain standing, propped against the wall. The room was dark and full of people, including malefactors, policemen, lawyers, priests, and journalists, with dark, dark forms crowding in a dark place. She managed to get permission to lie down on a bench and repay a compliment to the guards who paid no attention to her. A woman dressed in black, a big fat woman, appeared before
Samuel Beckett was given a mug full of green tea with saccharine and powdered milk, a thick slab of dry bread, and a cup of something to prevent him from swooning by a social worker. The social worker was holding out a mug with a greyish concoction and a saucer containing green tea, saccharines, powdered milk and a thick, precariously lodged slab of bread. SamuEL Beckett is left with a mixture of hard, liquid, and soft elements in the mug. Samuel believes that when social workers offer free, gratis and for nothing, something to hinder
I was arrested in the late afternoon and was advised by the police to behave better by a sergeant. I was released in the middle of the day after being told I could go. I had a friend at court who helped me at court and impressed the sergeant, but I did not know it. I have no papers and no money to get them, which is why the police did not insist on my getting them. My bicycle was stolen from me, but the police probably didn't take it due to lack of money.
I once rested in a deplorable position, with my feet resting on the earth, arms resting on handlebars, and my head hanging over the handlebars. I consider this to be a disgraceful sight for the people who need encouragement and encouragement for their strength, courage, courage and joy. I used to be intelligent and quick, intelligent and intelligent, quick, and had the good-will of the over-anxious. I am now well-behaved within the limits of my physical capabilities. My ability to improve has never ceased to grow since my first steps.
I have always behaved like a pig, but the fault lies not with me but with my superiors who corrected me only on points of detail. I had negative and empirical notions about the principles of good manners and was in the dark due to a lifetime of observations. Since I have ceased to live, I remember the long confused emotion which was my life and judge it, as it is said that God will judge me.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has a past life where he thought he was merely existing and that passion had devoured him down to the rotting flesh. He has always cried out, more or less piercingly and openly, and believes it is said to be good for people to cry out. He is currently in a barracks and has a bicycle and a pebble in his pocket. The declining sun casts a shadow on the white wall of the barracks like being in China. The policeman on guard at the door told him to go away, but Beckett remained calm and asked for pity. Beckett sucked on
A man was angered by my slow- ness and others were watching through the windows. A pebble in one's mouth, round and smooth, appeases, soothes, and makes one forget their hunger and thirst. Inside me, someone was laughing. I took my sick leg and passed it over the frame. I had forgotten where I was going and was on the canal-bank when I remembered. I spoke in the present tense when speaking of the past, which is the mythological present tense. I was already settling in my raglimp stasis when she remembered it wasn't done and went on her
I was walking along a tow-path when I saw a team of grey donkeys on the far bank and heard angry cries and dull blows. Then I noticed a MOLLOY 27 approaching a barge carrying a cargo of nails and timber on its way to a car-penter. The boatman of the barge was a man with a long white beard and a pipe, who spat into the water. The horizon was burning with sulphur and phosphorus and I could smell the earth and the smell of the earth in the air. I hobbled down to a ditch and lay down beside my bicycle beside a haw
I had set out to see my mother at the beginning of an ending day. I had forgotten the reasons for this journey, but I knew the reasons and was determined to find them again. It was a simple matter of magic, a matter of knowing what saint to ask. I heard a howl from the grass indicating the howl resolving all, even if it was not mine. Meanwhile, the world around me is turning into a place of death, with the dead and the living, and all the famous flies.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is in a ditch, sinking deeper and deeper under the rains. He believes he will come back to a similar slough or a similar place where he will meet the sergeant and his merry men again. He has an impression that his mother thinks she is alive, which is his impression. Samuel is trying to create a being, a place, and a situation, but he is unsure how to do it without hurting anyone's feelings.
Molloy and I were on the canal-bank and Molloy was in the ditch. I remember a certain night where I was alone, with nothing but silence and the little lights of the little night, which were faint at first and then flaming and extinguished, feeding on filth and martyrs. I find myself in the morning, a morning, with the sun already high, with a shepherd watching me sleep and a panting dog who was less closely watched than his master. The shepherd stopped watching me to gnaw at his flesh and I wonder if he was waiting for an order from his master to
A shepherd and his dog were walking ahead of MOLLOY and were not leaving the path.MOLLOY identified them from the bleating of the sheep and the dog's anxious bleating, indicating that they had not left the path yet. MOllOY asked the shepherd and dog where they were going, asking if they were heading to the fields or to the shambles. The shepherd didn't reply to her question and went on his own without saying a word, instead speaking to his dog who listened attentively and listening to him attentively. MOLLY noticed that the shepherd was not going to the
The second day began with a shepherd whistle and a dog bustling about a herd of sheep. I heard the shepherd whistle, saw him flourishing his crook, and saw him bustling about the herd, which would have fallen into a canal if not for him. I saw the shepherd and the dog through a mist which rises in me every day and veils the world from me and me from myself. The bleating of the sheep became faint, suggesting that they were less anxious. My hearing is still very good, scarcely blunted coming up to dawn, but I sometimes cannot hear anything for hours on end due to
Samuel Beckett is in a land of breeders where quadrupeds and horses and goats are present. Samuel is trying to get to his mother as quickly as possible. Samuel has a strong desire to reach his mother without delay. Samus believes that the Aegean is thirsting for heat and light and has lost his sense of taste and humour due to this need. Samuel finds the pale gloom of rainy days better suited to his taste and sense of humour.
Molloy is depicted as a character with a certain angle. Molloy has a habit of covering himself in newspaper during winter and not shedding it until April. The Times Literary Supplement is an important part of his daily routine, providing him with a sense of toughness and impermeability. Molls has a problem with gas escaping from his fundament on the least pretext, causing him to fart frequently. One day, he counted over three hundred and fifteen farts in nine-teen hours.
The character MOLLOY 31 is on a journey to find her mother. She is unsure if the MOLLY 31 road is the right one as she has read accounts of other towns as beautiful as her native town, which is the only one she knows. She passes beyond the familiar ramparts and into a district she does not know.
X is the name of the only town in my memory that I know. X was given to me by a clue. I remember finding this name and intending to stop and ask a passer-by if it is X, which is the town I live in. I am unable to remember the beginning of the name and feel sure that it begins with a B or with a P. My sense of identity is wrapped in a namelessness that is hard to penetrate.
I know what the words know and the dead things. 32 SAMUEL BECKETT and the long sonata of the dead. I resolved to stop by the kerb and ask a passer-by for the name of my town, hoping to know if it was the right word, the one I was seeking, in my memory or another. Unfortunately, an absurd mishap prevented this resolution from being carried out.
I have never been particularly resolute, preferring to plunge headlong into the shit without knowing who is shitting against whom or which side has the better chance of success. I once had a plan to kill a dog, but it was aborted when my bicycle ran over the dog and I fell to the ground. Precautions are like resolutions, to be taken with precaution. The dog that was run over by the bicycle was not out on the road but in on the pavement, docile at its mistress’s heels. The lady who ran over
The character MOLLOY 33 was caught by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and all ages, who were preparing to tear him to pieces when a lady intervened. The lady accused him of killing Teddy, a man whom she loves like her own child. Teddy is old, blind, deaf, crippled, crippled with rheumatism, and perpetually incontinent, spending his days indoors and outdoors, indoors and out of dtfors. Teddy was taken to a veterinary sur- geon to have him put out of his misery. Teddy had fallen in defence of a country that had never benefited from his
The police constable has brought down heavily on my handle-bars and brought his big red hairy paw, causing me to notice and overhear a conversation with a lady about a man who ran over her dog. The man identified by the lady as a police sergeant, who is under the influence of unknown reasons. Eventually, the police sergeant disperses and the dog is removed from the conversation. The conversation is so tedious that I can't record it.
SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who frequently betrays his emotions and often does not fully understand what is being expressed. 34 SAMUEL has a strong emotional attachment to his mother who has killed her dog. 34 Samuel feels compelled to help his mother get rid of her dog because he feels morally obligated to do so. 34 Samuels's mother understood his actions and offered him certain points of view, including that he was morally obliged to help her carry her dog home and bury it, that she did not wish to prose-cute him for what he had done, and that she found him likeable
I often say too much or too little, which is a terrible thing for a man with a passion for truth. However, I realize that my verbal profusion often leads to penury in the long run. Therefore, whatever I said was never enough and always too much for me. I believe in a Divine analysis that leads to knowledge of yourself and of your fellow-men. For me, to say I needed no one was to say an infinitesimal part of what I should have said, could not have said and should never have said. I needed my mother, but there were no words to express my need
Sophie was poking a dog with a malacca, presumably a yellow mongrel or pedigree dog, who was fatally injured. Sophie believes that if she took the trouble to find the injured dog, she might find them again, but prefers to have her bellyful some other time. Lousse, the house where Sophie lived, is not nearby but is not far away.
Lousse lived in a house where Samuel BECKETT, a dog, was buried under a tree. The dog was buried by Lousse's wife, who was able to dig the hole without using a trowel or a spade. The wife had a sick leg and was unable to use her rigid leg to support her because it would have collapsed. She preferred to have her leg amputated at the groin due to her condition.
"I longed to see them removed from the old stand where they have been accused of false witness, for and against, in a lifelong charge against me." "They are decaying circus clowns who got in my way when I tried to walk, sit down, and ride my bicycle." "I would have seen to them myself with a knife or secateurs, but for my terror of physical pain and festered wounds which made me shake.""I have gone through a life of terror and pain due to these wounds."
Loussc and the dog were buried without any box or wrapping, just with the dog's collar and lead. Loussc dug the hole while I held the dog in my arms. I was unable to dig the hole due to a leg injury. The dog was heavy, cold, and smelly, but not worse than an old dog.
The scene takes place under a larch tree, which is the only tree I can identify with certainty. MOLLOY 37 is a spectator and contributes her presence to the burial of a dog named Teddy. The dog, a Teddy, was also buried beneath the tree. When MOLLY 37 finished her grave, she handed a spade and a hanghgan to the dog's owner, indicating that she had made up her mind to bury the dog at home and had not asked the vet to call and destroy it.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT was provided with food and drink by an expensive woman, but he didn't much care for good things to eat and enjoyed getting drunk. The woman had a parrot, very pretty, with approved colours, and she understood him better than his mistress. The parrot had belonged to an American sailor before he belonged to Lousse. Lousse tried to make the parrot into a French sailor, but the bird said he belonged 38 SAMU EL BECK BETT to a French and American sailor.
"Pretty Polly" is a character who has fallen asleep and woke up in a bed, in her skin, in a place where she believes they had carried their impertinence to the point of washing her. "Pretty Polly believes that she would write to the address of Pretty Polly and ask her to come and bury her if she had the address. Pretty Polly found the door and the window to her location locked and barred. She found her clothes and found a light switch and switched on the light switch but found no result. She also found her crutches against an easy chair and a chamber pot with a roll
I am in a room filled with pouffes and easy chairs, tables, footstools, tallboys, and occasional tables and chairs. I set a pouffe against an easy chair and laid my stiff leg on it. There is a strange feeling of congestion in the room and a chandelier that lights the room. My beard was missing and I felt for it with anguished hand. They had shaved me and had shorn me of my beard, which made me feel uneasy. I thought I was naked but was wearing a flimsy nightdress. I was told I was to MOLL
My mother is far away from me, but I was a little closer to her the previous night. If I were in the right town, she would have been absent, whereas if I was in the wrong town she would be present. I must have fallen asleep, as there was a huge moon framed in the window. The moon was moving from left to right, moving slower than the room or the room itself. The middle of the moon was divided into three segments, one of which remained constant, while the other two segments gained what the left lost.
I once took an interest in astronomy, geology, anthropology, and other disciplines connected with it, including psychiatry. I liked anthropology because of its inexhaustible faculty of negation, its relentless definition of man, and its concept of man as a "higher being" in terms of what he is not. However, my ideas were often confused and my knowledge of men was scant. Eventually, I discovered that magic had the honour of my ruins. 40 SAMUEL BECKETT describes ruins as a place devoid of any plan or bounds, devoid of mystery and devoid of magic.
The place described is described as a place where you find yourself without knowing how to leave and where you can't leave at will. The place is described by the narrator as full of mystery and familiar mysteries. The narrator describes the place as a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky, with no light and no wind, no loads, and no loads at all. The voice speaks of a world where all wilts and yields, the ground is unfit for loads and there is no light towards an end.
The character has seen a world at an end and believes that the world's end brought it forth and began the beginning of its end. MOLLOY 41 believes that she is at the end of her own suffering and withers as the living can't escape it. She hears a far whisper, a sound that has been silent for a long time, which she does not like and fears. Despite listening to the far whisper and fearing it, MOLLY 41 decides not to listen to it for the time being. The far whisper is not like other sounds that you can listen to when you choose and can sometimes silence
The moon which sailed gallant and full past my window had appeared to me the previous night and I was considering seeing it again when a great fright came suddenly upon me. The moon was young and slender, possibly young-and-slim, with a young woman on her back, possibly with a shaving. The new moon had appeared before the previous one, leading south, indicating that the moon has waited for the new moon before launching forth on unknown ways. I am considering going to my mother for help.
SAMUEL BECKETT saw A and C and then made up her mind to visit her mother, which took more time than she thought. SAMUEL believes that there was a period of 14 full days, or nearly 14 days, which she believes elapsed between seeing A and seeing her mother.
The moon seen from Lousse’s house was seen two nights before and was not on the eve of being full, suggesting that it was entering its first quarter. The two moons seen from the house were so alike in outline that the nalced eye could not distinguish them. I concluded that there were two moons, as far from the new as from the full moon, and that they were entering the first quarter of their respective phases. As sleep stole over me again, I remembered that my nights were moonless and the moon foreign, so that I had never seen it drifting past the window.
The conversation takes place in a room with a perfect cube and a high window. The room is described as a place where the sky and the earth take on false colours and there is an alien light. The chandelier is burning and the clothes in the room are burnt. The valet informs MOLLOY 43 that her clothes have been sent to the dyers to have the shine removed. MOLLY 43 has crutches and uses them to strike pieces of furniture without damaging them.
The valet came back with the news that my clothes had been sent for and I would have them soon. The valet helped to straighten the tables and chairs I had overturned and put them back into place, dusting them with a feather duster. Despite being unable to do much due to a stiff leg, the valet did his best to restore the objects he overturned.
The character is an oriental, a vague oriental who wears white trousers, a white shirt, a yellow waistcoat, a 44 SAMUEL BECKETT chamois, brass buttons and sandals with brass buttons, and a brass-strapped sandal strap. The character has a bicycle, which she refers to as her bicycle. She has a nightdress that is pink and transparent and adorned with ribands, frills, and lape, and she flicks them one by one with the tail of her nightdress. She takes cognisance of the clothes that people wear and is happy
The world around me seems to shift, as if it has an orbital velocity. The door in the big frosted window has shifted slightly, creating a panel of white wall within its frame. I am willing to concede that there are natural causes to all these changes and nature has infinite resources. I was not natural enough to appreciate the order of things and appreciate its niceties, but I was used to seeing the sun rise in the south and not knowing where I was going, what I was leaving, or what was going with me. It is difficult to go to one's mother with things in such a state,
The missing piece of lace to fasten the hat to the buttonhole of MOLLOY 45's hat was an old piece of old lace. MOLLY 45's bicycle was expected to be hidden somewhere below stairs or before the front door, but she decided not to ask for it because she did not want to submit him and herself to a fresh ordeal. In the pockets of her clothes, she discovered that certain things, including her sucking-stone, were missing. She chose not to say anything about the missing items, thinking it would have been wiser to let him fetch her from the garden an unsuckable
The missing knife was a noble knife, a vegetable knife, so-called stainless, with a safety catch, highly dangerous and potentially dangerous. The knife was taken from me at the police-station without my knowledge. I often throw away all I had about me in a burst of irritation. I resolved to declare loudly that the knife was missing, which resulted in me receiving a very fine vegetable knife that was stained but didn't take long to stain.The knife was stained with rust and had a dangerous safety catch which led to dangerous cuts on my fingers when I got caught between the handle of an Irish horn and the
SamuEL BECKETT tends to focus more on what he has lost rather than what he could have gained. Samuel Beckett admits that he does not always observe a principle and that it vanishes from time to time. He no longer understands what he is doing or why he does it, but he continues to engage in it even though he no longer knows what he's doing and doesn't understand it. Despite his lack of understanding and lack of knowledge, Samuel Beckett finds doing fills him with strong emotion and he doesn't stop to question what principle he's observing. SamuEL Beckett
The things that you don't bother with are those that you let go and let be for the same reason or wisely, knowing that they have no value or worth to you. You don't know what you're doing or why, and you have to go on not knowing what to do. I have never been able to conceive and have never tried, which doesn't surprise me. If I had tried, I would have known no peace until I got what I have, which is enough for me. As far as my dear little sweet little future is concerned, I have no qualms and I have a good time
Lousse was in the garden tending a grave and sowing grass in the evening. MOLLO Y 47 saw Lousse through a window lit by a wild tawny light from the staircase. Lousse was taking advantage of the cool evening and gave food and drink to MOLLY Y 47 who was looking for his bicycle. MO LLO Y47 found his bicycle half buried in a soft bush and tried to get on it, but the wheels wouldn't turn. Eventually, he threw the bicycle back in the bush and lay down on the ground, feeling most alive.
Lousse is suspected to have poisoned my beer with something intended to mollify me and Molloy. Lousse made propositions to me, which I listened to absent-mindedly as I had nothing else to do. Eventually, from these propositions, which she enun- ciated slowly and distinctly, repeating each clause several times, she elicited the following gist: I would live in Lousse's home and live there as though it were my own. I would have plenty to eat, drink, and smoke if I smoked. If I did not choose to be clean, to wear nice clones, to wash
Samuel BECKT is not in the town where Lousse is currently located. Lousse has a strong sense of smell, and the smell of spike-lavender, a strongly scented flower, brings to mind Lousse's grief and the right to contemplate her extraordinary body at rest and in motion.
She gathered lavender and made it into lavender-bags that she put in her cupboards to perfume her handkerchiefs, underclothing, and house-linen. She spent a lot of time with me, squatting or kneeling beside me while I was stretched out on the grass, lying on my back, on my stomach, and on one side. She never stopped talking and never stopped asking what town we were in. Eventually, she got up and went away, leaving me with regret and mild regret.
It was a night of listening and listening to MOLLOY 49. There was no moon, nor any other light, and the night was given to the faint soughing MOLLY 49 and sighing stirring at night in little pleasure gardens. There is a shy sabbath of leaves and petals and air that eddies there as it does in other places where there is less constraint and less vigilance. There were times when I forgot who I was, forgot to be, and was no longer that sealed jar to which I owed my well-preserved existence. Eventually, a wall gave way and I
I was once in a jar which knew neither seasons nor gardens. I was in a place where I could ask myself questions to keep myself from losing the thread of the dream. I willingly asked questions for the sake of looking at them and to believe I was still there. Perhaps that was the reason for my innocence in the jar. The jar was threadbare and a little threadbare, but I was glad to have it. When I picked up his marble, I didn't have to, and I was grateful to have picked it up.
The words engraved themselves for ever on my memory, possibly because V understood them at once. 50 SAMUEL BECKETT has a sensitive ear, and sounds unencumbered with precise mean- ing are registered better by him than most others. V has a defect of understanding that vibrates at a lower frequency or higher frequency than ratiocination, which he perceives as a defect due to repeated solicitations. 50SAMUEL has a hard-of-hearing ear and perceives the words he hears as pure sounds devoid of any meaning, which is one of the reasons why conversation was painful
My eye was ill-connected with the spider and I saw the world in a formal and inordinately formal manner. I reacted in my own way to nature and to the works of men without seeking enlightenment. I was not an aesthete or an artist. I misjudged the distance separating me from the other world and often mis-judged it, often misjudging the distance and reaching out for things far beyond my reach and knocking against obstacles. My attempts at taste and smell were less fortunate, as I often smelt and tasted without knowing what was good or bad and rarely twice running the same
I stayed with Lousse for a while after leaving the image of old Geulincx, who left me free on the black boat of Ulysses. Lousse is described as a person who has not the pioneering spirit and is not a pioneering spirit. I left Lousse after a few months or a year. The weather in my part of the world where the weather can be warm or cold or merely mild at any moment of the year, and where the days do not run gently up and down, was the same when I left as when I came.
I have been under the weather for a long time and have been able to distinguish between different types of weathers. 52 SAMUEL BECKETT believes that to be out of one and not out of the other is cleverer than him, indicating that he is not clever, but foolish. 52 I have stayed in several different rooms possibly one after the other in the parading universe. 52 In my head, there are several windows that open variously on the Parading universe and the house and garden are fixed by some unknown mechanism of com- pensation. 52 When I stayed still, I was
I have a brief recollection of an event where I helped neither in the house nor the garden and knew nothing of what was going on in the garden. I preferred the garden to the house, judging by the long hours I spent there. I heard dull sounds, sharp ones and sharp ones, and often the roar of air being vigorously churned, which to me seemed like the sound of burning. The men were always busy working there and the garden seemed to change little from day to day apart from the cycle of birth, life and death. My bicycle had disappeared and I drifted like a dead leaf on springs.
I am in a high wall-like garden surrounded by a high, high wall with broken glass-like fins. The garden is protected by a wicket-gate giving free access to the road, which is never locked. I can open and close the wicket gate without difficulty both by day and by night. I prefer to behave in the presence of wishes, active and contemplative, and find the latter preferred due to my temperament. I observe the garden, observing it as it shrivelled up and disapared, like the famous fatal skin.
Lousse is described as a woman who lives in a house with a garden and a house. Lousse rarely shows herself to me, possibly out of tact and fearing to alarm me. I suspect that Lousse spied on me by hiding behind bushes, curtains, or skulking in the shadows of a first-floor room with a spy-glass. She expressed a keen interest in seeing me both from the garden and from the house. She inspected me while I was sleeping and getting up. I remained faithful to my custom of sleeping in the morning, when I slept at all.
I used to sleep in a large garden but now I sleep in an extremely spacious house. I used to be given slow poison by a woman who gave me food and drink, but I don't know what the poison was. I accuse the woman of drugged my food and drinks with noxious and insipid powders and potions. However, I would have swallowed the poison with the same whole-heartedness even if I had been drugged. I had no appetite for conversation and I had hardly any.
 SAMUEL BECKETT devours with a voracity usually associated with heavy eaters and a method that follows from the idea of heavy eating. 54 SAMU ELIZABETT consumes a small amount of food but devours it with a great deal of deliberation and loathing, whereas a heavy eater would consume large amounts of food and drink heavily, such as consuming five or six mugs of beer with one swig and not drinking for a week. 54SAMUEL ELIKKETT was under the influence of Loussc, who insinuated stimulants into his various systems,
I have the ability to levitate in the air and collapse like a puppet when its strings are dropped, causing me to fall and lay long where I fell. I am used to this phenomenon and have prepared accordingly, much like an epileptic doctor, laying down or wedging myself where he can't be dislodged. However, I did not always take precautions to prevent the fall, preferring the fall to the trouble of having to lie down or stand fast. The falls I suffered with Loussc were less surprising to me than the levitation, as they were more in keeping with me. I have never bounded,
The meal delivered to me was served on a small tray with a low rim and coated with red lacquer. The meal was made of a single dish and one slab of bread and was served in a small, round, low-r rimless dish. I ate the meal with my hands and drank from a bottle. The bottles I drank from were brought to me separately, in a basket, and made no impression on me. I often strayed away from the place where the meal was served and couldn't find it again when I felt the desire to eat.
 SAMUEL BECKETT's health did not get worse during his stay at Lousse and he experienced no significant changes apart from those arising from the spread of existing plethoras and deficiencies, which he attributed to existing illnesses.SAMUEL believes that during his time in Lousse, no new symptoms of a pathological nature appeared, and there was nothing unusual or unusual during his stays there. SAMU ELIZABETT experienced a sudden loss of half his half-poesucking stone, which caused him to regret it.
Lousse is described as a woman of extraor-dimensional flatness, physically speaking, with a somewhat hairy face and deep, deep voice. Lousse's physical description of herself has left Molloy wondering if she is a man or an androgyne.
"I have rubbed up against a few men in my time, but I have not rubbed against a woman before. I did more than rub up against one woman named Ruth, who went by the peaceful name of Ruth, possibly Edith. Ruth had a hole between her legs, not the bunghole I had always imagined, but a slit, which I put, or rather she put, my so-called virile member. I toiled and moiled until I either gave up trying or was begged to stop. Ruth made me acquainted with love.""I lent myself to love with a good enough grace
I have seen dogs and I had seen dogs. I have a feeling that she put me in her rectum. I wonder if true love takes place in the rectum and if I have never known true love. She is an eminently flat woman with short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick, and has a yellow nape. She has voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and undergar- ments whose names I forget. We met in a rubbish dump, unlike any other, and yet they are all alike.
Samuel Beckett and Edith met in a dainty flat in a rubbish dump. Edith was an idealist and had no time to lose. SamuEL BECKETT liked the delicate furniture in the flat, including a couch that moved forward on its castors, causing chaos in the apartment due to the fall of the couch. Samuel Beckett enjoyed their encounter with Edith and enjoyed the tenderness and tenderness of their time together. He cut his toe-nails and rubbed Edith's rump with winter cream during their session. The session was short and of short duration. Samuel
"There are contingencies in true love. When a member searches for a rubbing-place and meets none, true love comes to pass. When one adds a little pedicure and massage to the equation, it becomes justified."The indifference with which I learnt of her death was softened by the pain of losing a source of revenue.""She died in a warm tub which was her custom before receiving me. The tub overturned and dirty water spilt on top of the lodger below, who gave the alarm.""I didn't think I knew the story so well."
The experience of finding a man when one should have found a woman was initially repressed and forgotten by those unfortunate enough to know about it. Only myself knew about the experience and spoke about it, with the exception of myself. I have a strong intuition that the experience was unique and perfect, of its kind, achieved and inimitable, and sought to preserve it in my heart, even resorting to self-abuse to preserve the memory of the experience. Despite having met Lousse and even fre- quented her, Lousse seems to have shown no interest in the experience, suggesting that it did not prove
My memory confuses the roles of my mother and Ruth. I think of them as one and the same old hag, widowed and withered, both old and wizened. Ruth used to speak of her defunct husband's inability to satisfy her cravings for sex. I left Lousse one warm airless night without saying goodbye to my mother. My mother must have seen me get up, take my crutches and go away, springing on them through the air. She knew the way I had of going to the wicket and drawingsex.
The character 60 SAMUEL BECKETT has left her dog's grave and has sown a garden with many many-coloured flowers and herbaceous plants. She left behind her bicycle, which she suspects to be a vehicle of some malignant agency and possibly the cause of her recent misfortunes. Samuel Beckett was afraid of wearing out a small voice saying "get out of here, Molloy, take your crutches and get out of the place." Samuel BeckETT had been hearing this voice for a long time and understood it.
I went with the wind and carried my crutches. I entered the first shelter and stayed there until dawn despite knowing I would be stopped by a policeman. I did not stay in the shelter due to the presence of a man who drove me out. I think the man was a nightwatchman employed to watch over some kind of public works. There was a touch of autumn in the air and I noticed a brazier in the distance. I found myself on a flight of stairs in a mean lodging-house which had no door or door and was empty before dawn.
I have been in a town for a long time and have been there all the time. The town was waking, doors were opening and shutting and the noise was deafening. I found myself in a narrow alley between two high buildings with little windows on every floor facing each other. The alley is a blind alley with two recesses opposite each other, littered with miscellaneous rubbish and with excrements including dog and MOLLO V 61 masters. I entered one of the alcoves and chose to sit instead of lie down.
I was leaning against a wall and was on the verge of slipping, using only the tips of my crutches as props. Eventually, I crossed an alleyway into another chapel and settled myself in the same hypotenusal posture. A fine rain was falling and I took off my hat to give my skull the benefit of it, which was cracked and furrowed and on fire. I also removed the hat because it was digging into my neck because of the thrust of the wall. The hat landed against my side.
I have a vegetable knife in my pocket which I used to open my wrist, but the pain caused me to give up and put it back in the pocket. I have a history of backsliding, which has always depressed me. I believe that life is made up of this kind of "backsliding". I wouldn't be surprised if death itself is a kind of back-sliding. SAMUEL BECKETT advised me to use the knife if necessary. There is a fine rain falling with no wind, which seems to exclude all idea of wind. My knees are enormous and I have just caught
I left the im-passe and set off towards the least gloomy quarter of the heaven, which is the one where a vast cloud was shrouding the sky from the zenith to the skylines and rain was falling. I decided to go towards this quarter because it was the one part of the heavens that was least gloomy. I am no longer with Lousse and now I am in the heart of pre-established harmony, which I believe makes a sweet music. I made this decision by taking a little pains, as I have done in other moments in my life when I took a lot of pains to
The scene takes place in a narrow, narrow doorway where a young old man is alone and shivering in the rain. Archways are visible from which many people, more courageous or less delicate, pass, avoiding getting wet due to the weather. The project conceived the day of the encounter with Lousse and her dog was prevented from being carried out due to a previous encounter with her. The young man approached the old man and stood beside him, hoping to emulate the example of one jvho who followed his example and made a speech. MOLLOY 63 decided to go out into the rain and away before making the speech
I am alone in a doorway, standing alone in the doorway with no one to stand beside me. I had stolen from Lousse a little silver, massive teaspoons, and other small objects which I did not understand but which seemed to have some value. One of these small objects, a tiny sawing-horse-like cross, haunts me. The cross resembles a sawed-off cross but is not perfect, consisting of two identical V's joined at their points of intersection by a bar.
SamUEL BECKBTT considers a strange object that stands with equal stability and stability on any one of its four possible bases, a sawing-horse, and has no obvious purpose or purpose. Samuel has fond memories of gazing upon the object affectionately and admiring it fondly. SamUEL believes that the object has a specific function and is always hidden from him. Samuel believes that to know nothing is nothing, not to want to know anything, and to be beyond knowledge is peace.
I left the shelter of the doorway and began levering myself forward using crutches, swinging slowly through the sullen air using a series of little flights and skimming the ground. There is a sense of rapture in the movement of cruts through the thronging sound of wind and limb and the rush of people who have to fasten one foot to the ground before they can lift up the other. Initially, my mind was occupied with my mother and the desire to know if I was near her, but it gradually became less because of the silver in my pockets and ancient cares. I believe that
I lost interest in knowing what town I was in and decided to leave the town. I had been trying to find my mother and settle the matter between them for a lifetime. I felt that time was running out and that it was per-haps too late to settle the issue. I drifted towards other cares and phantoms. I knew that if I kept on in a straight line, I would eventually leave, even if it was the right one.
I came to the ramparts as night was falling and described a good quarter of a circle through bad navi- gation. I was feeling harried and harried. In the country there is another justice, other judges, at first. The sky was clearing prior to the winding in the other shroud, revealing a pale and dying sky and the sun, already down, with livid tongues of fire darting towards the zenith. This phenomenon is characteristic of my region. I have never escaped from my region and the limits of the region are unknown to me.
I have travelled in a vast region described by Molloy as vast and vast and have never left it. However, I have left this region many times, thinking I was still within it. According to a feeling, this region has never left and has never will leave. I believe that whenever I wander within the distant 66 SAMUEL BECKETT limits, things will always be the same, day after day and vigrit after night. If regions merge into one another, it would suggest that my movements are due to a buckled wheel that carries me, causing jerks from fatigue to rest and in
The character has no arms and is depicted as a mother. The character's hands are depicted playing with the sheet, possibly in a love-play manner. The characters are a couple who play with the sheets, one on top of the other, but the play doesn't last long. The hands are brought back towards the character by her and she brings them towards her as if they were resting time. She also has feet with toes and without toes, which she sees at the foot of the bed. Her legs are stiff and sore, similar to her arms, and she can't forget them as she can her arms which
 MOLLOY 67 decided to give the gods a chance by turning around to give them a chance. MOLLY 67 was riding a bicycle low in the dark over the earth and along empty country roads. She thought there was little likelihood of her being molested and thought it would be more likely for her to molest the gods if they saw her. MOllOY 67 didn't miss her bicycle and she didn't mind going on her way the way she did. The morning is a time for hiding and for order, beauty and justice for those who wake up, hale and hearty, their tongues hanging out
The story takes place in a place where the shadows lengthen, the walls multiply, and you hug the walls, feeling like a good boy hiding from terror. The characters in the story are described as less rat-like than toad, less pestilent than a toad and less dangerous than a rat. The night is perilous but sweet to those who know it and can open to it like a flower to the sun. The purge of the night is in the hands of tech- nicians and the bulk of the population has no part in it, preferring their warm beds. The day is the time for
"There is no mercy for the monster on the move or on the watch, lurking in his lair or in his sleep. However, the monster can benefit from milder feelings, such as gentleness and gentleness, which deflect the barrel of a lethal weapon." "The hunter is weak at heart and senti- mental, overflowing with repressed treasures of gentility and passion." "Many a foul beast, and worthy of extermination, can live on in zoological gar dens, broken only by the innocent laughter and knowiife laughter of children and 68 SAMUEL BECKETT their elders, on Sundays
I have a tendency not to rush into things and prefer to slow down and wait for events to unfold. Therefore, when I forgot myself to the point of trying, I crawled into a hole and waited, half sleeping, half sighing, groaning and laughing, and half feeling my body to see if anything had changed. Then I resumed my spirals and did not know what became of me in the months and possibly the years that followed. I spent some time at the seaside without incident. Personally, I feel no worse there than anywhere else.
I have always believed that my land ended at the coast and not at the sea. I once went to the sea in an oarless skiff, paddling with an old bit of driftwood. I sometimes wonder if I ever came back from that voyage. I took advantage of being at the seaside to lay in a store of sucking-stones, pebbles, which I call stones, and distributed them equally between my four pockets to solve a problem.
I have a greatcoat and a pocket in which I can store stones. I have four pockets, each containing four stones. When I suck, I replace a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat with one from the left pocket of the trousers. When the desire to suck takes hold of me again, I draw on the "right pocket" of the greatcoat to ensure that I don't take the same stone as the previous time. I rearranged the stones in the pocket by replacing them with the stone which was in my mouth after I had finished sucking. However, this solution doesn't satisfy me fully as
The initial method of transferring the stones was to take the three remaining stones from the right jJocket of SAMUEL BECKETT's greatcoat and replace them with the four remaining in the right pocket of his trousers. However, this method was not enough for Samuel, who began looking for something else.
If I was certain of finding, in the right pocket of my greatcoat, four different stones, there was a risk of always finding the same stone within each group of four. Therefore, even if I increased the number of pockets, I would always end up with the same four stones. If I had eight pockets instead of the four I currently have, it would have been possible to suck at least eight of the sixteen stones, which would have increased my chances of enjoying my stones until their number is exhausted.
T has a pocket capacity to double the number of her pockets, but it is not possible to do so without the help of safety-pins. T's good leg, which was not stiff, began to stiffen and she needed a prop under the ham and even under the whole length of the leg to support her. T has difficulty in sitting on the ground because of her stiffening leg. T was beginning to lose all sense of measure after wrestling and wrangling to increase her pocket capacity. T decided to make it "all or nothing" in terms of her pocket size. T is sitting on MOLLOY
The story takes place in a world where stones are revolving interminable martingales, crushing Handfuls of sand, and sand runs through my fingers and falls back on the strand of earth. Eventually, I realize that I can achieve my purpose without increasing the number of pockets or stones, but only by sacrificing the principle of trim. The meaning of the word trim, which I had never met before, became apparent to me, but remained obscure to me until I understood that it could only mean the distribution of the sixteen stones in four groups of four, one group in each pocket. My refusal to consider any
I have found a solution to a problem that is sound and elegant. I believe that other solutions could have been found if I had been more insistent and resistant. I was tired and contrived to come up with the first solution that was a solution. My solution was to put six stones in the right pocket of my great-72 SAMUEL BECKETT coat, five in the left pocket of his trousers, and five in his trousers.
The game involves sucking a stone from the right pocket of a greatcoat and putting it in the left pocket of the greatcoat, which is the one that is empty (of stones). After sucking the stone, she transfers the six stones she sucked to the left side pocket of her greatcoat. Once the two pockets are empty, she replaces them with the stones in the right pockets of her trousers and leaves the left one empty.
In the MOLLOY 73 series, I sucked five stones and transferred them to the left pocket of my greatcoat. When the right pocket of the greatcoat was empty, I transferred the five remaining stones to the redistribution pocket. In the redistribution, I replaced the five stones in the right pockets of my trousers with the five in the left pockets. After the redistribution of the stones, I replace the six stones in my left pocket with the six in my trousers.
I sucked stones in the same order as the first time, which means that the first, seventh, twelfth and twelfth respec- tively of the first cycle might not be the sixth, eleventh, and sixteenth of the second. However, I prefer to make the best of the comparative peace of mind I enjoy within each cycle, even if it means having to remember the number of stones in my mouth and looking for them in my pocket.
Samuel Beckett's solution to the puzzle is imperfect but he is pleased at having found it all alone. 74 SAMUEL BECKETT considers his solution to be the only perfect solution. 75 Samuel Beckett believes that his solution would have freed him from anxiety within each cycle and for the sum of all the cycles. 74 Samuel finds the uneven distribution of the stones in the puzzle to be painful and inelegant, indicating his dissatisfaction with the unevenness of the distribution.
There was a kind of equilibrium in the early stages of each cycle, after the third suck and before the fourth suck, but it did not last long and I felt the weight of the stones dragging me around, dragging me to one side or the other. I think that the need to suck the stones was more than a principle I abandoned, it was a bodily need. However, I didn't give a fiddler's curse about being dragged to the right hand and the left, backwards and forwards by the stones. The stones tasted the same to me whether I sucked a different stone each time or always the same stone.
The character MOLLOY 75 is a black speck in a vast stretch of sand located in a wild part of the coast. She has lost or thrown away all the stones but one stone, which she kept in one pocket and now keeps in another pocket. She doesn't remember having been molested. Some people, including old women and young ones, came to gather wood and stare at her, but they all knew what she was and kept their distance. One person offered her something to eat and she looked at her in silence before she went away.
A young woman is approaching and stopping to look back at her companions, who are huddled together like sheep, watching her recede and laughing. As the young woman goes towards me, she doesn't stop and doesn't look away from me. Two women, one shyly approaching me and the other unhesitatingly, go away from each other. The young woman has a good eye and is able to follow the movements of those approaching her from the seaside. She often turns towards the land due to her good eye.
 SAMUEL BECKETT lives in a cave and feels reasonably secure from the elements and mankind. 76 Samuel believes that there are prices to be paid in caves and vour boxes, which one willingly pays willingly for a time but which one can't go on paying forever. 76SAMUEL has memories of his town being not strictly speaking on the sea, but inland due to a kind of swamp which exists between his town and the sea. 76Samuel's memories have their roots in the immediate past, with talk of draining, transforming into a vast port and docks, or turning into a city on piles
The city of Watt is situated in a swamp, a place where an incalculable number of human lives are lost each year due to flooding. The Public Works Department has begun to work in certain areas despite adversity, setbacks, epidemics, and apathy of the public works department. Watt is located in a place with no direct access to the town by sea, one has to disembark well to the north or the south and take to the roads. Watt has a history of living in the swamp and has known the dangers of the swamp, having risked her life in it and lived in a period of her life when
My progress has been slow and pain- ful because of a short, stiff leg which is getting shorter and getting stiffer every day. My other leg, which was supple previously, is also getting shorter but not getting shorter. When the two legs shorten at the same time, and at different speeds, it is a nuisance and a nuisance for me. I didn't know which foot to land on when I came down due to the increasing discomfort of the stiff leg. The new stiff leg hurt more than the old one because it was the other MOLLO Y 77 which I normally used as a pivot, or
The old and new injuries are of the same family, but they are of different families. The old one had one bad leg and one more or less good one. The new one is of a different family and I haven't had time to adjust to it yet. The previous one had a good and bad leg, which I was able to nurse and reduce to the maximum, using only the former. The difference between the two injuries is that the one that had previously been good, at least comparatively good, has changed for the worse. JThe old leg is still extremely painful, but less so than the new one
I have a short and stiffened leg, one of which is shortening and the other which is not. The one of the short legs is the worse of the two arJ and is in need of nursing. If I could have bent the short leg to make it seem as short as the other arJ, I would have been able to land on the short one before taking off again, but I couldn't do it due to the stiffness of the first arJ. I have managed to lengthen my short leg by chance on a road or by taking advantage of a not too deep ditch or breach of surface.
I was using crutches to walk due to a disability. totMy disability was caused by a constant and monotonous increase of pain caused by work and a decrease of pain dispensed by work. totI was walking along little forest paths where differences of level were too confused and erratic to help me. totDue to the state of disequilibrium, my progress suffered and I had to stop more and more often due to frequent halts due to the pain.
I am in a place of deep darkness, in towering forests and giant fronds, where I hobble and listen, listen, fall, rise, listen and hobble, wondering if I will ever see the hated light, at least unloved, stretched palely between the last boles. I consider hanging myself from a bough, with a liane, to end my story. I have struggled with the thought of suicide for a long time, but have always overcome the temptation to do so.
I have asthma, which has led to frequent thoughts of cutting my throat and turning purple. My asthma attacks occur mostly at night. I wrap my head in a coat to stifle the noise of choking during my asthma attacks. I dis- guised the choking as a fit of coughing, which is universally accepted and approved. My progress was slowed down by the defection of my good leg and I was getting weaker and weaker due to this defect.
I have been at the seaside for a long time and have been experiencing increasing weakness. My weakness has increased significantly, to the point where I can't believe it is the same hole referred to as the "arse-hole". The hole has become a symbol of those who have passed over in silence and is seen by me as a link between me and other excrement. I believe that the arse hole is the portal of our being and the celebrated 80 SAMUEL BECKETT mouth. I find the hole to be an eyesore and a distinc- tion due to its centrality and
I have a tendency to overlook fundamentals and think I have nothing to learn and often confuse them with accidentals. My legs developed normally at the seaside and I had noticed nothing abnormal in them. I had hardly left the shore and was absorbed in the metamorphosis of my legs when they suddenly began to gallop and became weak. I fix the desertion of my toes as the reason for the sudden change in their strength. My toes are in excellent fettle, apart from a few corns, bunions, ingrowing nails, and tendency toweak poirits.
The cramp is not the weak point of my health. My health is attributed to moral qualities, hygienic habits, fresh air, lack of sleep, solitude, persecution, and long silent screams. Santa Maria is my word of honour and I can't piss. Mammy, who gave me a nice dose of her unconquerable genes, was the source of my boils.
I have a prepuce, sat verbum, oozes urine, and a sense of smell. I have a fear of uremia and fear that it will finish me off. I fear that if it ever dawns, I will be less afraid of being finished than I am today. I do not feel at the beginning of my career and do not have the presumption to think I am near the end. I wait, jogging along, for the bell to say "one last effort, it's the end".
SAMUEL BECKETT expresses a sense of uncertainty about the future of her possessions. 82 SAMUSEL BERTETT believes that the best presentiments are true and can be borne out, but she believes that all false presentiments can be reduced to notions clear and distinct, distinct from all other notions. She was not given to presentiments, but to sentiments sweet and simple.
I used to know only in advance what I was doing, but when it came time for me to make a superhuman effort, I no longer knew what to do. I regained my ignorance when it was past. My progress is becoming more and more slow and painful due to numerous weak points, not solely due to my legs. I have placed too much stress on my legs during these wanderings, which is putting stress on the rest of my body. However, I was not an ordin- ary cripple and there were days when my legs were the best part of me, with the exception of the brain
MoLLY Y 83 has to stop frequently to dislodge clots and has to lie down to remove them due to the height of the forest. The forest is very high and the boughs are twining together at a prodigious height, compared to her own height. MOLLY has to walk in impenetrable darkness, some days she advances only a few paces, others she walks in up to thirty or forty paces. The darkness is sufficient for her visual needs, but there is a kind of blue gloom in the forest, which she sees as blue due to red and green leaves
Bui often finds herself at crossroads or crossroads in unexplored forests and describes a complete circle or less than a circle or more than one circle with a resemblance to it. Bui doesn't like gloom to lighten and prefers it to be dark, indicated by her dislike of shadows and shadows. She encounters a char-coal-burner character in the forest who she might have loved if she had been seventy years younger, but it's not certain if she would have loved him as he too would have been younger by as much if he had been younger, possibly much younger. She never had much love
A total stranger was born in a forest and has spent his whole life in the same forest. He is sick with solitude and has a charcoal-burner, which he uses to burn charcoal. The stranger has been living in this same forest for a long time and was born there. When he asked for directions to the nearest town, he found the necessary words 84 SAMUEL BECKETT and accents to get directions, but he didn't know how to leave the forest due to his extensive knowledge of it. He held me back by the sleeve, but I freed a crutch and dealt him a good
I started to examine him and gave him a few warm kicks in the ribs with my heels. I carefully chose a position, a few paces away from the body, with my back turned to it, and began to swing, backwards, forwards, feet pressed together, legs pressed together. I found it difficult to press my feet and legs together due to the state of my legs. I decided to swing in an ever-widening arc and launched myself forward with all my strength, which resulted in a fall. The shock from the fall knocked me down.
I have a preference for symmetry and have always preferred symmetry. Recently, one of my heels sank in something soft, but I managed to get up, picked up my crutches, and applied method to the exercise. If I had missed the ribs and landed in the kidney, I would have landed in a kidney but not hard enough to burst it. I believe that given favourable conditions, such as being a feeble and awk- MOLLOY 85 ward assailant, in one's own class and in a lonely place, one has a good chance to show what stuff you are made of. I have delayed writing
I read somewhere that when a man thinks he is going forward in a straight line, he is actually going in a circle. Therefore, I did my best to go around a circle in order to avoid the forest. I found that by doing this, I stopped being half-witted and became sly, and my head became a store-house of useful knowledge. Even if I did not go in a rigorously straight line in the forest, I at least avoided a circle and I looked forward to getting out of it. My region includes plains, mountains, sea, towns and villages connected by highways and byways.
SAMUEL BECKETT considers the forest described by SAMUEL ELIZABETT as not as bad as one might imagine it to be, and considers it not worse than other places in his region. 86 SAMU ELIZBETT is aware of the possibility of seeing light tremble through still boughs, strange light of the plain, and bronze-still bough-like light from the forest. 86 Samuel Beckett describes the forest as a place where no breath ever stirred and describes it as neither worse nor better than the other places he has been in before. 86SAMU
I felt compelled to stay in the forest due to an impression of committing a sin. I have always been inclined to submit to imperatives, even though these imperatives have led me to places where they have never led me anywhere. I knew my imperatives well and submitted to them because they had become a habit. My imperatives were related to my relations with my mother and the importance of bringing as soon as possible some light to bear on these issues.
The imperatives were explicit and detailed until they faltered and then went silent, leaving MOLLOY 87 feeling like a fool who doesn't know where he is going or why he is there. The imperatives related to the same painful and thorny question and were related to an issue. There was a new Latin command named Nimis sero that led to the faltering imperatives. The command to leave the forest without delay was not different from the ones MOLLY 87 was used to, but it had a different framing.
I have been going to my mother for most of my life with the purpose of establishing our relations on a less precarious footing. When I was with her, I often left her without doing anything, but when I was no longer with her I was planning and seeking the way to the house of my mother. However, when my mother appeared to give up and to busy herself with something else, I was actually planning and looking for a route to her house. I know that in a little while I won't be able to move and will have to stay where I happen to be in the forest unless someone comes and carries
The conversation takes place in a scenario where SAMUEL BECKETT is in possession of a consciousness and hears a voice saying, "Molloy," which is a line phrase more or less clear and simple. Beckett is compelled to attribute to others intelligible words or hear her own voice uttering to others. However, in reality, Beckett did not say what she would have said if she had been able to, but she heard a murmur in the silence and pricked up her ears. She expresses her consciousness by saying "I said, etc." or "Don’t do it
The conversation takes place in a setting where I am stuck and unable to move due to a lack of movement. I have to rely on some kind person to carry me during the march. As the march gets shorter and shorter, the halts become more frequent and prolonged. The sergeant suggests that I might have expressed my feelings better if I had gone to the trouble to express them.
The leaves of many trees had turned black and spongy and sank into my crutches, making it difficult for me to get out of the forest. The gloom from the black boughs of the trees slowed me down and made it more difficult to move. I thought about crawling due to the state of her legs, trunk, and head, but decided against it.
I was expecting the celebrated murmurs in the forest and was surprised to hear a distant gong instead. The gong was a gong, not a tom-tom, which would not have shocked me. My heart doesn't beat and I rely on hydraulics for the squelch that an old pump makes. I listened to the leaves before their fall, but they made no sound. I blew my horn through the cloth in my pocket, but its hoot was fainter every time. I had taken the horn off my bicycle, but I don't know when. I plunged into the undergrowth
SAMUEL BECKETT's mode of loco-motion involves crawling, crawling on his belly, and using hooks, which allows him to move with ease despite having chronic arthritis in his wrists. This mode of movement allows SAMUEL to rest when he wants to, allowing him to cover a distance of fifteen paces in a forest without needing to stop and rest, unlike other movements that have worn him out. Samuel has even crawled on his back, plunging his crutches blindly behind him into thickets and thickets with black boughs for the sky to view.
I lost my hat due to a fit of temper and banged it down on my skull with such violence that I couldn't get it off again. My hat had broken long ago and the lace had long since broken, which prevented me from meeting any lady friends. Nevertheless, I was able to maintain a steady course, turning every three or four jerks to alter course and hope that I was going forward in a straight line towards my mother. Eventually, the forest ended in a ditch and I saw the light, the light of the plain, exactly as I had foreseen.
I fell into a ditch and opened my eyes to find myself on a vast, rolling plain with only a few towers and steeples of a town, which I could not assume to be mine. The town was not familiar to me, but in my region all MOLLOY 91 plains look alike and when you know one, you know them all. I thought about going to my mother's door to ask if help was coming. Fortunately, I heard a voice telling me not to fret and that help would come.
Molloy is a character who has lapsed to the bottom of a ditch. Molloy had not heard a bird for a long time and had not seen any birds in the forest nor at the seaside. marble has a memory of birds, skylarks, corn-crakes, two travellers who had a club, sheep, and other scenes of his life. marble saw the sheep for the first time in a while and longed to go back into the forest. marble's son is sleeping and he has trimmed his lamp to last until morning. marble hears an eagle-owl's battle-cry
Jacques, also known as Moran, has a son named Jacques. Jacques is unaware of the importance of his work and believes he is on the threshold of real life. Jacques's father, also named Jacques, is unable to sleep and will get up and go to his desk to work on his report. Jacques believes he will be forgotten and his report will be long. Jacques and his son are aware of each other's names. Jacques has always loved doing and has a fondness for it. Jacques was asked to see about Molloy on a Sunday in summer.
During the weekdays, I would have rested if I could afford it. However, seeing something done which I could have done better myself gave me a sense of accomplishment and joy which I rarely indulged during the week. The weather was fine. I watched absently the coming and going of my bees and heard my son scampering down the gravel, caught up in some fantasy of flight and pursuit. I inhaled the scent of my lemon-verbena. From my neighbours' chimneys, smoke rose straight and blue and I could hear the sounds of mallet and ball, a rake on pebbles,
A man named SAMUEL BECKETT visited my house on a Sunday to pay his respects. He was not a neighbor and their business dealings were strictly of a business nature. Samuel Beckett visited from afar to disturb me. He came directly to where I was sitting, under my Beauty of Bath. He thought he was hidden from view due to the short path leading from the garden-gate to the front door, but was surprised when he slammed the gate and was confronted by a high mass. Samuel Beckett was dressed in his heavy, sombre Sunday best and was dressed for the weather.
My son was spying on us from behind a bush. He was about 13 or 14 years old and was big and strong for his age, but his intelligence seemed to be below average. I had a profession of peeping and prying and it was part of my profession. Gaber didn't wish his son to stay, but she did not wish him to stay. I called him to fetch some beer and he returned with two glasses and a quart bottle of beer. He uncorked the bottle and served it to us. I told him to wash himself, straighten his clothes, and to get ready to
Jacques was instructed by Gaber to read instructions from a notebook and leave his finger as a marker. Jacques went away grumb- ling with his finger in his mouth, which is considered a detestable and unhygienic habit. Gaber told Jacques that the job did not interest him and suggested that the chief should call on another agent. Jacques told Gaber that no one could do the job but him and that he wants it to be him. Jacques was made to get up in the middle of the night just as he was getting into position to make love to his wife by their employer.
Gaber and Gaber are agents who are involved in a conversation about a man named Jacques. Gaber believes that Jacques doesn't know what he says and doesn't understand what he does. Jacques has left with his son to attend a private communion offered by Father Ambrose during the course of the afternoon. Jacques went to mass without Gaber, who was at a conference and was unaware of Jacques' departure until it was too late for mass.
Samuels Beckett has a history of reprimanding her son, who is afraid of her. Samuel Beckett suggests that Samuels's son might not have attended mass because he was afraid of disturbing or being reprimanded by his mother. Samus Beckett feels that she has never been chastened and has been spoiled and neglected, which has left her with bad habits ingrained beyond remedy. Samantha Beckett hopes to spare her son from this fear by giving him a good clout from time to time and explains her reasons for doing so. She decides to seek the verger, Father Ambrose, for help in finding
The Verger Joly keeps a list of the faithful and keeps a register of them from his place beside the font. Father Ambrose was unaware of these activities and would have sent the verger flying if he suspected him of a work of supererogation. I knew only what went on at the mass and had no experience of the other offices, as I never went within a mile of them. I was waiting for my son to come back and Gaber, whom I had not yet heard leave. I had heard it said that these activities could have been the result of a super-vision, at the
 MOLLOY 97 was initially light-minded in her reaction to Gaber's report and was trying to gain a few more moments of peace in order to avoid thinking about it seriously. The chief's insistence on having me, me Moran, rather than anybody else, should have alerted her to the serious nature of the affair. Moran was distracted by thoughts of his breed's infirmities and the singularities of those around him, and he was dreaming about his own experiences. The poison from the poison I had just given was already acting on him. The world was changing, the colour and weight of the world were
Martha is in a bad mood and hasn't seen Jacques, who is not back yet. Jacques is a man who usually comes for a glass of beer. 98 SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that Martha can have the whole day off for the day and suggests he leaves her alone for the entire day. Martha is a heavy eater and has a fondness for heavy meals, particularly on Sunday midday meals. Martha decided to drink peppermints on her way to the presbytery and decided not to eat lunch.
Gaber went without his beer because he wanted it badly. Jacques, a neighbour, knew Gaber's habits and was aware of his Sunday habits. Jacques had been to church alone and did not engage in any social activities after church. Jacques came back from church with no trace of frolic. Gaber asked Jacques questions about the march of the ceremony and his answers were plausible. Jacques told Gaber to wash his hands and sit down to his lunch and went back to the kitchen where he made Irish stew. Jacques served the stew to Gaber and his concubine, who wept.
I am a punctual person who values punctuality and enjoys it. I have a methodical mind and has always sought prolonged reflection before embarking on a mission to ensure the best way of setting out. I take the train, MOLLOY 99 motor-coach, and sometimes leave on foot, or on bicycle, in the night. Recently, I felt a great confusion about whether or not to set out on my autocycle.
In the present case, I was tackling the problem of transport with no preparation other than Gaber's report and a languid cognizance of this report. I liked leaving on an autocycle and was partial to this method of transportation. I had not yet read Gaber’s report and had avoided reading it because he had dismissed the Molloy affair as banal. I decided to leave on the autocyCLE despite the deteriorating weather and the possibility of rain. My decision to leave was based on the "fatal pleasure principle" and I was unaware of the reasons against it. The decision
My son burst into the room and asked if he could go out. My son suggested to go to the Elms, a place they call their little public park, but there was no elm to be seen in it. SAMUEL BECKETT has been told by my son about botany and asked him to go over his botany knowledge. I suspected my son of deceit as he knew far more about it than I. I liked plants and saw them as evidence of innocence and simplicity, and at times as a superfetatory proof of the existence of God. I asked my son to be back
The servant showed me to the presbytery where Father Ambrose was sleeping. Father Ambrose offered me a cigar, which I accepted and put in my pocket between my fountain-pen and propel-pencil. I asked Father Ambrose if he noticed my son at the last mass and he confirmed that they had spoken to each other at the front row during the mass. Jacques feared that Father Ambrose might be ill and asked for a dear child who reassured him. Jacques explained to Father Ambrose that Jacques was an untimely visitor, a visitor who Father Ambrose could not shake off in time. Jacques offered Father Ambrose a glass of something to
MOLLOY 101 asked for a favour and asked for guidance from the Lord. MOLLY 101 suggested that a wink is as good as a nod and asked if I want communion. He mentioned that he was given to prolonged fasts by his doctor for the sake of mortification and also because his doctor advised it.
The priest, Father Ambrose, came back with a portable pyx and gave it to the chemist's wife, Mrs Clement. Mrs Clement is a highly qualified chemist who had fallen from the top of a ladder and broken her neck in her laboratory. She also broke her femur in the fall.
Samuel Beckett and I are concerned about their hens, particularly their grey hen who has not laid for a month and has been doing nothing but sitting in the dust from morning to night. Samuel Beckett believes it is a joy to laugh from time to time, which he finds peculiar to man. He believes that animals never laugh and that it takes them time to find it funny. Samuel has tried bicarbonate of soda to feed his hen, but she doesn't seem to like it and he advises not to use it.
I had an interview with Father Ambrose, who proposed to have her swallow dessertspoonfuls of a dessert-like substance several times a day for a few months. I declined his proposal because the chemist was closed and I had forgotten about it. The interview left me with a painful impression and I felt like one who has swallowed a pain-killer, feeling like a person who is first astonished and indignant after swallowing it. Father Ambrose was still the same dear man, but I was surprised by his lack of nobility and perceived a lack of honor. I returned home in the pouring rain after the interview feeling heavy
I was in a state of distress and unable to understand what was happening to me. I was in the middle of dozing off when her son entered her room without knocking and masturbating before her cheval-glass. I told him to be there at half-past four and reminded him about the proprieties of punctuality and decorum, reminding him about something more important in life than punctuality.
My son has a special way of saying "papa" which he uses when he wants to hurt me. My son and I are going on a journey this evening. I gave him instructions to put on his school suit, but he insisted on wearing the blue one. I also gave him a knapsack containing his birthday gifts, toilet things, one shirt, one pair of socks, seven pairs of drawers, and two pairs of shoes. He asked for specific instructions on which shirt to wear and which shoes to wear.
Samuel has an appointment with Mr 104 SAMUEL BECKETT Py for a tooth extraction scheduled for the following day. Sam has an ache and is seeking help from a dentist. Sam was born with very bad teeth and has been born with them all his life. Mr Py has a history of treating people with bad teeth, and believes that Sam will have bad teeth for the rest of his life due to his naturally bad teeth. Sam's father is down to his incisors and nippers.
My son was examining the inside of his mouth with a small glass and prising away his upper lip with his finger. MOLLOY 105 My son drew a glass from his pocket and was examining his mouth when it was raining heavily and he informed me that the sky was overcast and there was no rift in the sky. I advised him to draw the curtains and asked him if he was waiting for his stamps, which he had two albums, a big one for his collection properly speaking and a small one for duplicates, and I had authorised him to bring the latter. I felt superior to my son and felt
Martha and I are having dinner at home. I had not yet told her we were leaving. I made two mistakes in not informing her about our departure. The first was leaving her in the dark and the second was not enjoining my son to keep what I had told him to himself. I was struggling with self-doubt and self-loathing.
Samuel Beckett is annoyed by the Eisner sisters who make too much music. SamuEL BECKETT tries to mend the situation by saying he will be home a little later and not before nine. Samuel Beckett knew that Hannah, the old cook, would call Hannah and they would whisper together through the railings. Hannah never went out and she didn't like Hannah's dislike of going out. SAMUEL Beckett has an aberdeen named Zulu who is called "Little Zulu" by people.
I have a strange aversion to God and find him distasteful. I used to stroke his ears through the railings and utter wheedling words, which disgusted him. I don't like men and don't particularly like animals. I decided to leave the city a little before midnight, justified by the state of the moon. I had accepted a commission and had given my word.
Gaber is a messenger who is entitled to a notebook due to his role as an agent. Gaber was protected by a code incomprehensible to all but himself, which required him to submit his code to MOLLOY 107, the directorate, before being appointed as a messenger.Gaber understood nothing about the messages he carried and came to extravagant false conclusions about them. His memory is so bad that his messages have no existence in his head, only in his notebook.cymbals, Molloy affair, Unfathomable mind, Notebook, Good messengers,
Gaber was able to reflect on his messages and draw conclusions without losing any of his memories, including the text and gloss. Gaber believes that the messengers were not compelled to undergo a surgical operation to induce a degree of amnesia, and that their memory was good enough.Gaber spoke about his childhood, his family, and his childhood in extremely plausible terms.
Gaber and I are the only ones of our kind. Gaber has never seen any other messenger other than himself and is the only agent of their kind. Each agent in the group has their own particular messenger and each individual agent has a specific particu- lar agent. I expressed my desire for Gaber to give the job to someone else, to which Gaber replied that SAMUEL BECKETT wants it to be you. I suspect that Gaber's last words were uttered by the chief with the sole purpose of creating an illusion of being the only agents in the organization.
I was living a wretched existence at six pounds ten a week plus bonuses and expenses. I had made away with Gaber and the chief (one Youdi). I considered myself responsible for my existence. I was not made for the great light that devours and had only a dim lamp for light and patience to shine it on empty shadows. I went down to the kitchen to find Martha, who was sitting in her rocking-chair in the chimney-corner, rocking herself moodily. Martha's rocking chair was her only possession and she would not have parted with it for an empire. Martha installed the rocking chair in
Martha asked to keep her rocking-chair in the kitchen. MOLLOY 109 My weekly supply of lager, half-a-dozen quart bottles, was delivered every Saturday and I never touched them until the next day. Gaber and I, together, had emptied one bottle from the weekly supply and there were five bottles left in the pantry. The pantry contained five bottles, corked and sealed, and one open bottle three-quarters empty, which I took to my son's room where he was admiring his stamps, large and small, and shut them hastily.
The conversation takes place in a room where a father and son are arguing about a rare and valuable stamp collection. The father accuses his son of looking at his stamps. The son accuses his father of transferring to an album of duplicates from his collection of rare, valuable stamps. 1 leaves both his albums at home, the small one and the large one, a prophetic present from his father. 1 has a new Timor, the five reis orange, which cost him a florin and was a bargain at the time.
SAMUEL BECKETT has a duty to protect his son's albums, which he keeps in a safe until their return home. 110 SAMU ELIRA is upset with her son's lack of respect and demands that he put the albums in the safe until they return. 110Samuel has a strong emotional attachment to the albums and has a deep-seated desire to keep them away from him. 110She feels that her son has been lacking in respect, but does not want him to admit it. 110SAMUel believes that the loss of his most precious stamps would have been an act of
I have the ability to use magic words which I did not understand until my fifteenth year. If he had lost the gems of his collection, it would have been better for him to take the entire album, as an album is less readily lost than a stamp. However, I consider myself a better judge than he of what he can and can't do, and I believe that keeping his collection would be of profit to him. I desire to impress upon him a lesson about the value of the collection. I was determined to impress this lesson upon him while he was young and tender. I feared that should this undertaking
After dinner, I decided to make the most of my time alone. I removed my coat and shoes and got in between the sheets. I believe lying down is the best place for me to penetrate the outer turmoil’s veil, discern my quarry, find peace in another's distress, and pass judgement on those who are plunged in it and those who have need of me to deliver.
Samuel Beckett has experienced a sudden change in his life, causing him to feel a sense of fear, confusion, and fear. He interprets this change as a touch of neuralgia. Despite his feelings of fear and confusion, Samuel Beckett is not unpleasant and goes back to work. Samuel trusts more serious and imputable less to pleasure than he trusts to his work, which is why he transferred this experience to the atmosphere of the world.
I was conducting an unprofitable examination which may have established a connection between me and a man named Molloy. I had no colleagues and knew nothing of the circumstances in which I learnt of MollOY's existence. If I had had colleagues, I might have spoken to them, but I knew nothing about his existence prior to meeting him. I believe that I had invented him, as if he were ready-made in my head.
Molloy 1 was not mentioned to me by anyone but myself. Molloy was the subject of rare conversations with men and I avoided such subjects. I had no colleagues and felt an immense uneasiness due to the fact that I was alone in this affair. Mellose, the mother of MollOY, is not mentioned by anyone other than herself, which caused me to feel alarmed and uncomfortable. I knew nothing of Mellose's mother save for her name, which to me is less alive than her son, who is more alive than his mother.
Gaber has mentioned Molloy multiple times and has done so with equal intensity. Gaber has a preference for the ending of the story, which is different from the others. I, like Gaber, feel compelled to admit that I should have said Mollsoy and that in saying Mollose I was at fault. I knew little about Molls, but I did know about him. Molls had very little room and was limited in his time.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is described as massive, hulking, of a dark colour, and of a massive frame.SAMUEL is depicted as a prisoner who has thrown himself at a specific target and sought refuge near the centre of a large, open space. Samuel moves slowly, like a bear, and appears to be constantly on the move, occasionally stopping and glancing furiously about him. Samuel has the ability to move like a jungle creature, moving slowly and swaying to and fro, swaying his head, and uttering incomprehensible words. SAMUel has the capacity
The character is described as hirsute, craggy, and grimacing. I have no information on his physical appearance, but I assume him to be hunchback-like and haggard. I find it hard to imagine what brought him to such a pass and how he could put an end to it if left to his own resources. The character is meticulous and calm in the main, dedicated to the outer world, and has a strong preference for the lesser evil. He has allowed himself to be haunted and possessed by chimeras.natural end, natural end, good and bad
I am a solitary individual who sees her existence as a weakness, a weakness to be deplored but necessary if she wishes to remain that way. I clung to my solitary existence with less enthusiasm than MOLLOY 115, my hens, or my faith. I saw my life as a kind of inenarrable contraption, with little risk to my dreams and hopes. I have always believed that one doesn't wait to be hunted to hide, which has always been my motto. If I had to tell the story of my life, I would avoid mentioning these apparitions and least mention the unfortunate Molloy
I was working for an anonymous cause which was not for Molloy, who mattered to me, nor for myself. I was working on behalf of a cause that was in its essence anonymous and would subsist, haunting the minds of men. I did not take my work to heart, but rather, tenderly, for those old craftsmen whose race is extinct and the mould broken. There was a strong resemblance between myself and a character named "Molloy T" and elements of "Gaber" described by Gaber. There were three Molloys, one of which was a caricature of Gaber
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is interested in the existence of a fifth Molloy, a character who is said to be dogged by his shadow and capable of changing his mind easily. 116 Youdi is one of the five Molloys mentioned by Samuel Beckett. 116 Samuels BecketT was preparing to face Gaber's report and get down to the official facts when the sound of a gong, struck with violence, filled the house at 9 o'clock. 116 Samuel Becket was preparing the soup when the gong struck. 116 Martha, who was serving the soup, noticed
The soup before me had stopped steaming indicating that it had not been steamed for some time. Martha made a joke which pleased her enormously and made her laugh so much that she began to hiccup. Jacques refused to eat the soup, saying he's not hungry. Jacques was scarred in the face when he saw Martha's joke and asked her to tell MOLLOY 117 what she thinks of the soup.
"The sequel" was a term I explained to him a few days before, explaining its meaning and application to him. I had high hopes that he would understand the term, but he was a cunning little fellow. The sequel was called by me because the rain had stopped and scarves of fine red sheen were mount- ing in the sky in the west. Martha, who I had called "the sequel", appeared in front of me. "Shepherd's pie" is a dish I serve to the turkeys I raise. I have always had great success with my turkeys and consider them better for re
Martha and her son are having a conversation about a bird. Martha suggests to her son that he should eat something hot before he leaves because he has a stomach-ache. The bird referred to in the conversation is a bird from the previous day. Martha has a son who is inexperienced and young and inexperienced. The son denies that he told Martha that they were leaving. Martha's daughter has just made a pie for her inexperienced son.
My son was asked to fetch a minute-thermometer from the second right-hand drawer of my desk. I asked him to take his temperature and bring me the thermometer. I repeated a rather long and difficult sentence, which contained three or four imperatives, and added jocosely, "You know which mouth to put it in." I was not averse to jests of doubtful taste in conversation with my son in the interests of his education. I had a shepherd's pie which I made with a spoon and probed with a fork. I called Martha and said Martha's dog wouldn't touch
My desk has only six drawers and three drawers on each side of the space where I put my legs. My son came back with a minute thermometer and handed it to me because he had a temperature. He did not have time to wipe the temperature on the minute temperatureometer, which made me squint at the mercury. Sometimes in the winter, I would find my slippers warming in front of the fire and wonder if he had shat. I would never invoke the old testament for fear of exposing herself to thunderbolts, which might be fatal if he fell ill.
I gave Father Ambrose an enema with salt water and gave him a little wind. He struggled, but not for long. He lay down on the tiles and let the enema soak in. I lit Father Ambrose's cigar and we went upstairs to the bathroom. The porcelain, mirrors, and chromium in the bathroom instilled a sense of peace within me, but it wasn't a great peace. I brushed my incisors and brushed my back gums. I was annoyed by the sight of my moustache, which annoyed me.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has a strained leg and acute pain in his knee. He has no food in his stomach and is unable to eat anything. He asks his father for an iodex to help him with his leg pain. The family is leaving in an hour or so. The characters read a story about two old hands, veined, ringed, seeking each other.
I used iodine to rub iodine into my knee, which is full of little loose bones. I let the iodine soak in and listened to a conversation. My son asked for a report from his father and was told that he would get his report. He was tired and asked his father to take him to bed. I offered to bring him something nice and light in bed and let him have a little sleep. Martha watched me in silence, lolling in her rocking-chair. I prepared a bowl of hot milk, hot bread, a slice of bread and jam.
MollOY 121 asked me how long I expected to be away. She waited until I was standing up and had a laden tray at the foot of the stairs to ask me. I set the tray on a chair and went back to the kitchen to make sandwiches. The milk in the fridge was getting cold and form- ing a revolting skin. Molloy 121 made sandwiches and was about to go to bed. I advised her to get up in an hour or so to lock up and decide if it was worth going to bed under these conditions. When she went up to tell my son to come down
I was often away from home and often took leave of Martha during prolonged absences. Martha has been in my service for a long time and I had never taken leave of her in this manner before. I had a cigar in my mouth but it had fallen off and the ash from it fell off. I dissolved a sleeping-pow- der in the milk and left a tray with sandwiches for Martha. Martha asked for a report from the officer who was going out with the tray and asked him to get his report.
My son has been absent for a long time and usually comes to fetch the thermometer. I was concerned that he might have taken advantage of the opportunity to secure some of his favourite stamps, including the Togo one mark carm! 10 with the pretty boat, the Nyassa 1901 ten reis, and several others. I found 122 SAMUEL BECKETT from the tray a^c and decided to take it. I woke my son who was about to fall asleep and kissed him.
Molloy has a voluble personality and is extremely voluble when he thinks I'm not present. Despite Molloy's volubility, I was able to dampen his disposition. I desired this advantage for my son, that he should hold aloof from those who pride themselves on their eagle gaze. I had not struggled, toiled, suffered, made good, and lived like a Hottentot, and I wanted my son to do the same. I enjoyed playing my parts through to the bitter end and felt no remorse for shirking the issue.
I have a responsibility to provide for my son and feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing that if he dies, it would be none of my doing. I feel that there is something in the house tying my hands. I went down to the garden and moved about in the almost total darkness in search of a cigar. I found the cigar in my pocket the next day. I had intended to put it in an ash-tray or waste-paper basket.
My son likes sleeping with a night-light beside him. Until recently, he could not sleep unless he had his woolly bear to hug. I sometimes felt it was wrong of letting him have the night light beside him, but eventually decided to forbid it. Recently, I was feeling low in the garden and in the house. I went into the house to confront the darkness in the kitchen.
SAMUEL BECKETT discovered a faint reddish glow in the kitchen which could not have come from an oven, as the kitchen was equipped with a simple gas-stove, a gas oven, and aneal oven. SAMUEL has a habit of prowling in the night and peering through windows to see what's going on. He has terrified more than one of his neighbours by doing this and has found a night-light with a red chimney and a Virgin carved in wood in Martha's room.
The character Moran was preparing to go on an expedition without consulting a map or time-table, without planning his route or itinerary, and without considering the weather outlook. Moran had only a vague idea of the outfit he would need, the time the expedition would take, the amount of money he would require, and the nature of the work to be done and the means to be employed. Moran's mother had recom- mended to her son. Moran was wearing an old pepper-and-salt shooting-suit with knee-breeches, stockings, and stout black boots.
I decided to wear a heavy heavy pair of black boots and a heavy massive-handled winter umbrella. I chose to wear my straw boater, which was yellowed and had lost its band. I considered wearing a black cloak, but decided to take the heavy umbrella due to its serviceable qualities. I consider the cloak to be a serviceable garment, providing freedom of movement to the arms and concealing them. I have more than one winter umbrella and consider it to be an indispensable garment. I could hardly hope to pass unseen in this outfit.
He was like a thousand other boys of his age and condition. There is something about a father that discourages derision and commands respect. When a father is seen out with his young hopeful son, his face grows longer and longer and he is seen for being a widower. He is taken for a widow and has a wife long since deceased, leaving him with the prospect of being in a child-bed or worse, with a wife who has passed away. The thought of being seen with his son made me angry, as if he had desired my failure. If I could have reflected with calm and not been
SAMUEL BECKETT, also known as SAMUEL, usually leaves her house, her garden, her village, and her house with regret. Samuel is a person who whistles for no particular reason, indicating that she is happy to leave her surroundings. Samuel has a large bunch of keys to her house that she keeps in the right-hand pocket of her trousers and carries them with her wherever she goes. SamUEL has a son who is restless, plaintive, and whinny for food, whining for sleep, so she gave him morphine tablets from her night-table drawer.
A chain attached to braces prevents me from losing them. The chain is four or five times longer than necessary and lies coiled on the bunch, in my pocket. Its weight gives me a list to the right when I am tired or when I forget to counteract it by muscular effort. MOLLOY 127 is my son who is in the first stages of puberty and suffers from stomach trouble. I woke him from his sleep and helped him out of bed, but he resisted and dug his nails into the mattress. Eventually, he broke free from my hold.
I was disgusted by Martha's exhibition and had to use an umbrella to prevent anger. I had bored two holes in the brim of my boater with a gimlet and secured the ends of an elastic long enough to pass under my chin, under my jaws, but not too long for it to hold fast. Despite the exertions of the umbrella, the boater stayed on my head. I went to a shed and hacked at an old chopping-block in the yard, splitting it with an axe. Martha met me on the stairs and was visibly distressed.
My son and I walked through a shambles, through a wooded area with a narrow path and a narrow wicket-gate. It was nearly midnight and the night was fine. I went upstairs and helped my son put on his knapsack and told him not to forget his raincoat. I told him to carry it over his arm for the moment. The path was too narrow for us to walk abreast, so I put my hand behind me and my son grasped it.logs, blade, exhaustion, calm, etc.
The scene takes place in a wooded area with a single chimney-stack and a serrated ridge. The house is partly hidden by a little wood. The area is full of songbirds who knew and feared me. I used to think I loved my trees, bushes, flower-beds, and tiny lawns and cut branches and flowers for their growth and happiness. I grew no vegetables and lied about having turkeys and a few hens. My grey hen was found on the ground, on a perch with the others, in a corner, at the mercy of the rats.
I have given up going for walks with my son due to his ease in finding his way and his knowledge of shortcuts. I listened to a song in the evening and was entranced by the sound of hen-house music. hen-houses make music at night and the sound dies down long before dawn. Tomorrow I am free and hope to keep it. I locked the wicket-gate and left in the lane after locking the gate. I want my son to walk like his father, with rapid steps, breathing even and economical, looking neither to left nor right, oblivious to everything and apparently oblivious to his
My son often took a wrong turn or took a simple corner due to his father's election. He and his father took their walks separately and regularly took the route that led them from home to church and, mass over, from church to home. My son was caught up in the slow tide of the faithful and was not alone with me. I waited for him to come back and spoke the words calculated to settle this matter.
Samuel Beckett and his son have a tendency for their son to wander off and leave them alone in a strange place. Samuel Beckett suggests that they use a chain, not a soft, silent rope, but a chain which is not to be dreamt of, to prevent their son from escaping.
The role of the keeper and sick-nurse is to keep an eye on her son during an expedition. She was called away by an image of her son, who was behind her and before her. When she told her son to keep behind her, he chose to go to the left instead of the left. She cried out for him to come back to her. It was the summer holidays and his school cap was green with initials and a boar's head or a deer's head in gold braid on the front, and it lay plumb on his blond skull.
Midnight struck from the steeple of my beloved church, and I was gone from home. He carried his raincoat instead of folding it in a ball and was holding it with both hands, on his belly, instead of carrying it folded over his arm or flung across his shoulder. He had rolled the raincoat into a ball, holding it in both hands with both feet splayed, his stomach sticking out, his chest sunk, his chin sunk, and his mouth open in an attitude of a veritable half-wit. I asked him if he was capable of following me, but he did not answer. I
My son has received a scout-knife for his first first prize in history and geography, subjects which he excelled in. I gave the knife to him myself on the occasion of his first prize for these subjects, which were considered inseparable by the teachers at the school where he attended. My son was a great scholar, especially when it came to literature and the so-called exact sciences. He had a deep understanding of the human race's slow ascen- sion towards the light and a deep respect for the configuration of frontiers and the heights of mountain peaks. He was not averse to saving his
The character 132 SAMUEL BECKETT is a character in the Schoolboys’ Classics, a book about a character named Monte Cristo. 132SAMUEL has a knife in his pocket which he was about to use to cut off the throat of his father, who was also in possession of the same knife. 132Samuel's father was depicted as soft and soft-hearted, with a soft side for the deeds of vengeance, but he consoled himself with the thought that he would have to wait for his son's vengeance. 132 Samuel's father had left, accompanied by his son, in accordance
I am a servant who has been forced to conduct her duties in a tedious relation. I have no intention of relating the adventures which befell me and my son before they came to the Molloy country. However, I am willing to do so if it gives satisfaction to my employer and his colleagues. I do not have the imagination to imagine the content of the work, but I have more imagination than before. If I submit to the scriven- ing which is not of my province, it is for reasons very different from those that might be supposed. I am still obeying orders, but no longer out of
The voice that I follow is ambiguous and not always easy to understand. Nevertheless, I follow the voice no matter what it commands. When the voice stops, leaving me in doubt and darkness, I wait for it to return. Recently, I have drunk a little more than usual and may be of a different mind the next day. The memory of a work will help me endure the long anguish of vagrancy and vagambiguity.
MoLLO Y 133 is concerned about her freedom and her future. MoLLO is worried about losing her home, her garden, trees, lawns, birds, and the way of life in her country. She fears losing the comforts and security of her home which she has worked hard to build, to adorn, to perfect, and to keep. She does not want to lose her house and garden and believes she is too old to begin again. MollO has a strong desire to share her journey from her country to Molloy's, but she does not intend to relate all the viciss
I left my home in the Molloy country, which is different from my own. My penance is not to pass over things that are no longer unknown to me but fondly believed. I occasionally break this rule, but only over details of little significance. I observe this rule zealously and do not exaggerate. I know little better where I am going and what awaits me than the night I "lung to the wicket, beside my idiot of a son, in the lane, beside the lane".
 SAMUEL BECKETT has never crossed the Molloy country, a narrow region known as the Bally market-town. The region referred to as Bally is situated in the north, situated in a less bleak region, and is described as having a surface area of five or six square miles at the most, and represents a village-like surface area. Bally was described as a settlement, dignified by some with the name of Bally and by others as a village.
Bally and Ballyba are subdivisions of Bally. Ballybaba includes the domains ex-exclusive to Bally itself. I live in Turdy, the hub of Turdyba. Turdybaba is located in the country outside Bally and is known as the place where I get the most fresh air in the evening. Balybaba has a limited range and can boast a cer- tain diversity, including pastures, copses, undulating undulating and almost smiling aspects, and a strangled creek.
Ballyba is a small village located on a small, meandering land with no cultiva- tion due to the existence of a sacred grove or stretch of marsh. The land in Ballyba consists of a meadow, a few meadows and a few poor pastures where quitchweed grew in abundance and bitter blue grass was found.
Samuel BECKETT and his son walked for several days by sequestered ways to avoid being seen on the highways. SamuEL found Father Ambrose's cigar in a pocket after finding it in the ashtray, in the waste-paper basket, and in the pocket of his suit. The cigar was found by Samuels after he changed his suit and lit it, but he threw it away after taking a few puffs. SamUEL showed his son how to use his pocket-compass, which gave him pleasure and he was behaving better than he had hoped. Sam UEL gave his son
The story takes place in a field where a farmer is approaching a group of people, including a father and son. The father took the son by the arm and led him away in the direction of the farmer's field. The group was going home and had not yet left the field, suggesting they might have not left it far behind. The farmer offered to give the group a lift and welcome, but it was not yet midday and he didn't want to wait until night to leave. They made a wide detour and turned their faces to the north.
MOLLO Y 137 is working under a shelter under the boughs of a tree in the woods trying to reconstruct Gaber's instructions to complete his statement. Molloy, her son, has been found by Gaber and presumed to have been killed. MOllo Y 137 was looking for what was necessary to complete Gaber’s statement to complete the Yerk affair. She felt that Gaber must have told her what to do with Molloys once he was found. The sounds of her son during his sleep hindered her efforts to reconstruct the instructions.
I found Yerk on the third day. Estab- lishing contact was the least important part of my work and I was never required to prove I had suc- ceeded, relying solely on my word. I was asked for a report and was tasked with bringing the per- son to a certain place at a certain time for a delicate affair. The per-son was not a woman and I have never had to deal with a woman. I remember having invented a story about a woman who had been in love with him for six months and wanted to meet him in a secluded place. The woman
Sammie has not seen any of her patients after she finished her work and has not heard from any of them again. SAMMUEL Beckett was given directions by Gabcr to deal with Molloy, but the directions went out of her head and she was unable to determine how to approach him once she found him. SAMMEL has a lot of stories to tell, but she has not been able to tell this one.
I decided to find Molloy and devise a plan to deal with him. I had his address just as he had mine. I decided to send him a telegram to ask if there is a telegraph in Ballyba. Gaber has the ability to respond to my telegram and has the capability to give an explicit reply to it. I was trying to remember what I was planning to do with Mollsoy. Molloys and Gaber were on their way on foot when an incident occurred while I was attempting to fall asleep beside my son.
The sensation I experienced was similar to that of a blow similar to a horse's hoof and I reacted in a similar manner to it, waiting anxiously for the pain to recur and sweating profusely. The pain recurred a few minutes later but was not as bad as the first time, suggesting that I was getting used to it. The sensation recurred several times, each time less bad than the previous one, until it subsided and I was able to go to sleep more or less reassured. I had experienced the same pain before, in my bath- room, when giving my son his enema
My son was unable to tell me which of my knees I had rubbed with iodex the night before we left. SAMUEL BECKETT had woken me up early in the night. I suspect I have a touch of neuralgia brought on by tramping and trudging and cold damp nights and promising myself to get a packet of thermogene wool with a pretty demon on the outside. I woke up towards dawn with a mild erection and a natural need to make things more lifelike. I was initially unable to bend my leg, but through sheer determination, I managed to bend it slightly.
The pain was so severe that it was impossible for me to kneel and I had to bend both knees. I had a bad knee, but it was not red or swollen and felt like a' clitoris'. I examined the knee in the light of a torch and fiddled with the knee-cap. My son was puffing like a grampus and had no suspicion of what life could do to you. The sky was that horrible colour which heralds dawn. I sat down cautiously and with a certain curiosity, on the ground.
The experience of paralysis has given me a new understanding of human psychology. I have learned that when one is physically unable to stand or sit with comfort, one can explore the horizontal like a child in its mother's lap and find hidden delights. If one is able to stand up, or even sit up for a few seconds after paralysis, one has the advantage of a local and painless paralysis. I consider the great classical paralysis to offer analogous and perhaps even more unspeakable satisfactions.
The sky sinks in the morning and the earth lifts itself up to get a better view. My son woke up feeling ill and told me he didn't feel well. I could have woken him up but decided not to, letting him wake naturally. I asked my son about the location of the nearest village, Condom, which he named. I knew the village Condom as I had been there and knew it was a small town and I had some acquaintances among its inhabitants. Condom is located on the Baise and I advised him to buy a bicycle. I gave him five pounds in ten-shilling
I gave instructions to 142 SAMUEL BECKETT to buy a bicycle from Hole, a distance of about 15 miles away. 142 Samuel Beckett understood the instructions but did not look pleased. 142SAMUEL BUYED a bicycle second-hand from a venture which he had heard about from another person. 142 SAMnotes is a strong carrier of second hand, restful change, dialogue, and money.
He gave four pounds ten and five pounds ten notes to me. I counted the notes and gave them to him. I suspected he had stolen ten shillings and was trying to hide them. I was ill and didn't want him to know I wasn't ill. I asked him to empty his pockets and he emptied them, creating a cloud of dust.
I was away on business and did not keep the most rigorous accounts when I was throwing money away. I gave him notes worth 143 pounds ten shillings. He counted the notes and found out that I had given him only four pounds ten instead of five pounds. I told him to buy a second-hand bicycle. He replied that he did not know how much a bicycle costs.
I am not giving the main themes of the duet in full. I didn't tell him second-hand for preference. I told him about a ball of tangled string with ten shillings possibly inside it. I suggested that the ball of string could have been a second hand bicycle. I advised him to go to Hole, a place located about fifteen miles away, which he agreed to.
The bicycle intended for SAMUEL BECKETT was intended for Jacques Moran from Turdy. Jacques Moran gave instructions to Samuel to buy the bicycle in Hole, which was the nearest locality. Jacques advised SamuEL to go to Hole and ask the police-sergeant, giving his name and stating that he was sent by Jacques Moran. Jacques had fore-seen that his son might have trouble explaining how he came by so much money, given his age and being so young. Jacques gave his son specific instructions about how to approach the police and explain the situation.
The character has a brand-new bicycle and is waiting for instructions to use it. He doesn't feel well. He was waiting under a tree-trunk shelter under the shadow of a tree. The character is sick of the sight of him and expresses her dislike for him. He left the shelter and went about twenty paces away. She tried to look light-hearted and hailed him, calling him a lamp. He came back towards her, but she waved him away, crying.
My son was running away from me when I made to pick up a stone or piece of wood or a clod, anything in the way of a projectile. I hurled a live bough in his direction. He stopped and stared at me, his head on one side like a parrot. He spun around and took to his heels, fearing I would run after him. I have a terrifying running style, with my head flung back, teeth clenched, elbows bent to the full, and knees nearly hitting me in the face. I often catch faster runners who stop and wait for me due to this way of running.
It was in anticipation of those happy days that I had thought of the lamp and cried out to my son to buy a good one. I might have advised him about the bell, advising him to unscrew the cap and examine it to ensure it was a good bell and in good working order. I would help my son when the time came to fit his bicycle with the best lamps, both front and rear, and the best bells and brakes that money could buy. The day seemed long and I missed my son. I ate several times and took advantage of being alone at last, with no other witness than God, to
I was walking when a great weariness seized hold of my leg and I had to stop due to a heaviness. I took a little morphine and asked myself why I did not tell my son about my condition and why I had hidden it from him. I asked myself if I was secretly glad that this had happened to me, possibly to the point of wanting to get better. I surrendered myself to the beauty of the scene and listened attentively to the sounds, faint and clear, borne to me on the air by the trees, fields, sky, and birds. I brooded on the undertaking in which I
I saw a man who was standing a few paces off, standing motionless with his back to me, wearing a heavy coat and leaning on a massive and thicker stick that was more like a club. He was wearing a hat with an extraordinary shape and colour and had a huge shock of dirty snow-white hair. He had a coldness in his stare and a thrust in his thrust that I have never seen before. His face was pale and noble and he could have been much over fifty years old.
The man has dirty, dirty, noble, dirty and hairy hair that swelled up on his skull. His accent is that of a foreigner or one who has lost the habit of speech. MOLLOY 147 thought the man was going to leave without saying a word to her. Molly 147 offered the man a piece of bread and offered him a tin of sardines. The man asked for fish and she gave him bread for his son who would probably be hungry when he came back. He broke the bread into two pieces and put them in his coat-pockets.
The character has a son who carries a heavy stick and walks with a swift uncertain step, often changing his course and dragging the stick with him. The stick is light and heavy. The character wishes she could have been in the middle of a desert, under the midday sun, to look after her son. When her son didn't come, the character went into a shelter and laid down under her son's raincoat. She lit a wood-fire to warm herself and fell asleep near the fire. She said many things belonging to separate and unconnected trains of thought.
The fire was still warm from the fire. My leg was no better but not worse, possibly due to a habit that was becoming a habit. I had listened to the 148 SAMUEL BECKETT knee and submitted it to various tests. I went into a copse to cut myself a stick, but didn't have a knife. I searched for my son's knife, but it was not among the things he had laid on the ground and he had not picked up. I found an umbrella in the copse and used it to cut a stick. I practised walking with the umbrella, moving no faster and
I had to stop every ten steps due to a defect in the bloodstream. However, when I leaned upon an umbrella, the heaviness in my leg disappeared and I was able to walk more quickly. Once equipped, I no longer restricted myself to circling about the shelter and radiated from it in every direction. I gained a better view of the expanse from which my son might suddenly rise into view. I imagined him, bent over the handlebars or standing on the pedals, draw- ing near and I heard him panting and saw his joy at being back at last.
Molloy and his companions are trying to find their way back to their shelter. The shelter is becoming their little home and they are running out of their provisions of food. They have only two tins of sardines, a handful of biscuits, and a few apples. They are discussing what they want to do once they find him. They discuss the idea of ageing, which seems to present itself as a form of decay and change.
I saw a little globe swaying up from the depths of the water, smooth and scarcely paler than its escorting ripples, and a face with holes for the eyes and mouth and other wounds. I did not know if it was a man’s face or a woman's face, a young face or an old face. I felt a sense of disaster and a resignation of being dispossessed of self. I attended but absently to these poor figures and did not labour at them more diligently due to distress and loss of self-preservation. It is not in my nature to conduct calculations simultaneously and
The memory of missing instructions triggered a change in events. Whereas a fortnight ago, she was planning how long she could survive on the provisions she had left, calculating calories and vitamins, and planning a series of menus asymp- 150 SAMUEL BECKETT totically approaching nutritional zero. She was aware that she would soon be dead of inanition if she did not renew her provisions. On the second day of her journey, a man hailed her. She reacted violently when she heard a man's voice, but she continued to busy herself with her fire.
The dragon-tree of Teneriffe, which lived for five thousand years, was struck by lightning and died at the age of 5,000 years. The branch was thick and full of sap and did not burn when I stuck it in the fire. I held it by the thin end by the crackling of the fire, which allowed a man to come up to me without my knowledge. I was taken by surprise by the man who approached me, causing me to react with fear and anger. The man was a dim man, dim of face and dim of body, dim in light and dim in dark,
The intruder is described as MOLLOY 151, a small, thick-set man who wears a thick navy-blue suit (double-breasted), a pair of wide black shoes with high toe-caps, a dark muffler, and a narrow-brimmed dark blue felt hat with a fish-hook and an artificial fly stuck in the band.
The character has a face that resembles her own, with features like a moustache, ferrety eyes, a paraphimosis of the nose, and a thin red mouth. She has a limp and is unable to walk due to a limp. The character is a character who has a card, but she refuses to give it to an old man with a stick who asked her if she had seen him. The old man asked the character to call her son who might arrive at any moment.
SAMUEL BECKETT has not seen anyone and believes he has been alone for a long time. 152 SAMU ELIZABETT is in a place where he believes he can still see a hand, a hand that is pallid and pallid, opening and closing as if self-propelled, and seems to self-sufficiently open and close. 152 Samuel believes he is on a night patrol and has an idea about what is going on there. 152 Sammie is found stretched on the ground, his head in a pulp, with scratches on his body, and his leg bending normally.
My son was wearing suspenders that had come undone and were hanging loose. His legs were on the stiff side with some play in the hip joints. I went back to the shelter and took my son’s raincoat and laid down next to a fire listening to the owls and distant corncrakes. I listened to a nightin-gale and listened to distant birds that cry and sing at night. I watched the fire dying and watched out for the dawn. I packed and shouldered the two bags, took the raincoat, the umbrella, and threw the branches over the body.
The keys to MOLLO Y 153 were lost and scattered around the camp. The keys had broken into three pieces, the chain, keys and the ring, and I managed to recover them by laying down flat on my stomach among the keys. When a key was beyond my reach, I dragged it over to the grass and wiped each key on the grass before putting it in a pocket. Eventually, I located a number of keys at some distance from me, which I reached by rolling over and over.
I was looking for keys in a copse. I found an ear which I threw into the copse, and a hat which I thought was on my head. The elastic of the hat had expanded to the edge of the rim, but the elastic had been spared and the elastic was still in it. I decided to run my eyes over the area for the last time and found the ring, first one piece and then the other piece. I jammed the hat hard down on my skull, folded my son's raincoat over my arm and caught up the umbrella. I stopped at the crest of a rise to survey the
The land from where I was and the clouds in the sky suggest a painting by an old master. I made myself comfortable by eating a whole tin of sardines and one apple and laying down flat on my son's coat. I propped my elbows on the ground and placed 154 SAMUEL BECKETT jaws between my hands, which carried my eyes towards the horizon. I created a cushion of two hands on ground and laid my cheek upon it, resting my cheek on it for five minutes one, five minutes the other. The third day passed tranquilly, except for a dog sniffing about the
I made a ring, twisting two pieces together, mending the ring, and fastening the long chain. I also mended keys and made fast the keys. I asked myself a number of questions to kill time and tried to answer them. Some of the questions I asked related to the blue felt hat and the old man with the stick. I decided not to tell my son about the events, fearing he would denounce me and denounce me. I felt much as usual, much like I had changed and was still changing, and felt much the same.
The character has written with a firm and satisfied hand and a calmer mind, indicating a calm mind. The character expects to be far away before these lines are read, in a place where no one will look for them. She is confident that Youdi will take care of her son. She foresees sympathy and offers of help and esteem for him from all sides. The third day wore away and the character had eaten her last tin of sardines and a few biscuits, leaving her with only a few apples and few biscuits. At about seven o'clock, her son arrived, the sun was low in the
SAMUEL BECKETT was pushing a bicycle which he had dropped with a gesture indicating he was unable to bear it. SamuEL was carrying a bicycle that was once a good bicycle, described by Samuel as having a handlebar handle and a handle that could have been used for hooking something with the handle. SAMUEL has a plant that springs from the ejaculations of the hanged and shrieks when plucked, which he gave for four pounds.
The seller asked for four pounds five instead of the correct amount for the purchase of a bicycle. The seller had a receipt for the bicycle but did not know what a receipt was. The money I spent on my son's education was for his education. My son's bicycle had a puncture two miles from Hole and he had to walk the rest of the way to have it repaired. The shop was closed the first day and reopened the second day. The first day the shop spent ten shillings on the carrier.
The dirty little twister was letting air escape between the valve and the con- nection, causing the tyre to get hard. I asked my son to hold the bicycle and give me the pump to fix the tyre. My son protested, but I put a stop to that and the tyre became hard again. He took a bar of chocolate from his pocket and offered it to me, but instead of eating it, he cast it from him. I tried to sit down on the MOLLOY 157 carrier but the foot of my stiff leg tried to sink into the ground, into the grave. I added another bag to the
My son and I were riding a bicycle carrying bags, a raincoat, a carrier and string, and an umbrella. My seat was higher than his and I felt a sharp pain in my shin. I got tangled up in the back wheel of the bicycle. My son helped me up, but his stocking was torn and his leg was bleeding. I was thinking of phlebotomy at the time. I caught him a smart blow on the hamstrings with my umbrella.
SamuEL BECKETT and his son are on a bicycle ride. Samuel Becket has a sick leg, which makes it difficult for him to start off gently. SamuEL Becket's son straddles the frame of the bicycle and starts off gently, with his good leg supporting the back wheel. The bicycle starts to turn and the wheels start to turn, causing Samuel Becket to follow closely behind him. The character Samusel Beckett's son has a strong heart and his heart is beating under his hand, but his hand is far from his heart. SAMUEL B
My son often complained of his health, his stomach, his teeth, and he often looked worse and worse. I gave him some morphine and patched up his bicycle after a bicycle accident. In this way we came to Ballyba. My son and I spent a long time getting there and lost our way for weeks. My intention was to tell of obstacles they had to surmount, the fiends they encountered, the misdemeanours of the son and the disintegrations of the father. I would not have made it to the destination without the help of my son.
The character MOLLOY 159 has a character who is described as clumsy, stupid, slow, dirty, untruthful, deceitful, deceptive, prodigal, and unfilial. MOLLY 159's character has a son who takes good care of her despite being clumsy, slow and dirty, and taking a lot of responsibility for her care. They took a long time to get to Ballyba, but they managed to reach it because of a shepherd who was sitting on the ground stroking his dog and a flock of black shorn sheep.MOLLOY found a shepherd and his dog on the
The scene takes place with a shepherd, a sheep, a dog, and a flock of sheep. The shepherd has a pipe in his mouth and is holding it to the ground. The dog's eyes follow the movement of the pipe and the shepherd's hand following it. The sheep and the dog are in a circle around the shepherd, who is depicted as a butcher who is about to make a choice. The Shepherd has a servant named Ballyba who promises to serve him faithfully and is willing to serve for a place to lie and a little bit of food.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT has a dog and a sheep who seem to have lost interest in the conversation and are grazing on a grassy plain. 160 Samuel Beckett has a pipe and is smoking blue smoke from it. 160 Samuel BecketT gestures with the stem of his pipe at the ground indicating that he wants food. 160 The pipe is still smoking faintly and the smoke hangs blue in the air. 160 SAMU ELIZABETT's dog and the shepherd are turned to the north. 160 Juno's milk lay like a faint splash on the sharp dark^ sweep of the
I was alone with my son, feeling spellbound and wondering how to depart without self-loathing or sadness. I watched a flock of sheep, a man, a woman, a dog, and a flock moving away and felt a sense of immense sigh when it was revealed that it was not I who was departing but the flock. The flock moved away in perfect order, with the shepherd silent and the dog unheeded. The shepherd stood aside to let the flock pass and counted them as they passed, not missing a single one. After the flock passed, the shepherd went to his cottage and sat down at
My MOLLOY 161 technique brought my son to a proper sense of his iniquities. However, the next day I woke up alone in a shelter due to him disappearing with his knapsack and raincoat. He had left with a considerable sum of money.
My son has been under my supervision and has been in charge of everything, including the shopping and money. He always has a significant amount of money in his pocket and always has more money than he needs. 2. I desired my son to learn double-entry book-keeping and instructed him in its rudiments. 3. I had asked him to keep an eye out for a second bicycle, light and inexpensive, as I was tired of the carrier and saw the day approaching when my son would no longer have the strength to pedal for himself and me. 4. I believed I could learn to pedal with one leg and
Samuel Beckett's pocket-book contained only fifteen shillings. 162 SAMU ELIZABETH's first gratitude was for her son leaving her a small sum of money. 162 Samuel Beckett was alone with her bag, umbrella, and remaining money in Ballyba, but she was found in a place far from Bally. 162 SamuEL Becket's son had eaten her last pro- visions.
I have harbored childish hopes that spring eternal, such as that my son would have pity on me and come back to me, or that Molloy, whose country this was, would come to me who had not been able to reach out to him and become a friend and like a father to me. I let these hopes spring within me and grow in strength, brighten and charm me with a thousand fancies. I swept these hopes away with a great dis- gusted sweep of all my being. In the evening, I turned to the lights of Bally and watched them shine brighter and brighter and then all
The character MOLLO Y 163 experiences a strong fit of laughter at the thought of possible punishments inflicted by Youdi, causing her to shake and her whole body to shake. MOLLY Y 163's laughter caused her to lean against a tree or against a bujW when the fit came on her. She describes her laughter as a strange and possibly misnamed form of laughter due to indolence or ignorance, drawing towards it as the sands towards a wave similar to the image of a turd waiting for the flush.MOLLY 163's heart missed a beat when a fly, flying low above her
I was spending the day in a shelter and felt content, content, and almost elated with my performance. Gaber's arrival put an end to these activities and I had just crawled out of the shelter to have a good laugh at the lights of Bally when Gaber arrived. Moran, Gaber, was already been there for some time and was sitting on a tree-stump, half asleep. Moran was dressed as he was the last time I saw him and was dressed in his Sunday clothes. Moran is not familiar with 164 SAMUEL BECKETT's voice.
Jacques has a small electric torch and a notebook which he uses to communicate his thoughts and feelings. Moran is a character who suffers from a sickness and is unable to walk. Moran's son has abandoned him. Moran has not shaved since the day his son brought back the bicycle from Hole, he has not combed his hair, nor washed, and has suffered privations, privations and great inward metamorphoses. Jacques is dying of thirst. Moran does not recognize Jacques.
Gaber is concerned about a man named Moran who keeps rubbing his hands from morning to night. Gaber believes that Moran is angry with him. Moran has been telling Gaber what he told him the other day. Moran is getting old and is getting worse, according to Gaber. Despite her loathing for MOLLO Y 165, Gaber holds Moran back by the sleeve despite her weakness and a sick leg.
Gaber has a walrus moustache, chestnut in colour, and a deep voice. Gaber was pushed to the ground by a man who did not intend to make him fall and only wanted to push him away. According to Gaber, the man had a solicitude towards Gaber and wanted to help him up. The man who pushed Gaber away was revealed to be a clod. The clod told Gaber that life is a thing of beauty and a joy for ever.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who has a faithful umbrella. Smiles are nice in their own way, but they are at a reasonable distance.SAMUEL has torn up a lot of grass and earth and was about to start uprooting it when he woke up. Samuel desisted from uprooting and set out for home that night. Each day saw Samuel advance a little further and count by tens of steps each time he reached a certain distance.
I used to think that men would never get the better of me. I used to believe I am cleverer than things. I ate in accordance with the voice of reason, nature, the woods, the fields, the waters, and nature itself. I finished the morphine in August or September of the previous year and was ordered home in the spring of the following year. When a thing resists me, even if it is for my own good, it doesn't resist me long. For example, the snow initially resisted me more than it resisted me, but eventually I vanquished it and forged my way through the snow towards
On the way home, I experienced a knee injury that was neither more nor less painful than the previous one. I was thinking about flies that hatch out at the beginning of winter, die shortly after, and are described as puny, sluggish, torpid, mute, and possibly very young. I like to think of these flies as those that hatch from warm, warm corners and die very young, possibly without being able to lay. However, I was distracted by other affections at the time and would not have described these flies.
If I had decided not to keep the hangman waiting, I would have made it home on all fours and performed a ritual of cleansing and chanting maledictions. However, due to fear and fear of fiends in human shape and phantoms of the dead, I will not dwell on the journey home due to theological questions of a theological nature. I will only utter one or two words for edification and to prepare my soul to make an end.
The questions are about devils and devils not feeling the pains of hell and the excommunication of vermin in the sixteenth century. 8 Saint-Roch refused to suck on Wed- nesdays and Fridays. 9 Lovat, an Italian cobbler, had 168 SAMUHL BECKETT cut off his testicles and crucified himself. 10 Judas' torments are suspended on Saturdays.
The questions are: 8. Youdi, Gaber, Molloy, his mother, Yerk, Murphy, Watt, Camier, Zulu, the Eisner sisters, Acacia Square, and the name of the martyr who, while in prison, celebrated the consecration of consecration on his stomach and gave himself absolution. 13. If I wrote to Youdi and went to see him, I would crave his forgiveness. 14. The winter has been exceptionally severe and I have gone without either confession or communion.
The dance of the bees involves a system of signals by which the incoming bees communicate with the outgoing ones. I alone of all mankind knows this phenomenon. The dance is best observed among the bees re-turning to the hive laden with nectar. The outgoing bees dance and communicate with each other during the dance. However, when the bees are away from the hive and busy at work, they do not dance. I first deduced that each figure in the dance is reinforced by a hum peculiar to it, but I was forced to abandon this hypothesis when I saw the same figure repeated by different hums.
The purpose of the hum is not to enhance the dance, but to vary the dance according to the figure and the hum. 170 SAMUEL BECKETT has collected and classified a great number of observations on this subject and has developed a conviction that the selfsame figure, accompanied by the self-same hum, does not mean the same thing at twelve feet from the ground as it does at six feet. 170SAMUEL believes that the bees do not dance at any level but at three or four levels, always the same level at which the figure was executed. 170Samuel has measured the levels and
During the long journey home, the thought of my bees and their dance was the closest thing to comfort for me. I admitted that the dance of the bees might not be as meaningful as the dances of the people of the West, but it was a noble thing for me to contemplate. I have spoken of a voice giving me orders or advice and heard it for the first time on the way home. Physically speaking, I was becoming unrecognisable, and when I passed my hands over my face, the face I felt was not my face anymore and the hands my face felt were no longer my hands.
I have an old belly that is covered with deep lesions and wounds. I was less fortunate than other acquaintances due to the deep lesions on my belly and the wounds with which it is covered. I knew who I was but did not know my old belly. I have a sharper and clearer sense MOLLO Y 171 of my identity. I am fond of tough and good cut clothing, particularly those that cleave close to the body and are inseparable from it. I had to part with two pairs of stockings due to cold, damp, trudging, and lack of laundering facilities.
I have blue flesh between the knicker-bockers and the tops of my boots. My boots became rigid due to lack of proper care and my drawers and breeches rotted due to constant contact with my incontinences. I discarded two pairs of drawers (two pairs) and the seat of my breeches before they too decomposed. I often wore my shirt inside out and back to front, and I had four ways of wearing my shirt: front to front right side out, front to back inside out, and front to side inside out. I kept my tie, knotted around my bare
The character 172 SAMUEL BECKETT has a spotted tie, but she can't remember the colour of it. 172 Samuel Beckett has a dilemma when it rains, when it snowed, and when it hailed; she has to choose between leaning on her umbrella and taking shelter under her open umbrella. 172 SamuEL BBeckETT is able to use her umbrella as a shelter and not as a support, due to its watertightness.172 Samuel BecketT is unable to walk without the umbrella's support.172 Samuel BeckETT sometimes gets drenched in the rain and
During heavy rain, I shelter under an umbrella. When my arm is weary of holding up the umbrella, I give it to another hand and use it to keep the blood trickling freely or to draw it over my face. My best thoughts came to me during these halts during the rain. When it became clear that the rain would not stop all day or all night, I built a proper shelter made of boughs and needles of certain conifers. When inside the proper shelters, I could think of nothing but my son's raincoat, which was a trench-coat and filled all space.
 MOLLY 173 prefers sheltering under umbrellas, trees, hedges, bushes, or shrubs for shelter. She prefers to take shelter under umbrella shelters and has no intention of taking to the road to seek help for shelter, indicating that she does not seek help from villages or the peasants. MOLLOY 173 reached home with her fifteen shillings intact after spending two days alone and alone in a place where she was waiting quietly under her umbrella for the weather to clear. She was brutally accosted from behind by a farmer who was wearing an oilskin, bowler hat, and welling
Samukl Beckett was trespassing on someone's land, which was his land, but she did not own it. 174 SAMUKL BECKETT trespassed on someone else's land at night and in bad weather in a place not fit for a dog. 174 Samuel Beckett held a spade with which he threatened to kill Samukl and threatened to shake her. 174 He also seized her by the jacket and by the lapel, threatening to shake and shake her, and he was holding a jacket and lapel in one hand. 174 SamukL Beckett has a reputation for raising her
I lost my infant boy and kept his mamma due to the influence of a woman named Ninette. I owe this to Ninette, whom I consider the Madonna of pregnant women, especially of pregnant married women. I have vowed to thank Ninette for saving my son's life. I asked for a favour from a cattle breeder for hot tea to revive me, which he granted.
MoLLOY has sworn to make a bee-line to her and has made a promise to do so. MOLLOY took a florin from his pocket and gave it to him for a poor-box for charity. MoLLOY owns a plot to own a plot in perpetuity, which is a great thing to own but a great deal of work to maintain it. He skirted the graveyard at night, at a steep lane and in the dark, with a little wind and faint sky, and found a wicket that was locked properly but he couldn't open it.
The key to the hen-house went into a hole but didn't turn, so I burst it open and hurled myself at the hole. I smelled sweet lilacs and primroses and decided to go towards my hives. I found a hive with a sharp roof, steep over-hanging slopes, empty trays, and a dry, dry light ball of honey in a corner of the hive. The bees in the hive had been left out all winter, their honey taken away, without sugar. My hens were dead too, but they were not killed in the same way as the grey one.
Samuel Beckett had keys to Martha's room, but there was no one in there. 176The house was empty and the company had turned off the light. 176 Samuel Beckett decided to let the company keep the light in the house. 176He received a letter from Youdi asking for a report from Gaber and a visit from Father Ambrose, both in the third person. 176After leaving the house, Samuel found a handful of bees, a dust of annulets and wings, some letters from Savory, and found his son in a box of letters at the foot of the stairs. 176Samuel
Hanna is a woman who has been a man for a long time and has heavy debts. Hanna gave me news of Zulu, the Eisner sisters, and Zulu. Hanna knew who I was and was not afraid of me. Hanna talked to me from her window, she never went out, she disliked going out, and she talked about Zulu and Eisner. 1 has crutches and plans to use them to go faster and learn. 1 decides not to light the lamp again and not to go into the garden due to the long May and June days when he lived in the garden. Hanna
The language I was speaking to did not use the words that Moran was taught by his father when he was a child. Initially, I did not understand what the language wanted, but eventually, I understood that it wanted me to write a report. However, the language didn't use words that were taught by Moran's father. I went back into the house and wrote the report after midnight, despite the rain beating on the windows.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has been abused by those who have abused her since she was born. 180 Samuel Beckett has moved to a place where she feels more neutral and inert, where she no longer has to weigh upon the balance. 180 Samuel Beckett still experiences occasional fits of impatience, but she is less given to them since moving to the place she is in now. 180 She believes that she will become natural and not be hot or cold any more, she will pay less heed to herself, and she will be neither hot nor cold, but tepid.
I have an old debtor who owes money to me. I am waiting for him to repay me and while waiting, I will tell myself stories. The stories I tell will be calm and lifeless, devoid of ugliness, beauty or fever, and will be almost lifeless. I look forward to these stories giving me great satisfaction and satisfaction. I have enough money to repay the debt and do not need anything more. I do not forgive anyone and I wish them an atrocious life and hope for them to be honoured in the execrable generations.
The character $ MALONE DIES 181 has been trying to engage in play for nearly a century. Initially, his attempts went well and the players were pleased that someone was interested in playing with them. Eventually, he found himself alone in the dark and decided to play only part of the time from now on. If he doesn't succeed, he plans to play with himself. He plans to tell himself four stories during the night.
The story has a theme of a man, a woman, a third story about a thing, an animal, a bird, and a fourth one about an animal. However, it's possible that the story might not have time to finish. If the story is finished too soon, the remaining items in the possession will be discussed as a kind of inventory. The inventory is a thing that I have always wanted to do and will only take a quarter of an hour if I am short of time.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is planning to leave an inventory of his possessions. He has been planning to do this for a long time and has long dreamed of doing it. He intends to start with the first story about a man and a woman, which will be the first of three stories, followed by one about an animal and one about a thing.
1 used to not know where she was going but knew she would arrive and knew there would be an end to the long blind road. Now the route is well-charted and there is little hope of coming to its end. 1 finds it hard to get used to the idea of losing time or gaining it. 1 has decided to remind herself briefly of her present slate before starting to write stories. 1 considers her past slate as a weakness and plans to add it as a pendant to her inventory. aesthetics is on her side as she needs to become earnest to speak of her possessions.
MALONE DIES 183 has been finding something attractive about the present state of the five stories, three stories, inventory, with an occasional interlude and a full programme. MALONE has been left alone in a room for the past few days. Malone believes the room seems to be hers and believes she has been in it alone for a long time. Malone has listened at different hours of the day and night and has never heard any suspicious or unusual sounds, only the peaceful sounds of men at large.
I find myself in a private room in an ordinary house in what appears to be a plain ordinary house. I do not remember how I got there, possibly in an ambulance or a vehicle. I fainted and lost consciousness, which resulted in a hiatus in my recollections and a temporary hiatus in recollections until I recovered my senses. I have no memory of the events that led up to my fainting and they have left no discernible trace in my mind. I remember walking all my life except for the first few months and since I have been here. I often amused myself by trying to invent events without success
L has been in a kind of coma for six months, possibly due to a blow to the head. L believes she was stunned with a blow in a forest. L has little experience of rooms and finds the room she is in an ordinary room. L feels the sands are running out and believes she is running out. L had a strong sense of being beyond the grave six months ago. If it had been foretold to L that one day she would feel herself living as she does to-day, she would have smiled.
The character intends to write memoirs after completing an inventory. There is a cupboard where her possessions are kept and she can rummage through them, draw them to her, and send them back. Her bed is by a window and she lies turned towards it most of the time. She does not see any fields or hills, but she can see roofs and sky and a glimpse of a street if she cranes. She can hear the sea when it is high and can see into a room of a house across the way. The character has a big shaggy head against the window-pane and long hair.
The moon is familiar to me and I am familiar with her changes of aspect and orbit. I know the hours of the night when I may look for her in the sky and the nights when she will not come. The clouds are varied and there are many birds that perch on the window-sill asking for food. I never give them anything, but they still come. I am left alone and looked after by a hand that leaves a dish for me each day and takes away the dish of the previous day. I eat one time out of two, out of three, on average, when my chamber-pot is
I live in a room with two pots, one of which is a bed and the other a blanket-covered bed. I am never hot, never cold, and I don't wash. If I get dirty, I rub the part of the pot with my finger wet with spittle. I have two pots and I eat and excrete from both of them. In the beginning, a woman inquired about my needs and wants. Eventually, the woman got me a long stick with a hook attached to one end that allows me to control the furthest recesses of my abode. The woman is an old woman
The character in the room has a gaunt hand and part of a sleeve, suggesting that she has passed away. The character believes that when she came into the room for the room, another character came in for her as well. She does not call for separate study. She believes that the other character may have moved out of compassion or affection for her. She doesn't know how long she has been in this room, but she knows that she was very old before she found herself there. She refers to herself as an octogenarian, although she can't prove it. She knows the year of her birth, but
My body is impotent and has no power. I can exert a certain force but find it hard to guide them. I tremble a little, but only a little. I lie on my back, prostrate, supine, with my cheek on the pillow and my cheek resting on the bedstead. My sight and hearing are very bad. I have very bad eyesight and I can only open my eyes to see the sky and smoke of mankind. My senses are trained on me, me, and I am no prey for the senses. I am far from the sounds of blood and breath, immured and
Sapo is the eldest child of poor and sickly parents who often heard their parents talk about what they should do in order to have better health and more money. Sapo's father is a salesman and works as a salesman in a company where Sapo works.Sapo was a precocious boy who was not good at his school lessons and attended his classes with his mind elsewhere or blank, preferring to manipulate concrete numbers.
Mr. Saposcat works in a shop during the evenings and on the Saturday after-noon. His health is poor but not so poor that he can't work in the evenings of the week and the Saturday afternoon. He needs to find work for secretarial work of some kind. His wife suggests that if he does any more work, he might fall ill, which would make it ill for him to work on the Sunday. Mr. Sapo is concerned about the high price of manure, which he believes prevents him from supporting his family in greater com- fort. He suggests to his wife that he might grow vegetables
The Saposcat family lives in a cramped house and saves money on doctor's fees and chemist's bills. They are planning to move to a cottage in the country to save money. The Saposats have a first-born child who is of her province and they are discussing the age of the child.
Mr. Saposcat took over the erroneous figure and murmured it over and over to himself, expressing regret that his son was not more eager to contribute to the place and prepare for his examinations. His wife advised him to focus on preparing his examinations and not his son's salary. Mr. Sapo looked at his father's face and was sad, astonished, loving, disappointed, and con- fident despite all the years he brooded.
Mr. Saposcat is committed to a liberal profession and believes he should not be unfitted for it. His wife sees him more as a doctor for preference and a surgeon. Mr. Sapo has a certain disease, but it's not definite. He plans to look after his wife and family when they are old.
Sapo is a solitary character who has no friends and is on good terms with his little friends who do not love him. Sapo is a skilled boxer and wrestler, a skilled impostor, who often spends his free time in school doing impositions and often doesn't get home before eight o'clock at night. When his master threatened him with a cane, Sapo snatched it from his hand and threw it out of a window due to winter.
Sapo was supposed to be expelled, but he was not. Sapo is a plump rosy boy with thick wrists and ankles. His mother has predicted that one day Sapo will be bigger than his father. I have not been able to find out why Sapo wasn't expelled. I want to put a safe remove between Sapo and the darkness in his story. I intend to make Sapo live as though he had been punished according to his deserts.
Sapo has a big round head with stiff, straight hair and flaxen hair. His eyes are palest blue and his wife suggests he should be a shade lighter. Sapo's father predicted that Sapo will astonish his family one day. Saposcat loves nature and takes an interest in animals and plants, but he doesn't know how to look at them.
Samuel BECKETT is a man who enjoys the flight of a hawk and can distinguish it from all others. Samuel is unaware of the sun, the moon, planets, and the stars, but finds joy from his ignorance of them. Samuel BecketT is fascinated by extremes of need, pride, patience, and solitude.SAMUEL has a light that has just gone on in one of the two windows of the house across the way, one of which he can always see always.
The story takes place in a place where a man has been physically demanding certain movements and has lived with dogs for a period of time. Sapo, a dog, is a companion to the man and has been with the man for a long time. The dogs are old dogs who can't spring after the man when he sets out with his stick at dawn, so they stay in their kennel or basket and listen to the steps of the man. Eventually, the pure air and the sun console the man, and he thinks no more about Sapo until evening when the lights in his house welcome him home.
Mr. Saposcat is a boy who has been brooding on thoughts of sex since the age of 16. His father views him as a prey to the first flutters of sex and his wife sees him as earning his living. Mr Sapo's teachers see his brooding as signs of besottedness pure and simple. His dream is less of girls and more of himself, his own life, and his life to be. Mr. Sapo is easily frightened of gull's eyes, which remind him of an old ship-wreck.
The character has not learned the art of thinking and struggles with doubts, desires, imaginings, fears, and dreads. His studies take up most of his time and he is always last in his classes. His father, Mr. Saposcat, believes that his son is the victim of lascivious speculations and suggests that he should play more games. The character is fond of walking in the country and believes that long walks do him good.
Sapo is a patient, reasonable child who has struggled alone for years to shed a little light upon himself. Sapo is a stranger to the joys of darkness and is fond of light. Adrian, Sapo's mother, is concerned that Sapo has hurt her feelings. Adrian is getting along well with Sapo. Adrian wants to be there a 194 SAMUEL BECKETT before the plunge to say goodbye to the holds where he has lived and his refuge. Adrian has always been sentimental and believes the game is won, having lost all the games he has played.
Mr. Saposcat took private lessons during the morning and left the house in the afternoon to work in the open air during the summer holidays. Once clear of the town, he hid his books under a stone and worked in the countryside during the season when the labours of the peasants reach their paroxysm and the long bright days are too short for all there is to do. The peasants often took advantage of the moon to make a last journey between the fields and the threshing floor or to overhaul the machines to prepare them for the impending dawn.simple interest, compound interest, compounding intervals,
Sapo is a character in a story about a character named Malone. 195Malone has a history of watching people and feeling boredom and terrorized by their presence. 195Sapo has tried to kill, take their place, or flee from them, but eventually decides to wait for the end of the story. 195 Malone was born gravely ill and was born with a disease of earnestness, resulting in him being born grave and ill. 195In the story, Sapo stands on one leg and is depicted as a wild beast, clown, and all alone. 195
I struggled to be grave, to live, to invent, and to try and live without knowing what it was I was trying to achieve. I struggled to escape into the darkness seeking sanctuary and solace in the shadows. I began again with a different aim: to live and cause to live. Nuance is what I sought when I struggled out of my hole and aloft through the stinging air towards an inaccessible boon.
SAMUEL BECKETT is in a relationship with a person he admires and envies, a person far beneath him. SamUel has often made others suffer and been made to suffer by him, and he has suffered every time he left him. Samuel feels that he is forgetting himself again and is trying to forget about his past. He feels he can never tell the past of himself or others, as he has never tried to do so. Samuel is on the verge of vanishing at the same time as the stranger, but he has managed to live long enough to feel other eyes behind his closed eyes
The character in the story is depicted as a character who often stops abruptly and goes off into unexpected directions. The character moves like a big thistle-down plucked by the wind from the place where it had settled. There are two images of the character's actions: he stops abruptly, stands for a moment, and then starts off again. In the story, the character rummaged through his things, sorting them out and drawing them over to him to look at. He initially thought he knew these objects by heart and could speak of them without consulting them. However, he now realizes that the image of these
The story MALONE DIES 197 is a story about an obsession. The story takes place in a room where there is only one piece of furniture capable of intervening between the protagonist and objects, a cupboard. The cupboard is cleaved to the wall and the two walls and seems to be part of them. The protagonist has a button-boot, a kind of boot, in the cupboard, but it is empty and she finds other objects of less value in it, among them a zinc ring that she thought she had preserved.
I don't remember ever having smoked a tobacco-pipc, but I remember a soap-pipe with which I used to blow bubbles as a child. 198 SAMUEL BECKETT tells a story about a time when nature smiles and shines, the rack lets loose its black unforgettable cohorts and sweeps away the blue formemory, a story involving tobacco, a soap pipe, bubbles, an age-yellowed newspaper, rupees, gonococcus, and prostate.
My situation is delicate and I fear that I might miss out on important things due to fear, fear of falling back into an old error, and fear of not finishing /n time. I have a deep thought which has been nagging at me for the past five minutes. My deep thought suggests that the unchanging seeks relief from its formlessness. I ask that the last of mine, as long as it lasts, should have living for its theme. If it begins to run short of life, I will feel it. My body is not ready to make up its mind, but I fancy it weighs heavier on the
Kaspar David Friedrich loves a stormy night with scud and tattered clouds and limpid ground. Kaspar's name brings back memories of him and the names he has given to the night sky. The moon is too far away for Kaspar to see, but he has the patience to wait for it. The wind is strong and the words and images run riot in his head, chasing, flying, clashing, merging, and merging.
The characters have a kind of rhythm and a tune and their eyes are bluish in color. Their eyes are almost facing the wrong way, almost like a bird's, and they have a pillow in their mouth. The characters are buried in the world and know they will find their place there one day. They have a strong desire to leave their happiness and return to the race of men, who come and go often with burdens. They leave the light, the fields they longed to love, and the sky filled with white clouds.
The story is about a family, the Lamberts, who struggle to make ends meet. The family consists of a man, a woman, two children, a boy and a girl, and the father, also known as "Big Lambert". Big Lambert has a third or fourth marriage and is still with his young cousin. Big Lambert is known as a big man and has a reputation for being a bleeder and disjointer of pigs. The father has other children who help him, each according to their means or the humour of the story.
Big Lambert is a man who works for a lower fee than the butcher's and is known to demand no more in return for his services than a lump of gammon or a pig's cheek. Big Lambert often speaks of his father with respect and tenderness, expressing his belief that his father's like will not be seen again once he is gone. His days fall in December and January and February and he waits impatiently for the return of the Saviour's birth, which he believes is unquestionably the birth in a stable. He carries under his arm great knives whetted before the fire the night before, a
Lambert has just dispatched a pig and for days afterwards he could not speak of anything but the pig. Lambert's family feared him because they feared him. Lambert was feared and in a position to do as he pleased, and his young wife had given up trying to bring him to heel. Lambert made life easy for his wife by making things easy for him, often in ways that often appeared to her exorbitant. Lambert threatened to beat his wife if she did not open up to him and at the least show of rebellion, he would run to the wash-house and come back with the battle. Lambert
Lambert's farm is located in a hollow, flooded in winter and burnt to a cinder in summer and lies on a fine meadow that belongs to other peasants living at a distance. Lambert's son, or heir, is a great strapping lad with terrible teeth. Big Lambert has a gift for sticking pigs, but this gift is of no help to him when rearing them. Lambert has long-standing fears for his pigs, fearing the thinning effects of exercise and the effects of daylight.
Sapo, a blind and lean pig, killed a weak pig for ingratitude. Sapo blamed himself for the pig's ingratiation and blamed the pig for being coddled by him. Samuel Beckett used to count up to three hundred, four hundred, and with other things such as the showers, bells, chatter of the sparrows, and other things for the sake of counting, and then divided by sixty to measure time. He no longer devours the world.
The 4voman is engaged in a frantic, frantic task with very little time and very few hands. She has only four or five fingers at the end of each arm and her hands are limp and empty. Her hair is thin, grey, grey and dirty, her face is pale and thin, and she has thin, thin, pale skin. Her movements resemble those of an arm shaking a duster or a rag to rid it of dust.
Sapo is the last of all the MALONE DIES 203 characters. Sapo is a person who gives way to others, giving way to them, within doors and without, and has the ability to drop everything she was doing and start gesticulating when disturbed or disturbed. She often stops whatever she is doing and resumes or sets about some new task, usually resuming or resuming it after stopping. It was summer and Sapo was alone, by the window, with a bowl of goat’s milk on the table and the room was dark despite the door and window open on the great outer
Sapo is in a room filled with the sounds of those at work, the daughter calling to her goats, the father cursing his mule, and the father's mule. Sapo feels a sense of relief when he perceives the silence, which he describes as the heart of the dark, the silence of dust and things that would never stir if left alone. He brings a few poor gifts and lays them on the table before leaving the room. Before Sapo leaves, a hen, possibly a grey hen, ventures into the room, causing Sapo to feel reassured and reassured.
The grey hen often comes alone and is followed by a second, third, or even a fourth hen, all bearing little resemblance to one another in plumage and entasis. Sometimes the grey hen comes alone or one of the grey liens. The grey hens are silent at first, but gradually start to scratch and cluck for contentment and relax their soughing feathers. In order to determine whether there is only one grey hen or more than one, it is necessary for someone to be present when all the hens come running towards Mrs. Lambert as she cries for help.
Sapo spent long hours in an old kitchen observing a big, anxious, ashen bird who was about to be sent flying with a broom and a long line of tattered MALONE DIES 205 washing, swaying and drying in the sun. Sapo felt sorry that he did not understand the importance of the hours he spent in the old kitchen waiting to be on his feet again and in motion, and noted many things, including the bird and the well.
Sapo often goes on a strange walk and often stops and starts, often going through mud. Sapo leaves the Lamberts often without saying goodbye and leaves them unbothered and unrepentant. When Sapo left, a crumpled paper-bag containing a few articles of haberdashery and a bowl of goat’s milk were found on the kitchen-table.
They are able to identify individuals who pass along a remote road with a distance of less than a mile. 206 SAMUEL BECKETT was seen moving away unseen, even in the deep shadow of the trees that bordered the stream. 206 They communicate with one another by communicating through gestures or exchanging signals. 206 The group has the ability to observe events and share their knowledge about them with each other.
Sapo is described as grave and expressionless, with a slight smile and a rictus, and his face always grave or expressionless. Sapo and the other characters in the story share a common bond of feeling a sense of curiosity and curiosity about each other's feelings.Sapo has a dream where he stumbles away from a meadow, passing from light to shadow, from shadow to light, and eventually stopping due to a voice telling him to do so. When Sapo stops, he is blind to the beauty and utility of the earth and the wild many-coloured flowers happy among the crops and
The sound I liked best was the barking of dogs, particularly in the clusters of hovels up in the hills where stone-cutters lived. The dogs of the valley responded to the barking with their gross bay all fangs and jaws and foam. I also enjoyed the brief scattered lights that sprang up on their slopes at nightfall, brighter than the stars and less bright than the moon.
I have yellow hair, yellowed by wax and lack of care, yellow ears and long, hidden lobes. I have a high window which I use as a viewing platform from which I can see two impetuous tufts of yellow hair. I used to be deaf, but for a long time I heard things confusedly, as if the noises of the world had merged into a single noise. I suspect that I have lost the ability to decompose the noises and perceive them as one continuous buzzing noise.
SAMUEL BECKETT is in a hurry and has a short memory. SamUEL has decided not to say anything that might leave him in doubt about his intentions. Samuel has a history of forgetting what he had said and often forgets what he has said. SamuEL has written about himself with the same pencil and in the same exercise-book as he used to write about Samuel. SAMUEL knows practically nothing about Samuel's family, but he knows there is a record of it somewhere.
The character in the scene is a person whose life is just beginning and has his own chronicle, memories, and reason. He has the ability to recognize the good in the bad, the bad in the worst, and to grow gently old and die one day like any other day, only shorter. The setting is dark and the character can barely see the window-pane or the wall forming with sharp contrasts. He can hear the noise of his little finger as it glides over the paper and the different sound of the pencil. He also hears a choir, a song he knows but doesn't know how to play
A song is being played by a woman who has been singing the same song for a long time. The song is dedicated to the honour and glory of the first person who was the first to rise from the dead, referred to in the song as "MALONE DIES 209". The song belongs to the long past and ends with a triumphal cry. It seems to be Easter Week, which coincides with the return of the Seasons. I have the feeling of being deceived by the song, possibly by children. I feel as if I have fallen asleep and can't find my exercise-book, but I still have
I have been having a conversation with a person for over a week and have been repeating a certain phrase, "I shall soon be quite dead at last," which seems familiar to me. I seem to have written this phrase before or spoken it word for word and have familiarity with the previous phrase. I have a plan to live, and cause to live and die, and to play and play at last and die alive. I fear nothing and the dawn was not as slow as I had feared. I saw the pane shiver before the ghastly sunrise, which brings me sunset and sunrise. The exercise-book
I found an exercise-book on the day I needed it. It is ruled in squares and covered with ciphers, symbols, diagrams, and symbols and phrases. Calculations on the first pages seem to stop abruptly, indicating that it is astronomy or astrology. I drew a line and wrote "Soon I shall be quite dead at last," without going on to the next page, which was blank. The pencil I used was an old acquaintance and has five faces, pointed at both ends, and is very short.
Sapo is a character with deep-seated doubt about the natural order of things and is unable to grasp what order is meant. Saposcat has pinned her faith to appearances, believing them to be vain. Sapo has never seen any sign of any divine presence inside her or outside her and has never experienced any signs of divine intervention. She is not averse to departing from herself, but less willing to depart willingly. The summer holidays were drawing to a close and the decisive moment was at hand when the hopes of Sapo were to be fulfilled or dashed to the ground.
The Saposcats believe that a more or less normal if unintelligent youth, once admitted to the study of these pro- fessions, is almost certain to become certified to MALONE DIES 211 exercise them. Mr. Saposcat sold himself a fountain-pen at a dis- count of A Bird and promised to give it to him on the morning of the ex- amination. His wife advised him to let him have the pen the day before to give him time to get used to the nib.
Mr. Saposcat has a medium nib pen, a medium size, which he believes will suit his son if he gets it. The pen is in a box with a yellow beak agape and adorned with a bird's beak. Mr. Sapo is not pleased with the medium nib and initially objects to giving the pen to his son immediately, arguing that his son should have time to get used to it and compare it with the pens of his less-poverished friends.
Sapo arrived at the farm earlier than usual and found his father's big red and white head in a hole or pit he had dug for his dead mule. Sapo's father, Lambert, had dug the hole for his mule, who had died during the night. Edmund came out of the house and joined his father in the hole. The mule’s black corpse was lying on its side with forelegs pointed towards heaven and hind legs drawn up under the belly. Edmund and his father used a pick, shovel, and spade to dig the hole and pulled the body into it.
Edmund was working on a spade and felt a great calm. Sapo sat down before him and rested his head on a table. Louis began to talk and seemed in good spirits. Edmund had bought a mule two years before on its way to the slaughter-house. Lambert predicted that the mule would drop down dead at the first ploughing after the transaction. Lambert is a con-noisseur of mules and considers the eye to be the most important part of the transaction in such matters. Lambert was able to convince the mules to continue to serve in the
Lambert has a mule which has a history of senile sores and has done ten miles. Lambert has been trying to get the mule for two years. Lambert thought he might screw six months and two years out of his mule. Lambert and his son sat at a table in the gloom, talking and listening to each other, far removed from each other. Edmund stopped often to rest, leaning on a spade and looking about him. Lambert went to the slaughter-house where he buys his beasts to buy a loafer.
Edmund and his mother passed each other by in silence as they passed a neighbour to borrow a pound of lentils for their supper. 214 SAMUEL BECKETT passed without a glance and there was nothing to suggest that he had seen them. 214Edmund's mother was thinking of a handsome steelyard that weighed lentils and wondered if it was true. 214She lit a lamp where it stood at its usual place on the chimney-piece beside an alarm- clock and a crucifix. 214The lamp was placed in the middle of a triangle, with the lamp and the lamp being the lowest
Sapo is a character who appears in a scene where a yellow globe is defaced and there is a hole in the wick of a lamp. Sapo is portrayed as a character named Big Lambert. When Sapo was absent, the light from the lamp went out and the outer world went out, causing Sapo to think about her absent son, who she initially mistook for her daughter. When she saw Sapo, Sapo's thoughts flew to the absent one and she set the lamp on the table and began to sort lentils into two piles, creating a heap of lentils that grew larger and
Sapo was engaged in a tedious and futile task of sorting lentils. Sapo decided to stop in the middle of the task because it was the wisest thing to do. She had already done a lot of work and didn't want to undo all the work she had done. Her purpose in the task was to free her lentils from all admixture, which was to rid them of only the greater part of lentils and not all of the other parts. She doesn't know if the tasks are finished or if there are other tasks, other days, of which she can safely say that they are
Lions and pigeons have the ability to escape from a hutch and strike a corpse while being taken out of the hutch by the ears. Hens have more stubborn livers and have been observed to cut off their own heads before collapsing. Pigeons are less impressionable and struggle before choking to death. Mrs. Lambert and Sapo, Lambert's son, entered the kitchen and sat at the table, waiting for Lambert's decision. Lambert declared that he would kill Whitey the next day.
Edmund is a character who has been tasked by Big Lambert to fetch the 216 SAMUEL BECKETT case containing three knives, three in number, which he can use to kill Blackey. His wife and son disapprove of his actions. Mrs. Lambert went back to the door, listened, called, and waited for the flock to respond, but it was a long time before she arrived. After the meal, Edmund went up to bed to masturbate before his sister joined him. Edmund would have slept with his sister, but she was not eager and still young.
Lambert is the only member of the household who has no desire to sleep with anybody. Lambert's daughter went out alone with him and was crouched before the range in a state of dejection. Lambert instructed his daughter to eat the remains of a rabbit out of a pot, which she did with a spoon. Lambert watched his daughter eat the rabbit, but noticed that she was also bringing the spoon from the pot into her mouth and down from her mouth into the pot again. Lambert expressed his intention to kill Whitey and offered to hold his daughter if she wants. Lambert saw his daughter's sad state and went towards
Mrs. Lambert was alone in the kitchen writing a story about the Lamberts, a family who lived in a ruinous old house called Malone Dies 217. The story takes place in a place described as a place known for ruins and ruins. Mrs. Lambert has a history of toil and toiliness and her mind wanders away from this place, wandering among its ruins. When she was alone, she turned down the wick of the lamp before blowing it out because she doesn't like to mow out a lamp that is still hot. Once the lamp was cooled, she stood up and blew
The character has been living in the same house for five or six years with a woman's disease, which she believes to be caused by stress. The house is surrounded by a kitchen where she serves her family, which helps her cope with the daily tribulations of living there. The table at which her family will soon be united, waiting for her to serve them, is ready for use. The moon was gone and the stars were shining, a scene that sometimes solaced her. She went to the well, but the bucket was at the bottom and the windlass locked. Her mind was occupied with her daughter,
I took counsel from an Israelite on the subject of conation when I was looking for someone to be faithful to and loyal to. The Israelite's name was Jackson. Jackson had a pink and grey parrot named "Nihil in intellects etc." which he tried to teach to say the first three words of the connotation, but the parrot was unsuccessful. I have no further use for Jackson.
Polly is in a cage with many features, including perches, swings, trays, troughs, stairs, and cuttle-bones. Jackson called Polly the merino, possibly because of the French expression merino. Polly's relationship with Jackson was short-lived and Jackson found Polly disgusting. Polly tried to find a kindred spirit among the inferior races, red, yellow, and chocolate. Polly also tried to interact with the plague-stricken, but she failed due to their ease of access. Polly has a fondness for old people, particularly crying babies.
I am stuck in a situation where I feel impotent and feel like I am in chains. If I had the use of my body, I would throw something out of a window. I do not know what floor I am on, possibly on the mezzanine. I know that the living are above me and beneath me and that I am not in a basement. I sometimes see the sky and other windows facing it through my window. The space which I take to be the street in reality is only a wide trench or ditch with other vaults opening upon it.
SAMUEL BECKETT believes that there are multitudes of fine babies whose parents keep moving about from one place to another to prevent them from forming a habit of motionlessness. SAMUEL believes that the parents are preparing their babies for a day when they will have to move about unai ded.SAMU ELIZABETT has no proof that the noises that he hears come from below and the steps that he says come climbing towards him are real, which makes him hesitate to conclude that he is prey to hallucinations.
I have been having troubles and feel that my troubles are nearly over. However, my horse-sense suggests that I am still struggling with various issues related to my possessions, my system of nutrition and elimin- ation, the environment, a couple across the way, the changing sky, and possibly my worms. I find the light that reigns in the den to be bizarre and I enjoy a kind of night and day, often in a different way from the way I was accustomed before I found myself there.
The light turned out to be the dusk and the sun and the sky instead of rising higher and higher in the sky. The night, which I had just celebrated after the passing of, calmly fell again. I confess to having never experienced this phenomenon before. I have pleasured night to fall all the livelong day and day to break all the night, but I have never experienced it. I feel it is my duty to say that it is never light in this place, never really light.
The light is as bright under my bed as it is under the ceiling. There is no colour in this place except for a kind of grey incandescence, which I consider to be a colour. I have no objection to referring to grey as a colour and am open to the idea that grey and black are related. According to the time of day, the colour of the light in the room does not depend on the time. I am very grey and sometimes have the feeling that I emit grey, the same way as my sheets. My night is not influenced by the sky and my space is not visited by the
There are two light sources from the outer world: those who know the sun and moon and those who rely on clouds. There is a light source from the inner world, which seems to be the light of those who have knowledge of these things. The light from this world has alternations, its dusks and dawns, and it seems to have lived out there once. My own light source is limited to artificial 222 S AMU EL BECKETT light. I can't make light without a lamp or a torch, and I don't know if the air in this place lends itself to combustion.
I am in a head with an arc of solid bone that encloses a six-plane structure. However, the head is not mine, but a kind of air circulates in the head. I can hear it beating against the walls and being beaten back by waves and other onslaughts. The sound of these waves can be interpreted as a faint sound of aerial surf or a sudden storm, similar to the cries of the children, the dying, and the lovers. The skull is not a vacuum, and if I close my eyes, I can get caught up in the swirling eddies created by the air currents
I lost my pencil after trying to retrieve it for forty-eight hours. My pencil is a Venus-shaped with five or six facets, pointed at both ends, and short enough to fit between my thumb and two adjacent fingers. What mv stick lacks is a prehensile proboscis like the nocturnal tapir’s. I think that if I lose my pencil more often, it might improve my mood and make me more cheerful. MALONE DIES 223 brought me the solution and conclusion of the whole sorry business of Malone (since that's what I am now called).
The lead of the pencil I use frequently is hard, yellow, sharp, sharp and brittle, with yellow nails. I have another pencil made in France, a long cylinder with a soft fat lead, which I keep in the bed with me somewhere. Recently, while hunting for my pencil, I made a curious discovery: the floor is whitening and I struck it with a stick, causing a sharp and dull sound. My pencil is getting weaker by the day and I worry about its durability.
The sand kept trickling away and the pencil was gone. I noticed that all the superficies, horizontal and perpendicular, had visibly blanched since my last examination from 224 SAMUEL BECKBTT. I believe that things in general darken as time wears on, with the exception of mortal remains and certain parts of the body which lose their natural colour and fade in the long run. I also noticed a gleam and shimmering of bones within the confines of the gloom, which was not previously the case.
The paper-hangings or wall-paper was covered with a writhing mass of roses, violets, and other flowers. However, these flowers are now completely gone from the ceiling, leaving only cupids. I remember a moment when my exercise-book, almost a child's, fell to the ground and I recovered it by slipping the hook of my stick into one of the rents in the cover and hoist- ing it gently towards me. During this time, a series of incidents and mishaps in my head caused me to believe that all was streaming and emptying away as though through a sl
1 MALONE DIES 225 is a person who has always groped and whose movements have always been akin to groping. She has always believed that she has grasped the true nature of her absurd tribulations, but she was deceived into thinking she had grasped it finally. She is not reproachful of her actions despite her belief that it is easy and beautiful and that all will grow dark again. 1 Malone Dies 225 sees her particles being removed grain by grain until they trickle back into the same place, reminiscent of a hand playing with them.
I have experienced many strange and baseless things, some of which are better left unsaid. I have gone liquid and become like mud at times and others when I would be lost in the eye of a needle and hard and contracted. I was speaking then of my little pastimes and thoughts about contenting myself with them instead of launching forth on controversial topics like life and death. I had a private idea about the subject when I began, but it went out of my head and I would have held my peace if it hadn't begun.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has a dream to get acquainted with free carbonic gas. He is an old foetus, hoar and impotent, his mother is done for, his father is at a party, and he believes he will land head-foremost in the charnel-house. Samuel has always dreamed of getting a job and having a good job and a good life. His dreams have always been tied together with many strings and never a shaft, tying them to his belief that he will never get bom and never get dead.
I was born and lived a long life and met Jackson. I have wandered in towns, the woods and wildernesses, walked in the seas, islands, and peninsulas, seen brief yellow lights of man and the great white and coloured beams of light from caves, crouched on the sand in the lee of the rocks, smelled seaweed and wet rock, walked on the beach softly clawing the shingle, and was not happy, wishing the night would never end and morning would never come. Regardless of whether I was born, lived, or merely died, I will continue doing as I have always done.
I have found him again after a long time. I ran into him in the heart of a town and found him sitting on a bench in the middle of a park. I know he is male and living with that evening life which is described as a convalescence. I remember the days of the underground railway and scavenging for warmth and reasonably edible scraps. I slip into him to learn something and hope to find traces of what was before I found him. I have taken time to find him again and don't know how I did it.
There was a time in my life when the bakers were often indulgent, at close of day and baking-apples were often available. I was a great man for apples and provided shelter, sunshine and shelter for those who needed them. However, a sudden rage and roar from the bakery caused me to find myself lost in forests of high threshing ferns or wind-swept wastes. There was a man found on a bench dressed in a well-made and well-groomed greatcoat, with only fifteen buttons set at intervals of three or four inches.
The character 228 SAMMEL BERTETT is wearing a coat with a fringe that ends in a fringe. 228Samuel's feet are partially hidden inside the fringe of the coat. 228SAMMEL's posture is stiff and set, similar to that of the Colossus of Memnon, the dearly loved son of Dawn. 228The posture of SAMUEL resembles that of a Colossus, with a stiff, set posture and tails sweeping the ground and rustling like a train when he walks.228Samuel wears a large rag arc of a piece with sleeves that are of velvet or shag, frayed and
The coat is described as an overcoat or cover-me-down, suggesting that it was once a greatcoat or overcoat. The coat is of a fine plain green colour, what you might call cab green. There used to be cabs and carriages in the town with panels of a handsome bottle green, which I have seen and driven in. The buttons of the coat are of wooden cylinders, two or three inches long, with a hole in the middle for the thread, and they are not genuine buttons.
The lappets MALONE DIES 229 are roughly two and a half inches long and made of felt. The material of the coat is felt and the various dints and bulges caused by the spasms and contortions of the body persist long after the fit is past. The hat is a buff and pearl grey with a wide crack or rent extending from the crown down and intended to facilitate the introduction of the skull. However, the hat is too small and attached by a string to the topmost button on the coat for safety.
The hat once belonged to a sporting gentleman who was a turf-man or breeder of rams. The coat and the hat were bought at the same place possibly on the same day and possibly by the same tailor. The hat and the coat were bought by fine handsome men, six foot tall and over, but with a small head due to over-breeding. Sapo is no longer referred to as Sapo.
Macmann has been sitting under a surtout since morning and has been there since evening. 230 SAMUEL BECKETT for Macmann is not much better. 230 Macmann's back is turned to the river and he does not stir, but he is aware of the tugs, black funnels striped with red, that tow to their moorings the last barges, freighted with empty barrels, and the distant fires of the sunset, orange, rose, and green, quenching them in ruffles and then spreading them bright again. 230 Samuel Beckett's face is towards the people
Even those who know themselves to be condemned to the same direction, even if they choose a different path, are willing to part with one another and part politely. They all know one another's little ways and are familiar with each other's paths. They walk side-by-side happily, even muttering to each other, indicating a mutual understanding of each other’s little ways. At this hour, erotic craving accounts for the majority of couples, but these are few compared to the solitaries pressing forward through the throng, obstructing the access to places of amusement and waiting for their appointed place.
The journey of the horse involves three stages: the journey to the rendezvous, the journey home or to the hotel, and the journey back. The journey takes the horse from its previous career as a pet horse, or a race horse, to a pack-horse or a plough-horse. The horse spends most of its time standing still in an attitude of dejection, its head hanging low and its head almost to the cobble-stones. Once in motion, the horse is transformed momentarily by the memories that motion brings, possibly because of the memories it revives. When a fare has been taken on
The character is described as a horse-riding character who is angry and frustrated with the lack of passengers. The character has the ability to tear the reins from his horse's back and launch his equipage blindly through the dark thronging streets of the city. Each passenger has his own reasons for going to the appointed place. SAMUEL BECKE's character has a horse with a crack all along its back, dark streets, and curses.
Macmann is observing a phenomenon where windows and shop- windows light up almost instantaneously after the setting sun depending on the season. Macmann prefers summer to winter and prefers autumn to spring. According to Macmann, the observed phenomenon is a true spring evening with an equinoctial gale howl along the quays and high red houses and warehouses.
A character is in a place where he is unlikely to move again and has the whole of his old age ahead of him. There is an epilogue to his story which is not clear and does not add to what has already been acquired or shed any light on its purpose. He will rise from this place and proceed by other places to another pjacc, and then by others still to yet another, and so on, on, for long years. In order to survive, one must come and go, and in order to do so, one needs someone who brings them food.
Macmann believes that ignorance is bad policy as it adds to his pains. Macmann is concerned only with certain things, such as those that appal him. According to Macmann, on the fifth day, when the problem of how to rise is decided, the fourth and third days do not matter. In this scenario, Macmann has to drag himself to the nearest plot of vegetables using tufts of grass and asperities of the earth.
Samuel Beckett's eyes are red, worn, and hard set to meet, with four red lids, two for each eye. Samuel Beckett doesn't possess the means of accumulating enough food to keep him alive for more than three weeks or a month. Even if he did, he would not be able to employ them because he feels far away from the future. Samuel has waited a long time for something and feels as if he has waited for it in vain. Samuel's eyes close with a gentle suddenness and often without anger.
Lachrymal sees the heaven of an old dream, the sea and the earth, the spasms of the waves from shore to shore, and the different motion of men who are not tied together but are free to move around freely. When one dies, the others continue on as if nothing had happened. Malone believes his stories are all in vain and that he is still alive and breathing in and out of the air. Malone has felt his hour is at hand and has felt it for a long time, even in the days when he felt it was past.
The story takes place in two or three days and is set in the language of the days when they taught me the names of days and taught me how to tell the time. In this language, the days are few and seem like a joke. I believe I have reached the month of May, which I believe comes from Maia, the goddess of increase and plenty. May is associated with the midsummer moon and the harvest, which comes later in the season. I am currently at All Saints in the middle of the chrysanthemums, where I will not hear the howling of the wolves.
My feet are so far away that it would take me over a month to call them in to be cleaned. My fingers have the ability to write in other latitudes and the air that breathes through my pages turns them without my knowledge when I doze off, causing the subject to fall far from the verb and the object to land somewhere in the void.
When I was a virgin, the nozzle from which sperm and clouts and gouts of sperm came streaming and splashing into my face was a source of a con- tinuous flow. Now, as a result of uraemia, I would be dead of the flow due to the effects of the disease. I do not expect to see my sex again, even with the naked eye. I have a certain expectation of never seeing it again. If I were to stand up again, my extremities would recede and I would fill a specific part of the universe.
I have 236 SAMUEL BECKETT stories to tell. I continue to fit in a room, let's call it a room. I remember the window that sometimes looks as if it were painted on the wall, like Tiepolo's ceiling at Wurzburg. I have seen my old head swing out through the door, low and lower, each time it bangs against the jamb. I am tall and the door is low, lower and lower in my opinion. The landing of the room is small and the man carrying my feei has to start turning before he starts down the stairs to avoid
Bob is a character who doesn't know me and doesn't have any personal knowledge of me. The event is past, but it's too soon to use it. Despite the delay, Bob believes he can say nothing that is not true and believes that he can testify to the truth of his actions. Bob likes his ability to say things that others can't, which is what he likes about himself. Bob can say things such as "Up the Republic!" or "Sweetheart!" without thinking about the consequences.
Malone is expected to die in two or three days. Malone has a sudden desire to see something, anything, no matter what, as he used to do in the past. Malone is planning to end the lives of Murphys, Merciers, Molloys, Morans, and Malones. Malone wants to defunge and see how many people he has killed, whether by hitting them on the head or setting fire to them. Malone can only think of four people, all unknowns, and only one of them had a name. Malone killed an old butler in London with a razor blade,
The setting is described as a dirty white and vaulted den with dirty white walls and a vaulted ceiling. The surroundings are described as dirty white, vaulted, and hollowed out of ivory. The characters in the story seem to be trapped in a place where they can't reach each other. They could be reunited, reunited, done with parting and done with prying on one another, or they could be as alone as they were when they left. I can see the characters clamoring after me down the corridors, stumbling through the rubble, pleading for me to take them with me. I have just time to
The character 238 SAMUEL BECKETT is in a room that appears to be a porthole or bull's-eye shape. The room is dark and often darker than before, and the sky is a black night with few stars. The character believes that the black night is truly of mankind and not merely painted on the window-pane. The stars in the sky tremble like true stars, indicating they would not be painted if they were true stars. Occasionally, the window across the wav lights up or the light from the window is lit up, indicating the outer world.
I am in a place where nothing happens and the sky is full of tumult and violence. I have the whole night before me to follow the slow fall and rise of other worlds and watch out for meteors. I can see two entities standing up against each other behind a dark curtain. They cleave so fast together that they seem a single body and a single shadow. When they cleave, it is clear they are two distinct and separate bodies, each enclosed within its own frontiers.
The scene takes place in a room with a complicated shape made up of more than one element. The shape sways and totters and is poor in colour, but the night must be warm for a flare of tender colour, pale blush and white flesh, pink from a garment, and gold from a gold-coloured gold-plated object. The characters in the scene seem to be in love with each other, indicated by the fact that they rub against each other.
Macmann was caught by the rain and decided to lay down due to the risk of getting uniformly wet. Macmann believes that if he stood up, he would get uniformly wet all over. He believes his vulnerable parts, including the neck, back, chest, and belly, are more vulnerable to the rain than standing due to their intimate and indissolubly bound up together. He also believes that a drop of water on the coccyx could lead to spasms of the risorius lasting for years.
Macmann is standing in a heavy, cold, and perpendicular rain in a bog-water in an after-noon, possibly in the afternoon, surrounded by leaden light and still air with no promise or memory of warmth. Macmann has been telling himself a story about SAMUEL BECKETT all his life. Samuel Beckett is described as a violent character with a white front, white back, and white front covered with dust.
The rain pelted down on his back with a sound similar to the sound of a drum. His ear is glued to the earth and he can distinguish the difference between the rain and the earth's noise. The rain caused him to think about punishment and the idea of punishment. He felt guilty about his sin and felt that living was not a sufficient atonement for it. He had consented to live in his mother's house and felt guilty for the memory of his having consented.
The character sees his sin as another atonement which has miscarried and has plunged him deeper into guilt and fear. The character is often in a state of confusion about his guilt and punishment, confused about cause and effect and how to deal with them. He is often afraid and in fear of the consequences of his actions, fearing that his actions will cost him dear. In his struggle to think and feel correctly, the character would suddenly smile for no reason, as if it had been long since an afternoon in March, or in November, or even in October, when the rain caught him far from shelter and he was
Macmann was surprised by the heavy rain but did not regret his decision not to under-stand the rain and continue on his course, hoping for a tree or a ruin. Macmann believes that he is no more than human, more than the son and grandson and greatgrandson of humans. He believes that his semen has never done any harm to those he has touched, despite the threat of the rain.
SAMUEL BECKETT has a link with his species only through fiis ascendants, who are all dead and beyond the power of Macmann. 242 SAMUEL believes that true men, true links, acknowledge the error of their ways and hasten on to the next, which is beyond Macmann's power. 242 Samuel believes that he could have waited until the end of time and not done anything wrong and that he has waited long enough for the time when nothing more can happen and all is ended. 242Samuel believes that when one dies, it's too late, unless one has been watching
In a wild and practically illimitable part of the country, when lying on one's stomach, there is a sideways movement of the whole body, including the head, unless one makes a point of avoiding it. When lying on a narrow bed, such as a pallet, the head always remains in the same place, even when the body turns over on its back. The head comes to rest at x inches from where it was before, the x being the width of the shoulders in inches, and the head lies in the middle of the shoulder-width of the bed.
Malone's hands are described as having a flat surface similar to the grass and his hair is described as being as long as the hour’s gloom to black and very long, with a very long behind and either side of his hair being very long. MALONE DIES 243 has pulled up his sleeves to clutch the grass during a rainstorm and feels the rain pelting down on his palms. Malone's hair would have been romping in the grass on a dry and windy day, but the rain glued it to the ground and churned it into a muddy pulp, turning the grass into
A character is suffering under a heavy, cold, and perpendicular rain and is questioning if he was mistaken in holding it responsible for his suffering.^ The character deplores spending his life under the rain and wonders if his discomfort might be the result of a different cause or set of causes.^ People are never content to suffer, but they must have heat and cold, rain and its contrary, fine weather, love, friendship, black skin and sexual and peptic deficiency, and furies and frenzies too numerous to be numbered.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is described as having an earthy and earthy temperament, more reptile-like and ill-fitted for the circumstances in which he was born. SAMUUEL has the ability to suffer extensive mutilation and survive it. SamUUEL is more comfortable sitting than standing and lying down and prefers to lay down and only rise again when the need for life or struggle for life begins to prod him. SAMU EL has a motionlessness akin to that of stone and a sensibility and understanding similar to a stone, suggesting a vegetative system inherited from his numerous ancestors. SAMUL
He is a person who has no one to help him avoid the pitfalls and pitfalls that accompany the steps of innocence. He relies solely on his own strength to avoid mortal harm. He has never received any gifts of cash and rarely receives even paltry gifts. When given the task of weeding a plot of young carrots at a low rate of three, five, or sixpence per hour, he often destroys the plots because of an irresistible urge to cleanse the plot of vegetables and flowers.
Malone is a protagonist who struggles to distinguish useful plants from useless weeds. Malone is unable to distinguish the plants destined for the embellishment of the home or the nutrition of man and beast from the weeds which are said to serve no useful purpose. Malone has a nature as a scavenger and has failed to achieve his goals due to his scavenging nature. Malone's work as a street-cleaning worker leaves the place he cleans dirtier at his departure than at his arrival. Malone believes a demon has driven him to collect dirt and filth from the spot where he was employed.
The individual responsible for a sector was not master of his movements and did not know what he was doing while doing it nor what he had done, once he did it. He was following the example of his more experienced colleagues, taking as his model the actions of those more experienced in the sector. The result of his actions was that the sector was littered with peels of oranges, bananas, cigarette-butts, unspeakable scraps of paper, dogs' and horses' excrement, and other muck.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is made of green wood and exposed to the rigours of the temperate zone.SAMUEL has the ability to repair or replace his buttons or pegs with his bare hands. Samuel has devoted a great part of his existence to these little tasks and has devoted more than a quarter of it to these tasks. Samuel believes that he had to perform these tasks if he wanted to continue his existence on the earth. Samuel believes that God does not require reasons for doing what he does and for omitting to do what he omits to do.
Mac-Mann is capable of weeding a bed of pansies or marigolds and leaving one standing, yet being able to consolidate his boots with willow bark and thongs of wicker. Mac-Mann is able to walk on the earth and not hurt himself on stones, thorns, and broken glass caused by carelessness or wickedness of man. However, he is incapable of picking his steps and choosing where to put down his feet.
Macmann is in a place impermeable to wind, rain, sound, cold, great heat, and daylight. Macmann's hat is tied to his coat and the string of the hat twisted itself about his neck, but the hat remained where it was tied. A charitable soul visits Macmann once a week with eating-apples and sardines in oil for the purpose of postponing his fatal hour.
Macmann has lost his hat due to a high wind and is rolling across a dry and light plain. Macmann is moving along an arc of a gigantic circle along which one of his extremities is heavier than the other. As he moves away from the place where the rain had caught him, Macmann advances with regularity and even rapidity along the arc of the circle. He has developed a plan to continue rolling on all night if his strength should fail and approach the confines of the plain.
 SAMUEL BECKETT possesses a pencil, two pencils, an exercise-book, a stick, a table, a dish, pots, dishes, cups, and blankets, and a cupboard in Spain, among other things. Samuel doesn't know where the pencil comes from and she didn't have it when she first came to Spain. She considers it hers.
I used to rub myself against an object referred to as a "little woman" under the bed. The object is so long that it sticks out under the pillow and finishes far behind me. The room is dark and I can't see the window letting in the night. I have a needle stuck into two corks to prevent the object from sticking into me. Around the shank, between the corks, there is a wisp of black thread that turns out to be the bowl of my pipe.
The pipe that was thrown away had broken, the stem having broken off just short of the bowl. The bowl was found in the grass. I have a feeling of pity for the bowl, possibly due to feelings of pity I have for things, especially portable things in wood and stone. I often felt a strong desire to have these portable things around me and keep them always, which led to me picking them up and putting them in my pocket, often with tears. I wept up to a great age and felt that I had never evolved in the fields of affection and passion, despite my experiences. I picked up
In the past, when I could walk without a stick and without crutches, I loved to walk with my hands deep in my pockets and to touch and talk to the hard shapely objects that were in them. I used to fall asleep holding a stone, a horse chestnut or a cone and would still hold it when I woke up. I also loved to throw away objects which were worn out or were ousted by new loves. I would search for a place to lay these objects where they would be at peace forever.
Samuels BecketT has a style of disposing things he loves but can no longer keep due to new loves. In 250 SAMUEL BECKETT how one chokes, Samuel Beckett describes disposing of things he loved due to his new loves and hiding them so well that even he could never find them again. Samus Beckett has a bowl that he used as a receptacle for his loved objects, he kept things in it and made a cap for it out of tin, but he never got rid of the bowl.
A bird tells me that a paraclete, a psittaceously named, has named a club. The club is mine and stained with blood, stained with insufficiently, insufficently, and insufferable amounts of blood. I have defended myself, ill, but I've defended myself. There are moments when I feel like I have been here always, perhaps even was born here. One of my boots, originally yellow and originally yellow, has gone and they took it away before they realized I would never walk again.
I have preserved a yellow boot with a remarkable number of eyeholes, but it is no longer mine. I know the whereabouts of only those things which I know well enough to be able to lay hold of and define as my possessions. The yellow boot is the only one I have preserved and the other ones are useless, having ceased to be holes and become slits. I can identify objects by touch and access them by hooking a stick to the desired object and bringing it to the bed.
My hat has lost its brim and is the only object in my possession with a history I have not forgotten, dating back to the day it became mine. My hat has a unique shape resembling a bell-glass to put over a melon and is difficult to put on and take off, requiring one to grasp it like a great ball between their palms. I consider putting the hat on on the off chance that it can be put on before it's too late. I feel I am attributing to myself things I no longer possess and reporting as missing others that are not missing. I believe there are others, belonging to
 SAMUEL BECKETT has survived in a room where some things go out and others come back after a prolonged absence. Samuel has been in this room for a long time and is not familiar with the objects that come in and out of it. SamUEL has a family of objects that have never left him and have remained quietly in their place in the corner of the room, just like in any ordinary uninhabited room. SamuEL is uncertain about the nature of his possession and his understanding of what is his and what is not, and he wonders if he should continue drawing up an inventory corresponding
Malone is half asleep and considers taking all his possessions into bed with him. Malone believes he has always had that resource. Malone has a photograph of an ass, taken from in front and close up, at the edge of the ocean.scrupulous, night, counsel, decision, rectifi- cations
The ocean is portrayed as a creature with thin hard parallel legs, thin, parallel legs and thin hooves light and dainty on the sand. The ocean is not pleased with the camera operator's attempts to make it raise its head to impress on the celluloid. There is no trace left of an individual's clothes apart from a boot, a hat, three socks, and a flannel that Mr. Quin gave to the character. The character has lost her clothes, including her greatcoat, trousers, and flannel, and she doesn't feel well. She considers going out but believes it is a passing weakness.
It has been some days since my soup was renewed and I haven't eaten it yet. I have been trying to make my table to the door and move it to and fro in an attempt to make noise that would be heard and correctly interpreted in the right quarters. One of the pots in the dish remains empty, the other one is filling slowly and it is unlikely that I will ever be able to fill them both. Since I have stopped eating, I produce less waste and eliminate less. The pots do not seem to be mine, they answer to the defin- ition of what is mine.
I have a lot of possessions, including pots, a bed, a bicycle-bell, a half-crutch, and a win- dow. 254 SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that when an old man cannot swallow any more, they are given vitaminized pap to prevent them from being accused of murder. 254 Samuel Beckett believes that he will die of old age pure and simple, glutted with days as in Tjie days before the flood, on a full stomach. 254 He sees an old woman, an old yellow arm, and for a time an old YellowLively.
There is a deep hole where there is a vast emptiness and the earth seems uninhabited. There are no living people within a radius of one hundred yards. The only sounds are the sounds of things. The hole is deep enough that it is possible to imagine oneself as the last of human kind. If I started to scream, I would try to draw attention to myself to find out if there is someone nearby. I have spoken softly, gone my ways softly, all my days as one who has nothing to say, nowhere to go and nothing to gain by being seen or heard.
I choose to say only a small proportion of the things that seem similar to the most important to me. I wonder if I shall ever be able to stop saying certain things and if I can ever stop saying them. I have a lead, a small amount of lead, that I can't retrieve. I consider taking away this lead, but it's a risk I don't feel inclined to take. I think about moving my bed, which is narrow and possibly on castors, and steering it through a door and down the stairs if there are stairs that go down. The dark is against me, but I can
I lost my stick. The stick had slipped and would have plucked me from the bed if I hadn't let it go. I realize that the fear of falling is the source of many folly and that losing the stick would have been better for me to relinquish my bed. Now that I have lost the stick, I realize what it meant to me and ascend to an understanding of the Stick.
Samuel Beckett is a character who has a stick that he uses to control his decomposition. 256SAMUEL has the ability to turn his stick to the best possible account, similar to a monkey scratching its fleas with a key that opens its cage. 256Samuel has a strong desire to stay in his bed and has no desire to leave it, unusual for a sage. 256After a brief bout of discouragement, Samuel falls asleep and one of the thieves is saved by the stick.
I have lost my exercise-book, lead and French pencil. I feel less weak, suggesting they fed me while I slept. I have a pot that is not full and is lost to me. I once had a phial, un- labelled, containing pills, but I forget what they were. I remember thinking about turning to them for calm and only obtaining apoles.
Macmann has a plan to retrieve his stick but is unsure how to do it due to his weak state. 257Macmann is in a kind of asylum, which he was told about when he was in a condition to receive news. 257The asylum is located in the House of Saint John of God, with the number one hundred and sixty-six. 257If Macmann's plan doesn't work, he will try and get himself out of the bed. 257In the asylum, there is an imperial half pint of porter and plug of.
Macmann is described as a man who has eluded charity all his life and has been credited with a certain number of prerogatives and has received bounties for his services. Macmann is in a room, or cell, in which he is surrounded by a large crowd of men and women dressed in white. The speaker of the conversation has features stamped with mildness and severity, and a scraggy beard intended to heighten his resemblance to the Messiah. He does not read or memorize, relying instead on a paper he holds in his hand and an indelible pencil, which he hands to Mac
The speaker's name is Mann and his name is Macmann. A woman named Moll is standing behind him, holding a bar in support of SAMUEL BECKETT of the bed. Moll's name means "nice name" and she is a little old woman with ill-favoured features. The speaker is irritated and out of sorts, expressing his dislike for Moll and her name. The room is filled with spectators trying to push past the speaker to get out through the door.
Macmann is involved in a role-play scenario involving a character named Moll. Moll has a deformable body, thin yellow arms contorted by some kind of bone deformation, broad and thick lips, and a mouth so thick that it seems to devour half the face. She wears earrings with two long ivory crucifixes which sway wildly at the slightest movement of her head. Macmann is committed to the care and charge of this person referred to as "one hundred and sixty-six". Moll applied for Macmann formally and has been given control of him
Moll is a character who informs Macmann when he does or doesn't do something and when he remains inert. Moll was present when Macmann did something and informed him when it was permitted or not. However, Moll did not stay with Macmann all the time due to her other interests. She left him alone as little as possible and watched over him part of the night. Macmann was wearing a long loose smock of coarse linen or possibly drugget and was distressed when his clothes ceased to exist and could not be returned to him.
Macmann's belongings found in the pockets were deemed worthless and were to be thrown away with the exception of a silver knife-rest. However, his clothes, cleaned, pressed, mended, strewn with mothballs, and folded away in a cardboard box bearing his name and number, are safe and safe, as if they had been received in deposit by the Bank of England. Macmann was distressed by these declarations and demanded his things despite being told by the officer that his belongings were safe. Eventually, the officer left Macmann to retrieve a hat from a vegetable-garden, which she found fringed with
Moll helped Macmann to put on a hat that was abandoned in the middle of the plain. The hat is the selfsame hat that Macmann was wearing before it was abandoned. Moll is a Macmann and has a deep affection for Macmann. She helped him to put the hat on and assist him to sit up in the bed, arranging his pillows so that he could remain propped up without fatigue. She contemplated with tenderness the old face relaxing, the mouth trying to smile, and the little red eyes turning timidly towards her.
Macmann has been in the House of Saint John of God for a long time and is currently in the third phase of his stay there. Macmann is in a state of fear and uncertainty, fearing to fall foul of the authorities. The first phase of Macmann's stay was characterized by the evolution of the relationship between Macmann and his ball.
Macmann and Moll have known each other for 60 years. They are in their mid-twenties and have very little experience of carnal love. Despite their inexperience, Moll is the more expansive of the two and is capable of expressing her love for Macmann. Macmann tries to bundle his sex into his partner's like a pillow into a pillow-slip, folding it in two and stuffing it in with his fingers. Despite being completely impotent, they manage to achieve sexual satisfaction despite their struggles. Moll believes that they would have met 60 years ago if they had not met.
Macmann was brought into an enchanted world of reading thanks to the inflammatory letters which Moll brought and put into his hands. Macmann's memories of school are so tenacious that he was able to dispense with the explanations of his correspondent and understand all the messages he received. Moll held a little aloof while Macmann read an inflammatory letter and waited until the 262 SAMUEL BECKETT rustle of the sheet going back into the envelope announced that he had finished. When Macmann finished, Moll turned eagerly towards him to see him raise the letter to his lips or press it against his heart
I have the key to the medicine cupboard. I have met this person seventy years ago. I believe that if we had met each other 70 years ago, we would not have grown to loathe each other. I can't get over the fact that this person has led a chaste and sober life.
MALONE DIES 263 considers that the flesh is not the end-all and the be-all in their age, especially at their age. Malone Dies 263 considers herself ugly and misshapen, and her Papa used to say that people would run a mile away from her. Despite being physically attractive, Malone has never been beautiful or well-proportioned, and she was once described as ugly and even ugly. Malone believes that she and Malone are scarcely less hideous than their best-favored contemporaries, with the passing of the years.
Macmanicus is an old man who has a strong preference for tetty-beshy. Moll, also referred to as "Sucky Moll", is another character in the story. Macmanicus expresses his feelings for Moll three or four times a week through letters and other means, but he has never responded to these letters. Macmann has feelings for his mistress, who he feels is drifting away from him. He has begun composing brief rimes of structure to offer his mistress.
Examp and Sucky Molly are characters in Examp’s story. 264 SAMUEL BECKETT and Hairy Mac are characters who share a love story which involves a romantic relationship between them. 264Hairy Mac has written a number of romantic works which highlight the idea of love as a kind of lethal glue, a concept common in mystic texts. 264Macmann's love for Moll initially seems repugnant and repulsive to him, but he develops feelings of pleasure for her lips months later. 264Moll exerted herself in tireless ardours during this period, which may explain why
Moll has mistaken Macmann for a man and is seeking to end their sexual relationship in order not to shock him. Macmann perceives Moll as only a female and not a man, which is why he initially questioned why two Christs, implying that one Christ is sufficient for him. Moll and Macmann had a brief period of warmth and coolness during their sexual relations, indicating an equality of temperature.
Moll claims to have a long yellow canine carved with a drill to represent the sacrifice of Christ. Moll fears that she might have swallowed a crucifix and is worried about the possibility of swallowing it. Macmann is depicted as having two ears. Macman and Moll fell in love with each other, expressing deep affection for each other and regret about their liaison.
The story takes place in SAMUEL BECKETT'S room and involves a character named Moll. 266Moll was once a living being who was able to desire little, but she has changed and is no longer able to find pleasure in her current state. 266Samuel Beckett has a strong desire to kill Moll, expressed through his words and actions. 266After cleaning up after cleaning up, Moll sat down on a chair in the middle of the room and did not respond to Samuel Beckett when he called her. 266When Samuel Becket called Moll to him, she perched on
Moll is pregnant and her hair is falling out rapidly. Her complexion has changed from yellow to saffron, indicating a change in her complexion. Macmann has a strong desire to take Moll in his arms, and he would have done so had she not rejected his advances. Moll has declined Macmann's advances, which he interprets as a fall off of her affection for him.
Macmann has a deep attachment to a woman named Moll. Moll is described as having boundless regret and love. Malone expressed hope that Moll would take pity on him and comfort him. However, when Moll looked at him with a look of love and regret, Malone reacted with a frenzy and began to cry and beg for mercy. Despite Malone's distress, Moll did not make any attempt to stop him from crying.
Moll lost a tooth during the daytime and Macmann was able to recover it and put it away in a safe place. Lemuel, whose name is Lemuel and his parents were probably Aryan, is in charge of Moll from now on and advises him to eat his porridge while it's boiling. Moll does not speak or smile any more. Macmann is disturbed and disturbed by Moll's situation.
Lemuel is a patient at Saint John of Gods, a private institution for the aged and infirm and a hospice for the elderly and infirmed. Lemuel is unable to provide a clear answer to questions about the nature of the institution or its purpose. Macmann, the patient, has the power to order Lemuel to be silent if he feels Lemuel has not been clear enough or hasn't made clear his intentions. When asked about the institution's private or state nature, Lemuel tends to react with nervousness and nervousness, expressing doubt or denial, and expressing hypomaniacal fits of good
Moll is inflexible when it comes to regulations and has a strong will to enforce them. BuV Lemuel is made of sterner stuff and is not a stickler for the statutes. Macmann, despite being able to smuggle oysters into the office, never saw sight or sign of the prohibited article.
Flayed MALONE DIES 269 is a character living by memory with a mind infested with cobras, unable to dream or think and powerless to prevent his suffering. Lemuel's cries are of two kinds: those of moral anguish and those of hope, similar in every respect. Physical pain seems to help Lemuel, as evidenced when he showed Macmann his shin covered with bruises, scars, and abrasions. Macmann has visited Lemuel and caused him to come to a standstill, causing Lemuel to roar and cry for help. In response to Macmann's visit, Lemuel uses a
An aeroplane passes, making a noise that sounds like thunder. This is the first time I have heard it here, but I've heard aeroplanes elsewhere and have seen them in flight, including the very first in flight and the latest models. I was present at one of the first loopings of the racecourse which was above a racecourse. My mother held me by the hand during the looping and described it as a miracle. My memory is full of steep hills and I often get confused between them.
Macmann is a market-gardener who has only one eye and wears side-whiskers. Tyler's gate is located opposite Tyler's house. Tyler and Macmann met on their way home from the butcher's. Macmann was told a funny story about his mother and the stories he was told by some one who found it funny.
A man has hit me on the head causing a strange light in my vision. I don't know what he was trying to communicate with me. He had been there for some time and had a clear view of me. I am not deaf, having witnessed an aeroplane crash and being irritable to specifically human sounds. I make no sound, yet I pant, cough, moan, and gulp MALONE DIES 271.
A man dressed in an antiquated cut, black tie, snow-white shirt, heavily Starched clown's cuffs, oily black hair, long, dismal, glabrous, floury face, sombre lacklustre eyes, medium height and build, with a block-hat pressed delicately to stomach with finger-tips, and a folding-rule, to-gether with a fin of white handkerchief, emerged from a breast pocket. The man is described as an undertaker's man who has been present for at least seven hours and possibly more. He left at about six o'
Samuel Beckett has a conversation with a character named Samuel, who is a personification of happiness. 272Samuel speaks in a monotone voice, speaking of the morning and afternoon and of such and such an hour. 272 Samuel's character has a phobia of talking about happiness and prefers not to think about it. 272 The character has hidden an exercise book under the Blanket to prevent Samusel from taking it from her.
I slipped my exercise-book out of sight when I was writing without thinking that JJU could easily have taken it. JJU took his exercise book from him during his lunch break. However, when JJU returned from his lunch, the exercise book was no longer in the place where he had seen me put it.JJU also took his umbrella, a tight-rolled rolled umbrella, which he used to raise the bed.
An umbrella was used to try and open a window, but it couldn't open due to the smell from the blankets. It was with an umbrella that I thought he was going to kill me, with its long sharp point, he only needed to plunge it in my heart. I watched him closely during the night, possibly for hours without winking. I don't know what he did while I was asleep.
Malone is a ne'er-do-well who is buried six feet under hell. Malone is known for his ease with dressing in black, manipulating his umbrella and using block-hat, and his mastery of the black umbrella. Malone was able to disguise himself for a brief moment, but only for half an hour at most. Malone wore brown boots that were copiously caked with fresh mud, suggesting he had to toil to reach me.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is trying to establish who he is and what he does for a living. He asks questions about his employer and asks for an India rubber to solve his problems. Samuel has seen a man named Samuel before and suspects he has seen him before. Samuel wants to show a page from his exercise-book and ask for the India rubber.
I had grown used to him and was thinking of him and trying to understand his presence. I did not see him vanish, but I did hear him, including the clank of his watch, the thump of his umbrella on the floor, his rapid steps towards the door, and his gay and lively whistle. Eventually, I will see him as he just has been or as he should have been for me to understand and understand him. Drivel is the first of a series of visitors who are going to relay one another.
I am in a dark hole where all the people I have ever seen or seen are likely to file past. There may be some women and children present who are armed with something to lean on and rummage in. They are most likely to give me a clout on the head and spend the rest of the day glaring at me in anger and disgust. I will have to revise my questionnaire to adapt it to all and sundry. Perhaps one of the women or children, unmindful of his instructions, will give me her stick. I might be able to catch a little girl and strangle her until she promises
A little girl would come into Malone's barrow, undress before him, sleep beside him, spend the night with him, and throw herself out of the window when they got to know she was with him. Malone would teach the little girl love and loathing and she would put a plug in his arsehole as per instructions. Malone suggests that the Lord Mayor of Cork lasted for ages, but he was young, had political eonvictions, human convictions, and allowed himself a sip of water from time to time. Malone is suffering from a severe migraine caused by an in-candescent migraine and
Macmann pygmy is in a place where the air is smoldering and there is a sense of shame. Macmann Pygmy beneath the g'cat black gesticulating pines gazes at the distant raging sea. The others are also present but unable to do anything to help Macmann, clinging to pop-lars or shivering in the cold. The air is choking Macmann's lungs and he feels a little lacking in oxygen.
Macmann is deaf and has been deaf to wind, sea, paper, and air for a long time. Macmann has a chi'd's exercise-book, which has been a significant part of his daily routine and life-long companion. Macman wants to put down in the exercise book for the last time to express his distress to those he has called to, especially those who are ill, so that they may cease with him and he can rest.Macmann has taken the air in all weathers, from morning to night, and more than once the keepers had to go out with lanterns to
Macmann has always hidden in the same place and has always been in the exact same place. Lemuel went out alone to the bush in which Macmann has made his lair and waited for him there. Macmann and Lemuel would wait in the bush for some time before going into the lair, listening to the noises of the night, the owls, the wind in the leaves, the sea, and other night sounds. Sometimes Macmann would get tired of being alone and go back to his cell and stay there until Lemuel rejoined him.
Macmann took a stick from Lemuel and began striking him with it. Lemuel told Macmann to stop and called a keeper by the name of Pat. Pat snatched the stick from Macmann. Macmann was reprimanded and threatened by Lemuel, who threatened to hand him over to Jack. Jack is described as a more powerful keeper and has a powerful personality. Later, Macmann returned from his walk with a hyacinth that he had torn up in order to hide in it.
No questions were ever asked in the House of Sain John of God and stern measures were taken according to the dictates of a peculiar logic. 278 SAMUEL BECKETT asks questions about the nature of justice and the concept of "flowers in the hand". 278 Samuel Beckett suggests that the mere fact of holding something for all to see is a crime similar to that of the receiver or fence. 278 Samuel Beckett believes that it would have been better to make the guilty information known to all concerned so that a sense of guilt would accompany the guilty act, similar to a guilty act itself. 278 Samuel
Sapo and the birds, Moll, the peasants, and those who live in towns seek one another out and fly from one another. Birds, such as crows and starlings, set off in flocks for distant pastures and returned the same evening joyous to the sanctuary. The air was filled with their voices, especially at dawn and dusk. The gulls were many in stormy weather, landing in grass or on house-to-s during their flight inland. Sapo's doubts, his situation, his possessions, and his abandonment are just pretexts for his abandonment.
The setting is a plateau with gentle slopes and is occupied by Saint John, a domain of Saint John. There is a high wall that surrounds the plateau and a summit called the Rock due to the rock on it. From the Rock, a fine view can be obtained of the plain, the sea, mountains, the smoke of the town and the buildings of the institution. Moll had not lied, the plateau is a great mound and the entire top is Saint John's domain.
Macmann describes his surroundings as a "little Paradise for those who like their nature sloven." Macmann has the right to be abroad in all weathers, food and lodging free of charge, a minimum of persecution and corporal punishment, superb views, trees and bushes with outstretched branches, no human contact except with Lemuel, a solitary existence, and the presence of Moll, his lifelong enemy. Moll is now dead and Macmann finds the situation less pleasant than he thought. Macmann is walking towards the wall but not too close for it to be guarded.
Samuel Beckett expresses his feeling of having had enough without pausing to reflect or consider his feelings. 280 SAMUEL BECKETTS is depicted as artless and has no capacity for introspection or introspection. 280 Samuel Beckett has a deep affection for a certain type of thing, which he refers to as excessive and honoured by a variety of names. 280 Samu Beckett expressed his feelings by saying "I have had enough" without considering what he had lost and what he would have enough of when he got it back. 280 The thing Samuel has had enough of is expressed in an artless
Macmann is trapped in space, surrounded by other things such as a child- ren, lodges, the gates, and the Lodges. Macmann is unable to understand what is happening around him due to the presence of other things, such as the child-ren. The space is a chaotic conflux of oozings and torrents, with the trapped things changing and dying according to their solitude. A keeper came out of one of the lodges with a key, a long black object, and a group of children lined up along the drive. The key was used to open the heavy gates of the Lod
Macmann and others in the park often stray from morning to night, often in rare glades and among trees that hide the sky and high ferns. Macmann carries a daguerreotype of a woman standing beside a chair with long plaits and a trellis with clambering flowers. Moll gave the photograph to Macmann when she was 14 years old and gave it to him on her birthday. She remembered the day, a summer day, when they took her to see Punch and Judy.
Macmann liked a picture of a chair made of straw with roses and roses in it. Lemuel, a member of the group Lemuel and Lady Pedal, was planning an excursion to the islands and was planning to leave for one day, leaving one p.m. W’on it rained, when it snowed, and Lemuel found a notice pinned on the board about him in the great hall before setting out on his rounds. Lemeul was not liked and initiated the notice and went away, causing Lemuel's colleagues to observe and poke fun at him.
Lady Pedal organized an outing to the islands for the benefit of Lemuel’s group. Lady Pedal lives for doing good and bringing happiness into the lives of those less fortunate than her. Lemuel has a room on the fourth or fifth floor where he could have thrown himself out of the window if he had been less weak-minded. The room is small and empty, with bare boards for sleeping and eating, and a long silver carpet running across the calm repouss<5 sea.
Lady Pedal is one of the inmates of Saint John of God’s, also known pleasantly locally as the Johnny Goddams or the Goddam Johnnies. Lady Pedal treats the inmates once every two years to excursions by land and sea through scenery renowned for its beauty or grandeur and entertainments on the premises such as whole evenings of prestidigitation and ventriloquism on the terrace. She is often accompanied by other ladies who share her lifestyle and means of thinking. Lemuel is in the kitchen preparing six excursion soups.
Lemuel consumes six pieces of bacon, including his own and five others, and eats all the fat off them, including the rinds. Lemuel believes that they should have issued six extra or excursion soups at his request. The cells of five individuals are far apart and astutely disposed, allowing Lemuel to visit them in turn. In the first cell, Lemuel finds a young man, dead young, seated in an old rocking chair, who would have seemed asleep had his eyes not been open. The young man never went out unless commanded to do so and always had to be accompanied by
SAMUEL BECKETT, also known as the Saxon, is in a cell four or five hundred paces distant from the first cell. SAMUEL is described as having a stodgy stature, stiffness, and an air of perpetually looking for something and wondering what that something could possibly be. SamUel has a strong foreign accent and is referred to as a "Saxon" by Lemuel. Samuel has two hands to carry two buckets of soup, a significant change from the single hand he had been carrying before. He has swathed himself in two blankets and a rough and ready cocoon,
Lemuel dreams about a man named Quin who has a habit of going out from time to time into the air and returning to his cell. In the third dream, a small thin man pacing up and down, his cloak folded over his arm, and an umbrella in his hand, Quin was asking questions in a low voice, reflecting, replying, and scratching his self. The fourth dream involves a misshapen giant, bearded, who spends his days ranging about the park in all directions and loves the gloom and secrecy of the ferns, but he never seeks them out.
Macmann is a character who subsists and has not come back for a long time. Macmann remembers the youth, the Saxon, the thin one, and the giant, but she doesn't remember their names and doesn't know if they have changed or if they are still present. MacMannon is experiencing grandiose suffering due to a phenomenon similar to a mirage in the desert and a noise similar to rushing water, which she describes as a phenomenon mutatis mutandis. She believes she is being given birth to into death and believes her head will be the last to Cue.
Lemuel has assembled a flock of five characters including Macmann, a youth, a giant, the thin one, the Saxon, a Saxon and a young Saxon. 286 SAMUEL BECKETT is the director or his delegate, also present, and he is a member of the group.
Lemuel, Macmann, the Saxon, the giant, the youth, the thin one, and the two colossi dresseU in sailor-suits are in a waggonette. Lady Pedal is a huge, big, tall, fat woman with a heavily spotted fall-veil, artificial daisies with brilliant yellow disks, and a broad-brimmed straw hat. They are alone on a great terrace on a cloudless, still skyless day. The director suggests that Lady Pedel might have telephoned for help due to a change of the weather.
Lady Pedal is a character who has a waggonette and a giant character named Lemuel. Lady Pedal and Lemuel are at the bottom of a hill and are about to meet each other. Lemuel is a sailor who is not in charge of the ship. LadyPedal has a spirit of joy and encourages her guests to make the most of this glorious day.
Lemuel and two other sailors named Ernest and Swell are having a jaunt in a boat with four oars, four rowlocks, stern-sheets, and a boat-like structure. The boat has room for twice as many oars as a waggonette and can be used for multiple oars at a pinch. Lemuel has a hatchet and uses his heel for safety. Lady Pedal can smell the sea, indicating that she can sense it. The oars steer the boat with no rudder and there is no sound save the oars and the blue sea against the keel.
Lemuel and Lady Pedal are on an island, an islet with a narrow, jagged shoreline facing the open sea. The island is made up of two islands separated by a gulf and two reefs. Lemuel is a giant and a Saxon and refuses to leave the boat, which leaves him and Macmann unable to leave it. The land on the island is jagged with creeks and deep water comes from deep walls of rock. The slopes of the island are covered with ling and furze, better known as gorse, and the hammers of stone-cutters are heard
Lemuel killed Mac-Mann with a hatchet. Maurice was sitting on a stone filling his pipe when Lemuel killed him. Ernest came back to meet Lemuel and kill him in the same way as the other two men. Lady Pedal called for all of them to join her in hunting for Druid remains.Lady Pedal fainted at the sight of the late sailors.
Macmann and two others, presumably Lemuel and Macmann, got into a boat and set out from the shore. Lemuel has shipped his oars, leaving a trail in the water. Macmann and the others are far out in the bay, far away from shore. The night is strewn with absurd lights, stars, beacons, buoys, lights of earth and faint fires of the blazing gorsc.
Lemuel Lemuel is in charge and has the ability to use any weapon, whether it's a hatchet, a hammer, a stick, a pen, a pencil, a light light, a fist, or in thought in dream. Lemuel has the power to change his mind and is capable of questioning his existence, which he uses to create a sense of uncertainty and uncertainty. Part III of "The UNNAMABLE" begins with Lemuel asking questions, hypotheses, and questions about his existence. He suggests that one day, instead of going out, he decided to stay in and spend the day and
Samuel Beckett is in a situation where he is unsure how to proceed. Samuel believes that his actions must be validated or validated by affirmations and negations. Samuel does not understand the concept of aporia and believes it can be ephectic without knowing what it actually means. Samuel intends to "shit on all" his actions. Samuel is aware that he will have to speak of things he can't speak, which he finds interesting. Samuel promises never to be silent in the beginning, despite being alone.
The question is whether one can adopt a positive attitude towards things and if they are necessary. I have few illusions about the inevitability of things and believe it's best not to make any decisions in advance. I don't see how I can avoid the spirit of system, whether it is people with things, people without things, or things with-out people. I do not intend to be a person- ally to Malone, who passes before me at regular intervals and I see nothing further to be hoped from him.
I am watching a man who passes close by me, a few feet away, always in the same direction. I see him from the waist up, stopping at the waist, and his trunk is erect. He is wearing a brimless hat. I believe he is wearing Malone's hat. Molloy's hat is the only thing I can see of him, he has no other clothes. I have only seen him from a distance and do not know whether he is on his feet or on his knees. The setting is vast and dim with intermittent lights suggesting a kind of distance.
I am in a place where others have been for a long time and believe there are other places set aside for us and this one is merely their narthex. I have always been sitting at the selfsame spot, at the spot where Malone has passed before me, and I have no opinion on when Malone will pass before me again. Malone's beard hangs down, either side of his chin in two twists of unequal length. I feel a sense of pity for Malone and his beard. I cry from time to time, but believe it is nothing saddening.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has been in this place for 296 years and has been there ever since he began to be, his appearances elsewhere having been put in by other parties. 296 Samuel has been troubled by one or two manifestations, which he is unable to understand. 296 Samson believes that nothing has ever changed since he has been here and that nothing ever will change. 296 Samuel believes that he owes his existence to no one and that his existence owes nothing to any one, including his own thoughts and feelings. 296 Samantha creates obscurities in his thoughts, such as notions of forbears, houses where
The play of the lights in the room is unpredictable and unpredictable. Malone appears and disappears with the same speed and velocity, always at the same distance, in the same direction, and always the same attitude. The lights can shine strong one minute and weak the next, but never beyond the power of one or two candles. Malone's appearance and movement are constant and unwavering and fixed, but they can sometimes change in unpredictable ways. Malone is relying on the lights as well as other similar sources of credible perplexity to help him continue and perhaps even conclude the conversation.
I have been in a place for a long time and nothing has changed since I have been there. The place may be vast and may measure up to twelve feet in diameter. I like to think that I would be better off at the centre of the place rather than at the circumference, since my eyes are always fixed in the same direction. Molloy, who I perceive as a wheel, passes before me in a straight line. If he made a noise, I would hear him all the time, on my right hand, behind my back, and on my left hand before seeing him again.
SAMUEL BECKETT believes he is not deaf and is half-convinced that he is in perpetual motion, accompanied by Malone. SAMUEL believes that the disorder of the lights is due to his insistence on viewing them as always the same lights and viewed always from the same point. SamUEL considers himself fixed and at the centre of this place and finds it pleasing and pleasing to think of himself as being fixed and in the center of the place. Samuel has been in this place for a long time and has experienced no change apparently since he has been there, with only a sense of une
It is possible for me to think of myself as being here forever but not being there forever. Lucifer is a distant analogy to consider myself as having been here forever. Memory, which I did not think I was entitled to draw upon, has the capacity to give me a thousand words if necessary. After a long period of immaculate silence, a feeble cry was heard by me. I do not know if Malone heard the cry, but I was surprised by it. There are no human creatures in this place and it's impossible to identify them.
The UNNAMABLE 299 considers the possibility of having seen Halley's comet. 299 She believes that her beginnings coincide with that of the place she lives in and that the place was made for her and she for it at the same instant. 299 When two shapes, oblong like man, entered into collision before her, they fell and she saw them no more. 299 1 thought of the pseudocouple Mercier-Camier and decided to give a companion to Malone. 299 299 The conversation is about a man who may die at the age of seventy without seeing Halley’s comet.
Malaysia is depicted as darkly as the first time I saw her. My eyes are fixed always in the same direction and I can only see what appears immediately in front of me. I have no control over my eyesight and can only focus on what appears close beside her. I can see the collision, followed by the fall and disap- pearance of Malone and the approach of their approach. The visibility of the scene permits me to see only what is close beside me. My seat is elevated due to the surrounding ground due to water or some other liquid.
SamuEL BECKETT believes that he owes his knowledge about men to the delegates who told him things about men which he initially refused to believe. Samuel believes that from these men, he has learned what he knows about men and their ways of putting up with it. SamuEL has never been in contact with these gentlemen, but he believes it can only have been from them that he learned this information. 300 SAMUEL owes this information to these men who gave him the low-down on God and told him that he depended on him for his reliance on the reliable authority of his agents at Bally
They gave me courses on love, intelligence, most precious, precious, and most precious. They taught me to count, and even to reason. They were most determined for me to swallow the concept of my fellow-creatures. I remember little or nothing from these lectures, but I seem to have retained certain descriptions in spite of myself. Some of this knowledge has come in handy on occasions which would not have arisen if they had left me in peace. There were four or five of them presenting their report to me, one of whom, Basil, filled me with hatred and changed me into what he wanted me to be.
I am in a position of safety and amusement, wondering who could have dealt me insignificant wounds. Another character emerges from heavy hangings, who is stooping and seems to be dragging invisible burdens. His hat is worn and worn through, revealing a straggle of grey hairs. He is wearing a hat with a crown that is worn through like the sole of an old boot and has a worn crown that reveals his grey hairs and a few grey hairs in his eyes. He has a long, imploring gaze, suggesting he wants me to do something for him. He regularly visits but his visits have never coincided with the transit
The interval between appearances of Malone and another person is erratic, with varying velocities and speeds. I have only had an encounter with Malone a long time ago, which seems to have been the end of a significant event. I believe that I might have the good fortune to see both Malone and the other person at the same time, possibly even collide and knock each other down. Unfortunately, the other people who disturb my peace are not the only ones disturbing my peace, others come towards me, pass before me, wheel about me, and disturb the peace.
Samuel begins a discourse without thinking about how to stop things and starts speaking without considering how to end them. Samuels believes that the search for the means to put an end to things, an end of speech, is what enables the discourse to continue. Samuel believes that he will have to banish entities, things, shapes, sounds, lights, and creatures from his current place. Samuel is concerned with truth in the frenzy of utterance. Samuel considers a possible deliverance by means of encounter, but he believes he will eventually have to confront himself through a god named Malone. Samuel sees Malone as a stranger
The air around me is grey, dimly transparent, and has a charmed circle around it, which deepens and spreads its fine impenetrable veils. There is no night so deep that it can't be pierced with the help of the blackened sky or the earth. The grey, first murky, then opaque air surrounding me is luminous and denser than the surrounding air. I perceive this denser air to be the en-closure wall, as compact as a compact lead. I would need a stick or pole and a means of plying it to elucidate this point.
I no longer have the ability to use sticks and rely solely on my body alone. I no longer rely on Basil and his crew to rest me from seeing, prevent me from waking, to darken me to sleep, and prevent me dreaming. My eyes are as red as live coals 99% of the time and I often wonder if the two retinae are facing each other. I remember the plumage of certain birds, among which I seem to remember the cockatoo. I believe that grey is shot with rose and made of bright and black.
Matthew identifies himself as an angel who came before the cross, before the sinning, and came into the world. Matthew has the ability to think but not to speak. Matthew adds this to his statement to be on the safe side. Matthew is uncertain about the future of the things he says and intends to say. Matthew believes that he has never been elsewhere and has no idea where he will be.
Samuel is under a compulsion to think about the past and to speak about the future. Samuel believes that what he says and what he intends to say relates to the place where he is and to the person who is there. Samuels believes that he is not heading for disaster and that his adventures are over. However, he is anxious about the prospect of putting an end to both his past and his present adventures. Samuel feels an obligation to start again, to start from nowhere and start again from nowhere.
The character is facing an imminent execution and expresses hope that one day she will be able to go silent and make an end to her life. Despite her physical and mental handicaps, the character believes that she will eventually know something about the place she is in, which she describes as the same place as always. The character expresses a desire to end her life, but is afraid of going on. She believes that to go on means finding her, losing her, vanishing and beginning again.
The UNNAMABLE 305 is fixed, lost for tininess or straining against the walls, listening to old stories and listening to them as if it were the first time. She is afraid of what her words will do to her refuge, her old stories. She has a hope that if she could speak and say nothing, she might escape being gnawed to death by an old satiated rat and her little tester-bed along with her. However, despite her fear, the 305 does not despair and does not lose hope of not losing her, of not going from here, of ending here.
Prometheus is a miscreant who has offended many gods, invented fire, created fire, denatured clay, domesticated the horse, mocked humanity, and mocked humanity. Prometheus has been delivered to the world twenty-nine hundred and seventy years after having purged his offence. There is nothing in common between Prometheus and me. Prometheus made me waste his time, suffer for nothing, and speak of others when he should have spoken of himself and of this place alone. I have spoicen of me and am speaking of me for the first time.
I have used 306 SAMUEL BECKETT and lent them pains and memories for their use. I have created a void where there is no one and no one has ever met anyone before. There is no light in the void, no sounds, and the lights have gone out with the void. I know nothing about the black void, only me and this void.
I know my eyes are open because of the tears that pour from them. I know I am seated, my hands are on my knees, and I feel pressure against my rump, soles of my feet, against my palms, and against my knees. I don't know what the pressure is against my spine, but I know it's not sup- ported. I feel my back straight, my neck stiff and free of twist, and the head is straight, like the ball of a cup-and-ball in its cup at the end of a stick. The tears flow freely across my face and down
The UNNAMABLB 307 is a character who sees nothing and is in a plane. If she is clothed, she often asks herself questions about Malone's hat, Molloy's greatcoat, or Murphy's suit. UNNABLB 307 feels her tears coursing over her chest, sides, and down her back, indicating that she is bathed in teaii. The tears gather in her beard and gather into a smooth ball that she carries on her shoulders. The character has no beard, no hair, and features that are featureless except for the eyes, which are only the sockets. UN
The conversation takes place in a place where things have fallen without leaving a trace, leaving a deep hole. Organs, hair, eyes, and ears have fallen and are still falling, leaving no trace. The speaker has invented love, music, the smell of a flowering currant, and the concept of a flower. She believes she is a big talking ball, capable of talking about things that do not exist or that are impossible to know.
SAMUEL BECKETT is of an irregular shape and subject to the dents and bulges caused by shock. 308 SAMUEL ELIZABETT renounces the concept of light and dark. 308 SamuEL is interested in whether he rolls in the manner of a true ball, or if he is in equilibrium on one of his numberless poles. 308 Samuel BecketT is aware of the potential for discourse from this topic, but he believes it would not be credited to him. 308
I am a person who speaks a lot and seeks a lesson. I have been through a difficult period in my own life, with a few nice people trying to foist their groans on me and the distant glimmers of pity’s fires biding their time to promote us to ashes. I consider saying what I should not have said, what I shall say no more, and what I might say if I can say more. I will continue seeking my lesson, possibly to self-accompaniment of a tongue that is not mine.
I feel nothing and have no feelings that can serve as a starting point towards forming an opinion on a subject. I do not possess any general notions or use of reason. I know nothing and know nothing in terms of thinking, but I do enough to preserve myself from going silent. The voice that speaks is indifferent to what it says, knowing it lies, indifferent to its own uselessness, and too old and abased to succeed in saying the words that would be its last. I can't stop the voice from speaking and know it is not mine.
I have no voice and must speak because I have to revolve around a voice that is not mine. I have no idea who the voice belongs to, but it can only be mine. There is no one else who has ever come near me and I have never spoken to anyone else. I know that I must speak to prevent the discourse from ending and to prevent a futile dis- course which is not credited to me. I think I know what the voice is and I think it is to prevent this discourse from stopping. I am speechless and afraid of what would happen if I went silent.
SAMUEL BECKETT is depicted as a character in a fairy-tale and has the ability to create new fairy-tales and has done so in the past while unfolding his facetiae. 310 SAMUEL has created a certain number of highly promising formulae which he promised himself to turn to good account after he has finished with his troop of lunatics. 310 Samuel believes that it is difficult to focus one's attention on another point, where one's true interest lies. 310 Samuel has heard a murmur telling of another and unpleasant method of ending his troubles.
The conversation takes place in a place where I am in a state of being dead and engaged in making a noise in obedience to the un- intelligiole terms of an incomprehensible damnation. I have spent time and effort trying to create utterances that would make up for the utterances I have made in the past, but all is forgotten and I have done nothing until it gives me greater satisfaction. I find myself floundering through a pon- derous chronicle of moribunds in their courses, moving, clashing, writhing, or falling in short-lived swoons. I was impressed
Mahood, also known as Basil, is a character in the story. Mahood has the ability to go silent for long periods of time. He has a history of sharing stories about himself with other characters and has told stories to others about himself. Basil has a strong preference for the sea and considers it to be the only thing that matters.
Mahood has been a part of my life for a long time. Mahood's voice has often mingled with mine and sometimes drowned it completely. When Mahood was away, I tried to forget what he had said about me, about my misfortunes and idiotic pains, but his voice continued to testify for me, as though woven into mine, preventing me from saying who I was, what I was and what I did. Despite Mahood no longer plagues me, his voice is there but less, less, and I hope it will disappear from my life one day. SAMUEL B
The conversation takes place in a setting where the agent is the one who tells the story. The agent does not have a voice, not even in part. The story begins quietly, stealthily, as if nothing had happened. During the conversation, the agent would be fast asleep, her mouth agape, her eyes agape and she would look the same as usual. Lies would pour from the agent's mouth and from her mouth the lies would pour about her. Sometimes the agent was in tears, sometimes she would think she was doing her best, and sometimes she felt she was trying her best but was failing. Eventually,
I was given a pensum at birth as a punishment for being disliked by those who dislike me. I don't remember the nature of the pensum and I have forgotten what it is. The pensum was given to me by a person who has never spoken to me and has never listened to me. However, I have spoken for my master and listened for the words of my master. I have been told by my master to speak for his master and listen for his words. There is a college of tyrants, differing in their views on what should be done with me, who have been in conclave since time began
If I have a pensum to perform, it is because I could not say my lesson. Once I have finished my pensum, I will have to reconstitute the right lesson. I have to perform a penitential before I have the right to stay quiet in a corner, with my mouth shut, my tongue at rest, my mind at peace, and my mind empty. I find the idea of a task to be performed before one can be at rest a strange notion and open to suspicion. Possessed of nothing but my voice, the voice, it may seem natural to interpret it as an obligation
Mahood is portrayed as a character named Carmagnole who has a master named 314 SAMUEL BECKETT. Mahood is described as a being whose identity is usurped and whose voice is prevented from being heard. Carmagnol is involved in stories of a being named Mahood, whose identity has been usurped, and whose stories are all lies, all lies from beginning to end, and all stories of which he prevents the identity of the being Mahood and the stories of Mahood's identity being heard, all stories in which he has usurped the identity and voice of the character Mahood.
The conversation takes place in a setting where a rich matter is to be exploited, fattened up and fed to keep you going for a long time. There is a character named Moran who is described as a satrap or master. Moran's boss is referred to as Q. Q has provided clothing and money to the character, providing him with a light touch. However, the character has never paid much attention to Q. The character mentions a few allusions to Q, other characters with a view to enlisting sympathy, but eventually decides not to investigate the matter seriously.
My master is described as a solitary, in my image, who wishes me well and wishes my good. My master has been accustomed to giving orders and being obeyed, possibly since I came into the world, possibly at his instigation. If the master doesn't do very much in order not to be dis- appointed, it could be because there is nothing to be done. Cases one and two suggest that the master has a protege or other proteges who have taken care of me without consulting him. The UNNAMABLE master could have been commanding me tosolitary.
A conversation with a man who keeps dining at me and is unhappy. I want to try to cheer him up, but there is no conversation between us and he has never spoken to me. I suspect that the man is unhappy because he didn't choose me. The man is capable of wanting me to be happy or to serve a purpose or both at once. I would like to know what he wants from me, but it's none of my business to ask him questions and let him explain.
I believe that there is a supreme being who seeks my good and seeks to bring him to a more reasonable frame of mind. I ask him to enlighten me in order to understand what sense I leave to be desired. I believe he is not solitary like me and is associated with others who are equally good, equally concerned with my welfare, but differing in their nature. If the supreme being wants me to do something for his good, he has only to tell me what it is and I will let it out with a roar. He has already told me what he wants a hundred times.
The 316 SAMUEL BECKETT believes that continuing to be what he has always been would be better than a lame resolution. He has been unhappy and feels abandoned by those around him. Mahood has left him and he feels alone. Samuel Beckett suggests that they should wash their hands of him and set him free to make him feel better. He invented words to say, a truth to recover, and an imposed task to perform to fulfil.
I have nothing to do and have nothing in particular to say, but I feel compelled to speak because I have the ocean to drink and an ocean of words to say. I feel a sense of Labyrinthine torment that can't be grasped, limited, or felt. I suffer all wrong and feel like an old turkey-hen dying on her feet, covered with chickens, rats, and chickens. I hear myself howling behind my dissertation.
Mahood's stories are foreign to me and familiar to an unfamiliar native land of mine. Mahood is not the first person to tell these stories. Before him, there were others who took themselves for me, a tradition handed down from generation to generation, according to their family air. The current vice-exister is no worse than his predecessors and is to be executed as a billy in the bowl, with his bowl on his head and his arse in the dust.
Mahood has been in places he claims to have been instead of staying in his domain. 318 SAMUEL BECKETT is confronted by Mahood in a domain where he is supposed to be. 318 Mahood has told Samuel about what he is like, what she looks like, and what she is like. 318 Samuels believes that Mahood will eventually admit his presence in her domain and explain how he got there. 318 Samuel Beckett is short of a leg due to a prognynme that has brought her to death's door due to senile gangrene. 318 Sammy Beckett has
Mahood, a character in the story, has treated me in a way that made me mistake him for another man. Mahood has nearly coddled me more than once, causing me to mistake him. I often dreamt of becoming a man and had hopes of becoming one in the future. I imagine myself among the incriminated scenes, under attributes peculiar to the lords of creation, dumb with howling and unable to escape. I hear the spinach blue rustling with satisfaction and the sound of champagne being uncorked, suggesting that one of us emerges from the scene.
After each thrust of her crutches, I consume a narcotic to measure distance and measure distance. I had advanced a good ten paces and was moving in a sharp curve, which seemed likely to restore me to my point of departure or to an adjacent point. I got embroiled in an inverted spiral, a kind of inverted spiral where the coils of which grew narrower and narrower The UNNAMABLE 319.
I found myself stuck in a room, unable to go any further. If I had chosen to set off again in the opposite direction, I would have had to screw myself to a standstill. I had been told that the road is dull on the way out but dull on its way back. I have a lot of useless knowledge and consider myself a mine of useless information. If by winding myself up, if I venture into an ellipse, I don't gain much time, and I inevitably find myself stuck.
Mahood is at the end of a world tour, possibly with more than two or three centum percent to go. Mahood has left his leg behind in the Pacific and is currently somewhere off the coast of Java, possibly off the Indian Ocean, possibly in the Java jungle.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has returned to the fold after a long journey and is returning to his family, including his wife, parents, and children who were born in his absence.SAMUEL has found himself in a vast yard or campus surrounded by high walls and a small rotunda in a rotunda, windowless, but well furnished, rotunda with loopholes. Samuel has been away from home for a long time and has been expecting his loved ones to be waiting for him. Samuel believes that the rotunda is a nest where his absent loved ones are waiting for his return.
The period of Ptomaine has changed significantly since Mahood's arrival. The children have increased in stature, the ages have changed, and the ancients have shown less interest in life and more interest in discussing it since his arrival. According to Mahood, the group of ancients he was trying to reach died due to a sausage-poisoning incident where they all died first.
Mahood has been absent for a year and a half. Mahood has a history of relating his life history to sleepy children in a bedtime story atmosphere. His parents agreed that he was a fine baby from the first fortnight or three weeks of his life. His missing leg didn't seem to affect his family when he left.
The narrators themselves, Ptoto and her wife, are part of a group of narrators who are discussing 322 SAMUEL BECKETT. Ptoto, the wife, announces the latest news to the audience, which cheers them up and brings them to bed with her. The narrators have been drawing near the end of 322SAMUEL BUETT for a long time and were anxious about the possibility of losing ground, but Ptoto reassures them that I have moved and there is no further proof of my progress. They kissed and wished each other happy dreams before retiring.
Malone was in a situation where a person was having trouble and was being held back due to it. Malone explains that the situation was ill-selected to give him a shock. Malone was absorbed in the business on hand and was not concerned about the nature of the business or its nature. Malone describes his feelings at this period as intense and intense interest in the task at hand. Malone compares his situation to an old broken-down cart or bat-horse unable to receive information from instinct or observation.
Mahood is a character who has a habitation and a close-knit group of near and dear ones. Mahood is well-supplied with pain-killers and has not consumed a lethal dose that would have cut short his functions. He is close to his goal and is determined to do his utmost in order to reach it. He has no time to dwell on his past and only cares about his current task to go on and get on. His only care has been to obey the figure assigned to him and he has never stopped in obedience to that figure. He often uses his halts to rub himself with Elliman
Sutik is a character who is weak in the head and has only one leg due to lack of exercise or overuse of exercise. Sutik has thrown away her crutches and collapsed in order to minister to herself in peace and comfort. According to Sutik, they were correct in saying that she had fallen, and she has also fallen voluntarily, indicating that she is an old warrior like Sutik. "I stopped, taking anodynes, waiting for the pain to abate, and panting to be on my way again."
Mahood suggested to me that I was missing a leg and an arm. Mahood revealed that he has a crutch with a homologous crutch and can use it to move 324 SAMUEL BECKETT using his unique foot to kick the end of the crutch forward. Due to the misfortune experienced by my family, which included the smell of their corpses and the noise of their agony, I stopped going along with Mahood.
I have a family that has no part or share in what I was doing. My family could have moved to other quarters during my absence and settled down a hundred leagues away without me deviating from my course. I feel a sense of longing to have floundered briefly in the great life torrent streaming from the earliest protozoa to the latest humans. I have heard screams of pain and wafts of decomposition, which would have seemed natural to me.
Mahood lied to me to obtain my adhesion for fear of paining me. According to Mahood, the bacillus botulinus is responsible for the extermination of my entire family, which is something I can admit to, but only on the condition that my personal behaviour is not affected by it. Mahood believes that he is there to be pained and not to exist, implying that he can only be moderately or finitely pained.Mahood has been killed off with the friendly remark that he has reached the end of his endurance, implying he had no choice but to disappear.
Mahood is upset at having been expelled from the world of the Bargain by a pack of blood relations and two cunts. Mahood's story involves two separate events, one of which ejected him into the infundibuliform world and the other in which he tried to take revenge. The events involved the expulsion of Mahood and the attempt to take his revenge. It has been a long time since Mahood last knew what he was talking about and his thoughts have been elsewhere, which is why he forgives Mahood for his actions.
SamuEL Becket caused a physiological reaction that led to a desire to vomit and a stench that compelled him to retreat under the threat of losing consciousness. Samuel BECKETT's actions were incompatible with the kind of creature I might have been if they had known how to take me. Eventually, SamuEL found himself within a circular building with a single room flush with the arena where he completed his rounds and found the unrecognisable remains of his family including a face, stomach, and an unrecognisable body.
Isolde's entrails is the place where I spent the last days of my long voyage and set out on the next one. Isolde could have been any breast, papa's private parts, or the heart of one of the little bastards, and I would have spent the same amount of time in any of these places. I was never anywhere else but here, and no one has ever managed to get me out of this place. He is an infant who has been told so often how he was found under a cabbage that he remembers the exact spot in the garden and the kind of life
The language I use comes from The UNNAMABLE 327, a language that prevents me from expressing who I am, where I am and doing what I have to do. I have been crammed full of this language and feel compelled to testify to them, even if it means speaking in their language. I fear being branded as belonging to their breed, which is what they imagine they will have me reduced to.
Mahood has been glutted with stories and stories and is unable to understand them. Mahood has a genius for forgetting and the ability to absorb, which he credits to his inability to absorb and his genius for remembering. He believes that it is thanks to his genius that he will be able to be himself in the end. He has decided to confront those who have glutted him with lira and to scatter them and their miscreated puppets in order to find traces of himself. He is aware that they haven't been pestering him for some time and suggests that they have inflicted the notion of time on him
Samuel Beckett believes that he is not dangerous and that he has nothing to fear. 328 SAMUEL BECKETT hasn't heard from them lately, which makes him suspect that they have abandoned him. 328 Samuel Beckett has been "blown up" by their voices. 328 Samantha Becketts believes that none will ever know what he is and that no one will ever hear him express his true self because he has no language but their language.328 Samuel BecketT believes he has been walled around by these voices and is unable to express histrue self.328 Samuel Beckett thinks he
I have been taught by someone to do whatever they instruct me to do, with a will to do it with a good grace until time is done. I am neither Murphy, nor Watt, nor Mercier, nor any of the others whose names I can't remember. I have never desired, sought, sought for, suffered, or sought for anything, and I never knew what it was to have, things, adver- saries, mind, senses. I know how to speak in the way they intend me to speak, and it's easy for me to repeat the same old thing I know so well
Mahood has written a story called THE UNNAMABLE 329. The story is about a character named If who intends to narrate another of Mahood's stories to heighten his disgust. If believes he is on an island and has never left it. If was under the impression he spent his life in spirals around the earth. If is planning to present himself as if he was telling the story willingly.
I travel inland and take a course that involves a series of irregular loops, sharp and short, with a parabolic sweep, and unpredictable in direction depending on the panic of the moment. I do not move and never again will, unless under the impulsion of a third party. I remember being a great traveller who travelled on hands and knees, crawling on her belly or rolling on the ground, leaving only a trunk and a head. The trunk and the head are the parts of myself which I have best assimilated and retained. If I turn, I can see a statue of the apostle of horse’s
The police tolerate 330 SAMUEL BECKETT because they know he is speechless and capable of taking unfair advantage of his situation to stir up the population against its governors, whether through burning oratory during rush hour or whispering subversive slogans after night-fall. Since he has lost all his members, with the exception of a one-time virile, the police know he will not be guilty of any gestures that could be construed as inciting to alms, a prisonable offence. SamuEL BecketT believes that the spot chosen by the police is well chosen and suggests that even those who are disturbed
My face is depicted as one enjoying a well-earned rest. My mouth is hidden most of the time and my eyes are closed. My skull is covered with pustules and bluebottles, protecting me from being an object of envy and discontent in such a neighbourhood. Once a week, I am emptied by the pro- prietress of the chop-house across the street, who performed the task punctually and without complaint. The pro-prietress has a kitchen-garden and a tarpaulin shelter under which she keeps me warm and dry.
The benefactor covered me with a tarpaulin once or twice or three times a year, which was fatal for me. However, tears began to flow when the tarp was removed and I felt gratitude towards the benefactress. The benefactor saw me as an asset for her establishment, as I constituted a kind of landmark and an advertisement for her. I felt that the benefactor had taken care of me out of goodness and not out of pure goodness. I was depicted as a pot-bellied, full-face wafer thin person, with a full face profile and full-length wafer
SAMUEL BECKETT is interested in understanding the language of a person who speaks a language similar to that of a turnip and a carrot. SAMUEL believes that he represents a lift of capital for the character and believes she would be genuinely annoyed if he were to die, which he believes would help him to live.SAMU ELIZABETT has a deep understanding of turnips and carrots and is able to distinguish between good and bad turnips, particularly Flakkee or Colmar Red turnips.
I have been given Latin lessons in pigsty Latin and have learned it through perjury. I believe that snow alone, provided it is heavy and heavy, entitles me to the tarpaulin. I have been communicating through signs and she has been reading my signs and reading of them. I would like to be shrouded more often, expressing my displeasure and frustration. I suspect that she has talked it over with her husband and was told by him that I was merely stifling, which is the reverse of the truth.
The story I am part of involves a series of events where I am left high and dry with nothing for my renewal but the life they have imputed to me. I often forget how the story goes on and forget how it's supposed to end. Perhaps the story stops abruptly at the least sign of adhesion from me, leaving me stranded and unable to recover from her misfortunes. When they see me stranded, they pick up the thread of my misfortunate events, judging me insufficiently vitalised to bring them to a successful contusion alone. However, instead of resuming me at the point where
They want to give me a taste of two or three generations. If I ever succeed in dying under my own steam, they will be in a better position to assess if I am worthy to adorn another age or to try the same one again, with the benefit of my experience.
Samuel Beckett is in a place where there is another person who will not give him quittance until they have abandoned him and restored him to himself. SamuEL BECKETT believes that the other person is waiting for him to reveal what he was and where during a long lost time. Samuel Beckett believes that he has dwindled, he has shrunk, and has the ability to disappear, similar to a shrunken head and shoulders when one is scolded. He believes he could disappear if he were to spare himself from trying to escape.
The woman who has raised me up is responsible for filling the bottom of my jar with sawdust which she changes every week when she makes my toilet. The sawdust in the jar is softer than stone but less hygienic and less clean than stone. I used to look at myself in the blue mirrors, trying to brighten them using sawdust. Now, I consider the use of sawdust as an occupation. I open and close my eyes and move my head in and out, just as I have done before. I often leave the sawdust from the jar all night to mock and mock the woman
The character has a roguish character and possesses the ability to manipulate her trunk by tossing and writhing, which allows her to change the degree of rotation required to turn her head. She can no longer move her head in arjd out due to changes in her neck. She used to be able to open and close her eyes as in the past, but now she can only move the head in one direction due to the changes in the neck. The character has lost some of her riches and probably has others hidden away, waiting to be discovered by a thief. She has a collar fixed to the mouth of
The collar, or ring, of cement is an awkward piece of equipment that makes it easier for me to have hallucinations. The hallucinations include the blue face, the blue tongue, the protrusion of the tongue, and the tumefaction of the penis. I have always been a respiratory type and have a thorax and abdomen, which are still mine. Despite having no arms, I have decided not to start manstuprat- ing again as it would be indecent and fruitless.
I am a Clydesdale and a Suffolk stallion. fluttering suggests that I might be part of a larger group of scrots. flutters suggests that he has been assassinated, suicided, and is now able to stand on his own feet. fluttered suggests that society has put him on the right road, led him by the ha id to the brink of the precipice, and brought him back to life. fl flutter suggests that through the splendours of nature, society dragged a paralytic and now there's nothing more to admire.
I am a character who has the ability to manipulate the wind, which allows me to create a scenario where I am transported to another place or event where I have a beginning, an end, and an end. If only I were alive inside, one might look forward to heart-failure, heart-attack, or infarctus, or to a nice little infarction. I am usually put out of their agony with sticks to demonstrate to the backers, and bystanders, that I had a beginning and end and to prove to the assembly that I was alive. I have the capacity to push, push
I am a tapeworm who has lost heart and feels that she has all that is required to give them satisfaction. I can no longer see myself in the calamitous street they chose for me. I feel as if I had been there before, but in a diminished form, with the eyes open to impressions and one ear and the head obedient, with a vague idea of elements to be eliminated from the setting in order for it to be empty and silent. I know that I will never see this place again, where my jar stands on a pedestal with a garland of many-coloured lanterns and
At the next appearance, if I ever appear again, all will be new and strange, but I will get used to it and begin to question how to live with their kind of life without assistance and assistance. I will start to ask myself questions, prompted by their questions, about how to succeed where I had always failed and how to please the other. I have been asking myself questions about time shifts and age, and sudden shifts of time and age.
"Two expressions, two trappings, two falsehoods are to be borne to the end before I can be let loose, alone, in the unthinkable unspeakable, where I have not ceased to be, where they will not let me be." 338 S AMU EL BECKETT feels something begun and something to go, as if there is something to be done. 338 SAMELLA feels the moment has come for her to look back, if she can, and take her bearings if she is going to continue. 338 If only she knew what she was saying, she would have changed her tune.
I have to express myself in a certain manner with warmth, ease, conviction, and the right manner, as if I were a creature and not a human being. Before I can speak, I have to first think of the creature I am and then think of myself as a creature. I have been placed under a burden to prove that I am alive by the voices. The voices dictate the content of my words, and they dictate the same old sour teachings that choke me.
I have a passion for the animal kingdom and believe in the existence of another voice who does not share this passion. I have rccci\cd no information up to date and I have no information about it. I am a prey to communications and I speak of voices, even though I know it's untrue. I know nothing about me.
I am not in a position to receive any news concerning me. I have noticed that exhortations are conveyed to me by the same channel as those used by Malone and Co. for their transports. Therefore, I believe that I might be receiving revelations of more value than I had expected. My hope of receiving such revelations has been buoyed by a moment of exceptional receptivity. I think of the galley-man, bound for the Pillars of Her- cules, who drops his sweep under cover of night and crawls towards the rising sun, unseen by the guard. However, I have stopped praying for anything
They taught SAMUEL BECKETT in the same tongue, which was the only one they taught him. 340 Pupil Mahood believes that Man is a higher mammal and a lack of memory is a factor in his lack of development and memory loss. 340 Samuel Beckett is depicted as a man with a white beard and a bab-bling beard, who is depicted sitting among the children, wearing an old black pinafore, and cringing from the *rod. 340 The language they taught Samuel Beckett was in a language he didn't know. 340 They gave him orders, prayers
Worm is a solitary creature of the same breed and creed, armed with the same prong, and is the first of his kind. Worm has not been able to speak his mind, only communicating through his murmur. He has survived others like him, including Mahood, also known as Mahood. Worm is faithful and faithful, begging to be called "Worm" despite not being able to express his thoughts. Worm doesn't like being called "Mahood".
Mahood and Worm are justified in their silence. According to Mahood, if they were both silent, it would have been impossible for them to discuss the issue. Worm is not to blame for the situation and is not responsible for it. Mahood considers the issue of liberty a consideration for Mahood to consider later.
"I am engaged in a sinister operation which involves employing fifty wretches for an operation and I am short of a fifty-first person to close the circuit." "I do not understand the purpose of the operation and do not know what it's about." "The essential is never to arrive anywhere, never to be anywhere, neither where Mahood, Worm, nor Worm is, nor where I am, and the essential is to go on squirming forever at the end of the line. I've swal- lowed three hooks and am still hungry." "It is a joy to know where one is
SAMUEL BECKETT is the main suspect in the proceedings and believes he will never be caught by any other person, even if he is caught by Worm. 342 SAMUEL believes that even if Worm is still after him, he won't be delivered from him. 342Samuel has a third line, which is for her majesty's soul, which he would have hooked her on long ago if he had known where to find her. 342 Samuel has gathered together a group of four people, but they lack the hundred and first resources, implying that they will always be short of resources. 342SAMU
Watt and Mahood are characters in the conversation. Worm has the capacity to gnaw on termites in his Punch and Judy box. Worm suggests that by trying to emulate Mahood, he might be able to achieve his goal of becoming Mahood. Mahood has the ability to note certain things, even if he does not always succeed in doing so, which is a characteristic of his governance. Worm is unable to note despite making efforts to do so in the past.
Worm and Mahood are discussing the hippophagist Ducroix and the aperitif at the same time. The setting sun casts an interminable shadow across the street creating a cenotaph-like shadow. The shadow is astraddling the gutter and the sidewalk. Worm was once free to turn her head before she was put in the collar and used to contemplate the shadow, but she has lost the freedom to contemplate it since being put into the collar. Mahood seems close to Worm as evidenced by their conversation.
The meat in the restaurant has a high reputation and people come from a distance and from great distances to enjoy it. The restaurant is located just above the railings where prospective customers can compose their meals without the risk of being run over. Marguerite is supposed to light me up, but she is late. The menu for the evening includes tripe, a winter dish, or a late autumn one, which is usually served at this time of year. Tripe is served in a dish called a "g^jjive" which is the fruit of observations accumulated over a long period of years and subjected to a
SAMUEL BECKETT is in a situation where a T>ar can shut off the sky whenever it wants. 344 SAMUEL is at an end of the RaP'iigs where he can see the sky streaming into the main of the firmament. 344 Samuel is waiting for something intelligible to take place. 344
I am a human head, recently washed and with a few hairs on top. I live in a place where hungry people are compelled by the position of the menu and are compelled to post themseiVcs. I am aware of the presence of hungry people and children who pass by my place on their way to and from their play- grounds beyond the gates. I feel a sense of anticipation and curiosity about my existence. I have no smell, yet if anyone should have a smell, it would be me.
The UNNAM ABLE 346 character considers the concept of change pregnant with possibilities and considers it a principle of change. me has declined in recent times and considers herself to be in no fit condition to receive the testimony which she considers indispensable. if T succeeds in dying and J decides to adopt the most comfortable hypothesis, she would be unable to believe she ever lived. me believes that it has happened to her many times before, without their granting her a brief sick-leave among the worms before resurrecting her. me considers it an excellent thing that she should be going downhill fast and hopes that some day some gentleman will
Mahood once knew a doctor who held that scientifically speaking the latest breath can only issue from the fundament, rather than the mouth. Mahood believes that she was mistaken in supposing that death could be considered evidence or a presumption in support of a preliminary life. She no longer has the desire to leave this world without some kind of assurance that she is there, such as a kick in the arse or a kiss, and she is willing to let two third parties remark her, there, before her eyes, to ensure her safety.
Samuels Beckett has abandoned a rich vein of narrative due to exhaustion and is considering abandoning it due to the use of first person pronouns. SAMUEL BECKETT finds himself in a place called Rue Brandon, a place he has never heard of in his island home and is unfamiliar with.SAMUEL Beckett is trying to connect his presence in Rue Brandon with the unhappy Madeleine and her great goodness. Samuels believes that Madeledine's attention to him and acknowledgment of his presence attest to his substantiality. SamUels considers the evidence against him and the potential sentence he faces
The woman is losing faith in me and is trying to put off the moment when she must confess her error by visiting me every few minutes to check if I'm still in situ. She has been lavishing attention on me for some time, a change from their earlier relations when they saw each other only once a week. The belief in God is sometimes lost after a period of intensified zeal and observance, as indicated by the jar mentioned above. I doubt that I am in the jar, but I wouldn't deny its existence. I believe that the woman loves me and that she needs me.
Mahood, the chief witness, suggested to me that a woman named "The UNNAMABLE 347" was responsible for sequestrating me. I initially thought she was a near relation, mother, sister, daughter, or even a wife, but Mahood didn't say "The UnNAMable 347". Mahood's suggestion is not preposterous and accounts for certain bizarreries which had not yet struck me at the time of its formulation. Mahood has never spoken to me, to the best of her knowledge. If I have said anything to the contrary, I was mistaken and if I say anything
Marguerite has come and gone without my noticing her. The lanterns have not been lit on the same evening as usual. The stables are silent, the railings are silent and I am half-deaf. I often find it difficult to hear the stables' muffled sounds. It is cold, it has snowed this morning, yet I don't feel the rold on my head. Marguerite might have covered me with a tarpaulin due to fear of more snow in the night.
SAMUEL BECKETT is experiencing a feeling of being completely closed and feeling nothing touching her. 348 SAMU ELBECKT has placed her concerns before her responsibilities, suggesting she has been let go. 348 Samuel believes she has left Mahood's world, the street, the chop-house, the slaughter house, the statue, the city, and the sky through railings, which she describes as a slate- pencil-like pencil. 348 Samu believes that Mahood has realised the stories of Mahood are not about her and that she is the one who has won, having tried hard to please
I have no ears, no head, no memory, and no memory. My function is to announce what is going 5n and pass on the news. I say what I am told to say in the hope that some day they will weary of talking at me. I seem to hear a voice which I believe to be Worm's voice. I have an ego and believe I have the ability to speak of it. I believe they are trying to trap me with a trap to make me believe I am an ego all my own. I don't believe they won't catch me in the end, but I wish they
Worm and another character are in the same galley. Like a mother who whistles to prevent a baby's bladder from bursting, another character in the galley has the ability to interact with others. Worm has the potential to be the anti-Mahood and is seen as an anti-Worm by Mahood and his team. Worm is not aware of himself, his senses tell him nothing about himself, and he knows nothing about the world around him. Worm exists but not for himself and only for others. Others conceive him and say he exists, as if there could be no being without being conceived.
Samuel Beckett identifies a character named Worm as the truest and most unchanging character in the story. 350SAMUEL BECKETT believes that life will dictate how he lives his life and longs to have lived while he was alive. 350Samuel suggests that if one seeks the true countenance of Worm, they will find it. 350Worm is described as a character who is not spared by the need to speak, to think, and to know where one is during the wild dream, up above, under the skies, and venturing forth at night. 350According to Samuel, Worm
Worm is a character who has no voice and has no reason. Worm has been portrayed as a character with no voice or reason. According to Worm, the voices and thoughts of the devils who beset him are not his own, but those of those he perceives as devils.
Worm and Mahood are two characters in a roleplay scenario where Worm has failed to be Mahood and has to be Worm. Mahood is a character who has the ability to understand certain things without needing explanations. Worm believes that when he becomes Worm, he will automatically become Mahood. Worm is tired of being matter, pawed and pummelled and is ready to be whatever they want. Worm suggests that if they could only begin to do what they want with him and succeed, he would give up and let go.
They are all of the same kidney and yet they don't know what they want to do with me. They describe me as dust and want to make a man out of me. If I could find a voice of my own, it would end their troubles and mine. They try to lull me with little silences to make me break them. They fear that my horror of silence will force me to break it.
J52 SAMUEL BECKETT has forgotten who Worm is, where he is, and what he's like. Mahood, Murphy, and others have spoken before, but it was clumsily done by a ventriloquist. J52 hopes to give a voice to Worm and make it his own, possibly in a moment of euphoria or confusion. According to J52, Worm is no longer he, but he is still present and capable of feeling pothing, knowing nothing, capable of wanting nothing, until the moment he hears a sound that will never Stop.
Worm has been listening to a monotonous, monotonic sound and is in a coma, hoping to regain consciousness before regaining his coma. Worm perceives himself as a kind of tenth-rate Toussaint L’Ouverturc due to the monotony of the sound he hears.

I don't yet understand how to move, either locally, in relation to myself, or bodily. My understanding is not well-oiled to cope with the pressure of a critical circumstance, such as a violent pain felt for the first time. I don't understand the concept of a n?*urc to accelerate the march of the hours and the time-abolishing joys of imper- sonal and disinterested speculation. My familiarity with lights, which are merely one example of these lights, gives me nothing in return for familiarity with them.
Samuel Beckett is a character who has the ability to scorch, causing his phlegm to shatter and sparks to spirt and dash against the walls. Samuel Beckett seems to be in a head, visible above and a little to the right, surrounded by massive bone. Samuel has a terror of being frightened by another's thoughts and a longing for safety. Samuel's voice has denatured him, causing him to feel confused and confused. Samuel often feels as if his voice is going to abandon him, but he believes it's merely a passing weakness and hopes it will teach him hope.
Worm is the name they call me by and they are trying to get me to admit that I am he whose name they are calling me by. They want to wipe him from my memory. They have brought me to a certain point where I remember what I was like before all became confused and I can become Worm again if left in peace. Worm suggests that the transmis- sion is described as "really excellent" and suggests that if only they would stop talking for nothing, it would get us somewhere.
Worm is a foul brute capable of varying his voice, tone, accent, and drivel. Worm has a habit of pretending to be a many, varying his register, his moustache, and his accent. Worm is capable of long silences during which he does not say anything. Worm seems to be alone, taking counsel with himself and preparing for a fresh flow of inanity. Worm hopes there is no one left.
Mahood is facing the same problem as the scytheman, but is not the same age. Mahood believes that if they go back as planned, they will fall forward by a fraction of a century or more. The character begins by the ear and begins to talk by the radiance of conversation, indicating they know where they are and consider their origins as a subject of conversation. Eventually, Mahood becomes familiar with the premises and starts to wonder if he can sneak out by the fundament one morning with a French breakfast, but he can't move.
SamuEL BECKETT is an unthinkable ancestor of whom nothing can be said. SamuEL has failed to be conceived and is an impenetrable age when he was an impotent being. SamUel has been weakened by their attempts to weaken him and is in need of restoration. Samuel is willing to accept their terms for peace for the sake of peace.
Mahood is aware of a conversation taking place where a head is referred to and referred to by the same person. Mahood believes that the head is referring to him because he hears the conversation and believes that things will change one day. The conversation takes place in a setting where an abscess could form on a wind-pipe or other section of a conduit, which could lead to a general infection and allow Mahood to jubilate like a normal person, knowing why and being able to carry on as a "normal person". Mahood would agree with the head's idea if he were flesh and blood,
The narration is set in a scenario where a person is suffering from a pain in the neck and flies are devouring them. The narrator suggests that the heavens could have warned the afflicted person about the dangers of the flies before they start to devour them, which would have prevented them from being devoured. The narration suggests that if the howl of the howler were to be heard by the heavens, it would have warned him before the howling began. If the heavens were aware of the dangers and could have predicted their impending doom, it suggests they could have prevented the person's impending doom.
The conversation takes place in a place where he is alone, far from all men, out of range of every voice. 5he.se is a starting-point for the conversation and is a voice that speaks to him. He believes the voice has the power to speak to him, but is unsure if the words are his.
The sound I hear is not the innocent and necessary sound of dumb things constrained to endure, but the terror-stricken babble of tTie. I have not spoken yet, but I know that what I'm hearing is severe, greedy, and perhaps more greedy than when I was playing Mahood. I can hear SAMUEL BECKETT through one ear and in the other ear due to multiple instances of error. I also have the ability to hear two holes and me in the middle, slightly choked, or a single one, entrance and exit, where the words swarm and jostle like
Worm is in a state of extreme distress and unable to breathe. Worm's thorax is showing signs of wear and tear, rot spreading down his body, and he has the possibility of crawling. Worm interprets a faint, hissing hissing noise as the breath of life being recalled to those whom it corrodes. There are lights that go out hissing, indicating his distress and terror. The lights have been there for so long that they may have made a hole in the wall to observe his progress. The only noises until now are those of mohths and the groaning of the air beneath him
A character is in a place called "The UNNAMABLE 359" where he is unable to learn and has a head grown out of his ear. The head has grown from his ear and is glued to the ear. He knows no more than on the first day of his existence and suffers from a lack of understanding. When the storms rage, drowning the free expression of opinion, the character will know that the end of the world is not at hand. The character's head is a transformer, capable of turning sound into rage and terror. The circumvolutionisation of the head will be seen later when they
The peeps, or "catechists", who speak at the same time and say the same thing simultaneously, often perfectly together, often not moving from their places. God alone can fill the rose of the winds, without moving from his place. Worm, who says nothing, knows nothing yet. Those who benefit from the peep-hole, those who care to use it, are most likely to benefit from it. The peeps have the ability to make remarks based on what they have seen and their interest in it. They have no pedagogic purpose and have no intention of imparting any instruction to
 SAMUEL BECKETT is a shapeless heap with no face capable of reflecting the niceties of a torment. SAMU ELIEL has an eye and he is possessed of an eye. Samuel can't think, he can't judge anything, but he will try and go where peace seems to be.
Worm is being pursued by a group of people who want him to retreat from a certain quarter. They are making a physical barrier to prevent him from going any further. When he is unable to go any further, Worm will drop, assuming he had risen. This will be Worm's first experience of vertical support, the vertical shelter, and reinforcing those V>f the ground. Worm will never experience the joy of feeling a prori and buckler for the first time. Worm is being restored to the state in which he was before the beginning of his prehistory.
Worm is described as a being who can't set himself in motion and has the ability to move, which is a blessing and a curse for him. Worm has a life-warrant and often desires to stir from where he is, seeking calm and something of the silence of old. Worm is unable to do so due to his lack of movement.
Fen is in a vast pit with no access to the air in which he lies. The air in the pit is not for them to breathe, yet they want him to breathe theirs. They do not dare to go and fetch him from the pit because they believe he hears them. The pit is too vast for a dog to reach, even with a long pole and a hook attached. According to the latest news, Feen will have to climb to reach the pit.
Samuel Beckett lies on 362 SAMUEL BECKETT gentle slopes that meet where he lies. The slopes are not a meeting, they are not pits, and they will soon have him perched on an eminence. Samuel Beckett hears their voices and feels saved at last, home at last. They launch their voices into a hole in an attempt to dislodge him in the hope of dislodging him. Samuel believes their usefulness is over, but he doesn't want them to leave.
He is alone and mute, lost in a strange hell that has no heating, no denizens, and is surrounded by smoke. He interprets a voice, which he interprets as the voice of the blest interceding invisible, intercessing for the living and the dead. He understands nothing about the voice and believes it is a voice of those who mourn them, envy them, call on them, and forget them. The voice is incoherent and incomprehensible, but he understands it as necessary for him to avoid repeating the same filth.
An eye with no lids stays open and does not have any lids. If the user could blink, he might miss an odd sight. If he could close the eye, he would never open it again. The eye has tears gushing from it practically without ceasing, possibly caused by rage, passion, or grief. Perhaps the eye weeps in order not to see. The user is humanised and is going to lose if he doesn't take care.
Worm doesn't understand what is going on, doesn't take thought, and doesn't feel anything. However, he suffers from a noise that he understands to be a voice. Worm hears the voice but only a few expressions and intonations. According to the voice, the eye is there to put Worm to flight, make him take fright, and to break his bonds.
The conversation takes place later in the evening. SAMUEL BECKETT ing is involved in the conversation. Samuel Beckett ing has the ability to communicate with more than one person at the same time, but he might get mixed up with his victim, which would be potentially "abominable and potentially masturbation".
Worm is a character with yellow, pink, urinous and w'arm color. Worm suffers from a noise that prevents him from being what he was before. Worm craves for a stick, an arm, fingers apt to grasp and then release, stone, stones, or a power to utter a cry and wait for it to come back to him. Worm has neither voice nor other missile, nor limbs submissive to him, causing him to regret being a man.
The camera is trained on the same tiny field, unable to see it nor lift it up. The camera is a stranger to accommodation and the boons and blessings of accommodation. It is hard to see how Worm could stay and it is hard for him to go. However, impossible situa- tions can be prolonged, unduly, as they disperse or turn out to be possible after all. There are lights, in the plural, which rear aloft, swell, sweep down, and go out hissing, reminding one of the naja.
Worm is an impotent, impotent crystalline who hopes for nothing but for things to continue as they are. Worm is indifferent to the things one has to put up with and considers them insignificant. Worm believes that there must be a little of everything in every world. Grey is the colour that goes with Worm's grey-grey appearance.
Samuel Beckett is a visitor who visits at a distance at a regular level once a month. Samuel Beckett has a full face and profile like a criminal. Samusel Becket is faithful and faithful with his visiting-day and visiting-hour, never staying too long and providing space for hope to grow, grow, languish, and die. Samuel believes that space and hope have taken to going hand-in-hand in certain quarters because it's safer. Samuel is waiting for his sweetheart and the flowers.
An event occurs every instant, once a year, once every two years, and every three years, with a frequency unimportant in the early stages but important in the later stages. If the event were to stop, the player would learn to count, fret, be brave, have patience, lose patience, and be faithful. If it were to start off, his heart would be on its waltz and he would feel his heart beating in his ear.
The conversation takes place in a setting where the protagonist is waiting for something or someone. The protagonist is calm, calm, passably calm, knowing that nothing has befallen her and that nothing will befall her. She sees her place and her place has nothing to mark it, there is nothing to dis- tinguish it, and she wishes none of the other places apart from her own. She is aware of her place, she sees and feels it around her, it enfolds her, and covers her. If only the voice would stop for a second, she would know if the conversation was going to
Worm seems to be trapped in a situation where he has to be Worm. Worm feels a voice telling him to report in the light, the light of day, to hear them say "We didn't tell you you were alive and kicking." Worm has endured a lot, but he feels nothing. Worm can't move, he's rooted, and there are no bonds around him. Worm's grip is like sargasso, like molasses, and he doesn't know what it is.
The scene takes place in a place where there is no air, no sound, and only light. There is a discourse taking place which is suspicious and suspicious. The calm that precedes life is disturbed by the noise of the discourse. SAMUEL BECKETT bubbles are bursting all around, indicating that there's no air in this place. The place is described as a place of light and dark, where air is to make you choke and light is to close one's eyes. The environment is created by lamps which create light and make the environment grey. When the lamps go silent, the environment becomes dark with
They filled up the holes with lamps to prevent them from closing of themselves after departing. They used power- ful lamps, lit and trained on the within, to make the individual think they are still there. If the master commands them to come back, they will do so even if they don't know they have gone. The individual suffering from the grey is not alone, as he suffers from the noise and light.
Worm believes that if the lamps are left unattended, they will eventually stop working and become black. However, he believes the lamps may come back after long after the lights are spent and after the master has pleaded for years for them to be left alone. If the lamps stop working, there will be no further explanation of the nature of the silence. Worm believes that he will never know, as long as the silence lasts, whether it is final or just a mere lull. Worm will have to listen for the murmurs of olden silences and hold himself ready for the next instalment.
Worm sees the light in a desert, the same as every other day in every other desert. His long shadow will follow him across the desert, causing him to squirm and weep. According to his master, the master instructed Worm to do this, do that to cause suffering in the desert. Despite the suffering caused by seeing the light, Worm has no objection as long as it causes him no harm. The ozone is the only thing that matters at the desert and it sterilises, according to the master.
 SAMUEL BECKETT is an idea they have and a word they use when speaking of them. SAMU ELIZABETT suffers from a grey light which causes him to suffer. The grey light would make him suffer more and more if he tried to escape from it. Eventually, the light would drive him back to the wall and lead to the blaze, capture, and the paean. As long as Samuel Beckett suffers, there's hope for him, even though they don't need any hope. Samuel doesn't make any noise, but he makes a little whining.
The scenario suggests a metamorphosis into an unchanging future into an unchangeable past. In this scenario, the patient suffers as much as he did on the first day and continues to suffer more as time flies. However, if the patient is given lessons in keeping quiet, he will be taught to toss and turn and roll on the ground to relieve the monotony of his suffering. In the scenario where the patient has been burnt alive, there are those who rush about in every direction, without method, looking for a little cool.
An individual is seeking relief from self-diligence and flight from self. He seeks to imitate a hussar who gets up on a chair to adjust the plume of his busby. The individual suffers in the same way, with no hope of diminu- tion or dissolution. The monotony of the situation is stimulating to the individual but he finds it monotonous. The individuals who work there are doing the best they can with what they have at their disposal and are paid for.
Samuel Beckett is part of a group of fake maniacs who use a trick to trick Samuel into thinking he is doing something he doesn't know. SAMUEL BECKETT has a tendency to forget what they're saying and to forget all they say as fast as they say it.SAMUEL has blackouts where he forgets what he's saying and remembers a second behind them, allowing him to blurt it out as received. SamuEL believes he might have blackouts due to his memory loss.
The conversation takes place in a setting where the speaker is in a dungeon. The speaker expresses a strong desire to escape from the dungeon and to have the words that will save him or her from punishment. She believes that her crime is her punishment and that her punishment is what others will judge her for. She feels like a pig, dumb, uncomprehending, and possessed of no utterance but theirs.
The dark is not necessarily an oubliette for one, or one other, and it is possible that I have a companion in misfortune who is given to talking, or is condemned to talk out loud, without ceasing. I think that I might have such a companion, but it would surprise me if they loathe me. I doze off from time to time, with open eyes, and yet nothing changes. Gaps have always been present in my life, whether it's the voice stopping or the voice failing to carry to me.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where words have been said but need to be ratified by a proper authority before they can be implemented. The speaker, the speaker, is responsible for choosing the words that count. In the meantime, a messenger goes towards the master and examines the verbatim report of the proceedings. The messenger returns with the verdict and an order to stop everything or to co-operate with the proper authority.
The conversation takes place in a place where one waits to know one's fate. SAMUEL BECKETT suggests that there is something about not being able to die, live, be born, staying where one is, not knowing where they came from, or where they are going, or if it's possible to be elsewhere.
"There was a time in the past when there was nothing for one to do but to get to the end, or fly from it, or wait for its arrival or to get through it.""There is a voice that prevents one from being nothing and prevents them from being nowhere.""The voice is a meaningless voice that keeps alight a little yellow flame, darting from side to side and panting, as if straining to tear itself from its wick.""Regretting helps one move towards the end of the world because regretting what is and regretting the past is what gets one on towards
Mahood is in a state of despair and regretting not being able to bear any more. Mahood is depicted as a character who is in an urn and is singing "I come, I come and I come, my heart's delight." Perhaps another character named Worm, also known as Worm, is also in a similar state. If I were a tradesman, I would set rats on Mahood, water-rats or sewer-rats to help him make up his mind.
Mahood's existence has been insufficiently studied, leading to confusion and disquisitions about his existence and potential reality. They make a mistake in thinking of Mahood as if he exists in a specific place and treating him as a project for the moment. They are compelled to speak of something that is already established and accessible to understanding, such as something the existence of which has been established.
They don't know who they are or what they're doing. They don't achieve what they want and they don't understand the obscure infamy to which they are committed. They build up hypotheses that collapse on top of each other, leading to chaos and chaos. The gang is not the same gang as a moment ago. Each individual in the gang has been scandalously bungled.
 SAMUEL BECKETT describes a blind voice and the moments of held breath when all listen for signs of life. Samuel believes that if all that could stop, there would be peace. Samuel suggests that the blind can hear better and are more generalizable, suggesting that they have more general knowledge than those who are not blind. Samuel believes that Mahood is responsible for the blind voice.
Mahood is a great weeper who weeps for even the smallest things. Mahood is cold as a fish and incapable of cursing his creator. Worm, also known as Mahood, has a weeper's beard that is soaking with muck. Worm and Mahood seem to have the ability to forget everything.
Mahood is stuck up to his skull in a vase, opposite the shambles. Mahood has no vent at his disposal and is unable to express his feelings. Mah Hood is expecting the passers-by to perceive him ostensibly, concomitantly with the day’s dish, or independently, for reasons unknown. He believes that perceptions are guaranteed to sink and that he has no choice but to remain where he is.
Samuel Beckett is questioning the ability to think and act simultaneously. Samuel Beckett suggests that people repeat the same old litany, the one they know by heart, and engage in a self-reproach, which prevents them from thinking of different ways of saying things. SamUel Becket suggests that without a special gift, one's thoughts wander, their words drift, and their thoughts and words become far apart. Samuel believes that if one were to suffer, rejoice, and feel bereft of speech and thought, they would be in a place where they would feel nothing.
They are a group of people who are there to bear the responsibility of this state of affairs. They are voluble and have the capacity to make one believe they are responsible for the situation. The master is not a high official and they don't intend to approach him unless they are driven to it. The family circle is intimate and they all know each other, so there are no surprises to be feared.
The setting is described as a place where one sets out to look for a face and returns having found only a kind of ashen smear, possibly a long grey hair greasy with ancient tears, or the fringe of a mantle spread like a veil, fingers opening and closing to try and shut out the world, or fingers, hair, and rags mingled inextricably. The character in the role-play is hairless and naked and is in no danger of getting into mischief. He does not believe in the eye and believes there is nothing to see.
The conversation takes place in a setting that is not particularly interesting and offers little interest to me, but I am willing to accept it because it is my turn to be shown impossible. I believe that this conversation will never end and there is no sense in fooling oneself. I think that after me, the conversation will end because people will give up believing that they have been told a lot of lies. The third party, the master, is the one to blame for the current state of affairs. Neither the master nor the other suspects are innocent, neither are they, and they were foolish to accuse one another.
The conversation takes place in an arena after the massacres, where there is a sense of utter silence and utter chaos. There are people who are expected to depart or drop to the ground and never move again due to the lack of understanding or understanding. SAMUEL BECKETT is supposedly from a place called 3&0, but he doesn't know what it is or what he is meant to do there.
The bright boy of the class is the one who always comes to the rescue when things go wrong and saves situations. He has saved more than one person and has the ability to stimulate the spirit and stop the rot with one word. He suffers from suffering, which initially dampens his joy, but he quickly makes up for it by invoking the celebrated notions of quantity, hrfoit-formation, wear and tear, and others. He is in a position to declare inapplicable the case before hiita due to his limitless wits. He questions if they have ever done anything else during the past and questions what

The conversation takes place in a setting where there is a human shape. The human shape has a painful moment on the surface and a peaceful underbelly. There is a person present in the human shape who appears to be in a state of distress. The person depicted in the photograph is depicted as a person dying on his feet. The individual in the photo is identified by the name of a person who has not stirred and has not said anything.
Samuel Beckett is in a place where Mahood and Worm are unable to get him out. 382 SAMUEL BECKETT sees himself as a different type of person, different from all the others, and believes he is the only one like him. Samuel Beckett believes that if there is only one person like him, he can depart without remorse, having done all he could and achieved the impossible and lost his life to achieve it. 381 Samuel Beckett announces his decisions at the top of his voice.
The role-playing character has been having a dream about a scenario where he and another person, unknown to each other, meet unbeknownst to themselves. The scenario involves the two characters being trapped in a situation where they are unaware of each other. The role-play takes place in a world where the other person is trapped and has no idea what has happened to the other one. In the scenario, the role-player character has to coax the other character out of the situation and back to his family.

I THE UNNAMABLB 383 is weary of pleading an incomprehensible cause and decides to drop among the con- tumacious, nice images of the Pulit Zer Prize. The Pulit Zer Prize is a form of punishment intended to catch spermatozoon alive for the purpose of killing him. The sperm is not in a womb and the slut has yet to menstruate, which narrows the field of research.
Mahood and Worm are characters involved in a notorious story. Despite the notorious nature of the stories, Mahood believes there is nothing to gain from them and that they will never learn sense from them. Mahood has his own stories and believes that if he tells them, it will be the end of their stories.
Samuels Beckett has the flux, a form of birth-induced colic. He believes that people will learn from his experiences that it's not as easy as it looks, that one must have a taste for it, and that it requires being born alive to experience it.
I used to have the duty to bring back to the fold a person who I was told was dear to me, dear to him, and dear to each other. However, I no longer have the capacity to do so. I have been thinking about this person for a long time and have been trying to find him all my life, wondering what he could possibly be like and wondering where they could possibly have met. Until I joined him, I was de#r to them and now it's they who are dear to her. They are a group of renegades and they will join us, one by one,
T believes she is the first and the last and responsible for her own suffering. T believes that she has never made anyone suffer, she has not stopped anyone's suffering, and no one will ever stop hers. She believes she will never know peace and neither will they. The voice in T's head is saying that she suffers and that she would feel better if she did this, which would make her feel The UNNAMABLE 38 $ better. T doesn't know how to understand what the voice is talking about, but she believes that if she doesn't understand these things, how would she feel better?
The conversation takes place during a public show where the audience buys a seat and waits for the show to begin. The audience is expected to be waiting for the compulsory show, which is a recitation, selected passages, old favourites, a poetry matinee, or an improvising performance. The voice of the stage-manager is heard in the background giving instructions and recommendations before the curtain rises. The stage-man is alone in his dressing room, only preluding, clearing his throat, and leaving the dressing room.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT is alone, waiting alone, in the rest-less air, waiting for something to begin or for something else to start. SAMU ELIEL is blind, deaf, blind, or possibly deaf, and he is waiting for a hand to draw him away from his current situation and take him somewhere else for free, gratis, and for nothing.SAMUEL has a preference for a certain thing, but he no longer prefers it and prefers something else.
I believe that I have been deceived by someone and that their attitude towards me has not changed. I don't understand what they were trying to do to me. I feel a jostle of words in my mouth and wonder if there is a mouth or head on me, but I can't feel any. I do not feel a mouth, nor a head, nor do I feel an ear. I believe that the "'ords" are there, somewhere, without the least sound, but neither me nor the 'ords' feel them.
I feel an outside and an inside and I'm in the middle of the world. I can hear and understand what is being said but I can't understand what's being said. I perceive myself as a thing that divides the world in two, on one side the outside and the other side the inside, with a thin, thin surface that can be thin as foil. I am neither one side nor the other of the partition, I have two surfaces and no thickness, and I feel myself vibrating. I perceives myself as the tympanum, which is a part of the mind and the world,
The UNNAMABLE 387 believes that they know nothing and think they never change, stating that they will continue saying the same thing until they die. The UNNOMABLE 387 considers themselves immortal, stating they can't get born and can't change. They believe that they have saved a man and that for him, his troubles will be over and he will have a good time, a brilliant career, and forgive himself.
"I go mad, but I don't know what kind of madness I go mad with.""It's possible to go mad at any time of the day or night and I'm not sure which one it is.""The shadows are all that matters, only the shadows, with no life of their own, no shape and no respite.""I depart towards my brethren who depart without knowing where they are going and without knowing if they will ever return to their master.""There is a possibility to sue for their freedom, it's pos- sible and possible.""They stop to listen to my screams
Samuel Beckett is a character in a political discussion. Samuel Beckett proposes a scenario where the structure of the system is unchanged and there is no change in the structure. He suggests that if there were to be a change in structure, it would require a disturbance or subsidence to start things off. This disturbance would spread to every part of the structure and eventually lead to a disturbance in the whole structure. Sam Samuel Becket suggests various forms of travel, including business trips, pleasure trips, research expeditions, sabbatical leaves, honeymoons at home and abroad, and long sad solitary tramps in
I am involved in an ongoing affair and don't know what the affair is about. I feel stuck in some process and haven't yet come to an understanding of it. I know that I've got nowhere to go in the affair. The affair galls me because they want me there somewhere, anywhere, if only they would stop focusing on me and focus on the purpose to be achieved. I have no illusions about having begun one day or ever being able to conclude the process. I find it difficult not to look forward to his end and to look back to a time when he did not exist. I believe that
The conversation takes place after the events of the story "The UNNAMABLE 3?9".9 The story is about the same old story being told to pass the time.9 The stories have been telling themselves for as long as anyone can remember.9 According to the conversation, time seems to pass without any particular reason. 9 The characters are seeking the cause of their stories, trying to find the cause and never ceasing, losing and finding it again, and seeking again.
The speaker is seeking for something to do but doesn't know what it is yet. He suggests that they seek out a pertinent objection before seeking specific action. The speaker is talking incessantly, seeking to understand who he is, what he is seeking, who he's seeking, and what he's done to them. He believes that Vdiere is man and seeks to understand him. He is talking unceasingly, seeking for answers in himself, outside himself, and cursing man, God, and others.
I am in a place where I've always been and have always been before. I am mute and unable to understand what others want or what they are talking about. I question who is talking, who is not talking, and what has I done to them, God, and the others. I believe that we are innocent, we have done nothing to God and he is innocent.
3S0 SAMUEL BECK ETT is struggling to understand what is going on around him and is expressing frustration and despair. He stops trying to understand and believes he is alone and has no need of anyone or anything. He feels nothing, as if he is talking, thirsting, starving, and in an ice aid in a furnace. He doesn't feel a mouth on him, and he doesn't need a mouth any more. He has no thickness, no need for a head, and no need to have a mouth. The words are everywhere, inside him, outside him, even though he used
"I am all these flakes, meeting, mingling, falling asunder, meeting and meeting again, meeting again and again, and becoming a particle of me, retrieved, lost, lost and gone astray.""All these words, all tl^ese strangers, come together to say, fleeing one another, merging, merging and never meeting.""I'm something quite different, a wordless thing in an empty place, a hard shut dry cold black place where nothing stirs, nothing speaks, and I listen and seek, like a caged beast born of caged beasts, born in a cage
"The fury is past and fear is present, but there is nothing left but fear of sound, of beasts, the sounds of men, and of men." "There is only one continuous sound, continuous, day and night, and it is the sound of steps coming and going, voices speaking for a THE UNNAMABLE 311 moment, the air, and bodies groping their way." "The sound of the air is the air among the things, it's the air that I seek, like it, like me, in my own way."
The conversation takes place in a silent place with thick walls. The conversation is about how one manages to manage without feeling an ear on her or a head, or a body or a soul. According to the conversation, it's not clear what is going on in this place.
"I am seeking something and it is tiring in the end." "I am trying to understand how I manage to do what I'm doing under such conditions. I want to find out what I've done and how I managed to do it.""I hear what you're doing and want to know how it's possible." "You say I hear and that I seek, but it's a lie." "Let's leave it and let's listen to them now." "How I manage, to understand, and to hear and to understand"
 SAMUEL BECKETT 3$2 is a simple arithmetic equation consisting of a hundred thousand, a million, and a hundred dollars.SAMUEL is not in a fortunate position to have grasped all the expressions in the equation, but he acknowledges that there is I, which he feels is essential and it's preferable. Samuel is aware of the distinction between I and a noise, which is likely to be the topic of their next deliberation. Samuel is prepared to take advantage of the opportunity to sum up the situation by saying that there was I on one hand and the noise on the other.
The noise seems to be inverting the natural order, which is something we would seem to know for certain. I have only just Jaken over my functions and I and this noise. I am doing my best to understand the nature of the noise and understand its nature.
It is difficult to determine the source of the noise. It is not possible to determine with certainty or even approximately what the noise is or how it comes to me, or what organ or organ it comes from. The noise can be influenced by perception or intelligence.
The investigation into The UNNAMABLE 313 is taking longer than expected due to the nature of the topic. The investigation has yet to establish with any degree of accuracy what I am or where I am, and whether I am words among words or silence in the midst of silence. I recall only two hypotheses launched in this connection: I have the ability to hear and communicate and I can't stop speaking without ceasing. I use ellipse ellipses to communicate.
I find, find, lose, find again, throw away, seek again, and never throw anything away. I have never lost anything and have never found anything that I might have thrown away. If it is I who is seeking, and if it's not, I conclude that there is nothing else I can do to pass the time. I question why time doesn't pass, why it piles up all about you, accumulating on all sides, deeper and deeper, thicker and thicker, and why it buries you with no memory, no hope, no knowledge, no history, and no prospects.
"Time doesn't pass, just like that, off the record, en passant, to pass the time.""If it's T, I don't want to ask any more questions if it's not T.""Resolutely, resolutely, more resolutions.""Make abundant use of the principle of parsimony, as if it were familiar to me.""Assume that the thing said and the thing he^rd have a common source and locate this common source in me, without considering the consciousness of third parties and an 394 SAMUFL BECKETT outer world."
The protagonist has overcome a fatal leaning towards expressiveness and has chosen to create a world of his own, sometimes referred to as the inner world. He has decided to abandon his past self and take advantage of his new soul and substantiality. Something has changed in him, but he has not mentioned Mahood, or Worm, for the past.
I have spent a lot of time with these bran-dips, beginning with Murphy, who was not the first. I have spent time on prem- ises, on the outskirts of the city, and on the streets, living in solitude and neglect. The UNNAMABLE 3$5 is the only thing that matters to me and nothing else. Murphy and the others, including the two old buffers present, could not stop the things that happened to me. I doubt the existence of the world and have no faith in it.
I am not at home and my doors are shut against the howling maws. I consider opening my doors and letting myself be devoured by the maws, hoping that by doing so, I will find silence and peace. I have visited the depths and sailed for two visits to the depths during which I was unable to drown. It is 1 am and I am far away from my doors, far from my walls. I find myself in a strange mixture of sojfd and liquid, where was 1, my subject, who is no longer there or no longer the same, or has gone missing.
Samuel Beckett is a youth who is looking for his mother to kill her. It's raining and he's walking along a street with great yaws to left and right. SAMUEL BECKETT is searching for a means of staying among the living and escaping from his self-doubt. Samuel Beckett sees nothing when he looks with closed eyes, only the same as with open eyes. He is wondering what it would be like to be eyeless and to be unable to lose one's self.
I am equipped with eyes that can open and shut, possibly blue, and a head that can communicate. I have the ability to speak only when I speak no more. I now have a name for the latest surrogate, a man with doll's eyes and a doll's head filled with vile certainties and his doll’s eyes. I will have to describe him more detail to understand his capabilities. I no longer crawl between the thwarts, under the moon, in the shadow of the lash, and after the rats.
The setting is described by The UNNAMABLE 397 as an unusual hell, described as being beneath the earth with no air, no sound, no sight, no movement, and no movement beyond a score of fathoms. The UnNAMable 397 has been lashed to a stake, blindfolded, gagged, and gagged to the gullet, but he is impervious to the shafts. The eyes of the dreamer are not mine, they can only open and shut by the force of habit. The head of TheUNNAMBLE 397 is a solid, solid
The conversation takes place in a setting where the voice of a character is failing and the character is trying to find air for the first time. The character's voice has failed many times before and has even stopped many times in the past. When the voice stops speaking, the character goes silent for lack of air, but the voice will come back and the conversation will begin again. The voice is faint, faint, unintelligible, but if the character listens hard, it will flare up like a kindling fire and emerge from silence.
The silence SAMUEL BECKETT is seeking is the one he has tried to earn, the one that he thought he could earn. The silence is murmurous with muted lamentation, panting and exhaling of impossible sorrow, like distant laughter, and brief spells of hush, and will be the same as ever, long or short, unless it's the real silence, when he has said something that gives him the right to do with speech, listening, and hearing what he wants to do. Samuel BecketT knows that no matter what he says, the result is the same
There is no one left to talk to and there is a sense of peace unless one tries to say what needs to be said about them. If one doesn't express what they feel is a mistake or sin, they will have nothing more to say and nothing to hear until they die. According to her, she feels she has made a mistake and that this is her sin. She is glad that there is no more one left and she plans to try again.
The story takes place in a scenario where someone is talking to you about you, another person, and a third figure, giving you an idea of what is going on. Eventually, the character goes silent and the conversation is short-lived, as if they had forgotten about it. The voice of the person talking to the character is not theirs and is not speaking to anyone else but the character, suggesting that it is the one talking to them. As the character's breath fails, she hears someone calling her.
The conversation takes place in a place where there is no one left to talk to and there is nothing left for one to talk about. Even if there were things, a scrap of nature, that one could talk about, it would be difficult to reconcile the idea of being the talker. The conversation suggests that to go silent is to be punished for having gone silent, implying that one will be punished if they do not go silent.
The story takes place in a wilderness with a voice that describes time as a chronicle and every second as the worst. The narrator is three seconds old, has been away, done something or been in a hole, and just crawled out of a hole. The narration describes the passage of time as jerkily jerky, with no flow and no flow, as seconds pass, they arrive, bang, bang and bounce off, bounce off and fall and never move again. In order to remember what she has said, the narrator has to repeat the same thing over and over again.
Worm's name is Worm and Mahood's name was Mahood, but they don't remember seeing each other any more. I remember two names: Worm, who I can still see better than I can see myself, and I remember talking about him and the same words recur in my memories. I invented the names Worm, Mahood and many others in order to create memories without speaking of me. I was never told to speak of me, so I invented my memories without knowing what I was doing. I thought 400 SAMUEL BECKETT would suit me.
I have experienced three things in my life: the inability to speak, being silent and being unable to be silent, and being alone in a place where no voice can reach me. I did what I could to do but often gave up due to exhaustion. I have heard a voice being heard, a voice which could not be mine since I had none left and could only be mine. Now I can speak of my life, but I'm too tired for niceties. I don't know if I ever lived and I have no opinion on the subject. I think I will soon go silent for good despite it being prohibited
I have been speaking for a long time and have spoken a lot, which has made me feel as if I have spoken long and valiantly. I thought about going silent before being dead in order to enjoy living in silence. I don't know why I wanted to be silent before death, but it seems to have been a desire to return to the place where I always was and could never rest in peace. I didn't want to die as a stranger in my own land, in the midst of strangers and surrounded by invaders. I imagined many things while I was talking, with longings and visions merging in one
The conversation takes place in a setting where things are happening in a certain way. According to The UNNAMABLE individual, things didn't start the way they are happening now. The UnNAMable individual doesn't believe what she is saying and doesn't know what she's saying. She is doing as she always did and is going on as best she can. She has always believed she would go silent for good and has believed it for a long time. However, she does not believe in her own words.
If I had a job to do, such as sorting things or arranging things, and I had to move things from one place to another, I would know where I was and how far away I was from the place I was going. However, if I had the job of moving things, I wouldn't be able to know where or how close I was. I can see it from her#, which suggests that they would contrive things in such a way that I couldn't suspect the two vessels to be emptied and filled.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where a person is responsible for filling and emptying containers of water with a thimble. The containers are described as being com-plicated, less symmetrical, and arranged in accordance with homo-logies. Each container is made up of four or a hundred parts, half of them to be filled and numbered, and the other half to be emptied, numbered and filled in a certain order. Each part of the container is connected to a network of pipes under the floor by pipes and taps. The pipes are visible from the platform.
Samuel Beckett believes that the quicker one does something, the more important it is to listen to. 461 SAMU ELIZABETH believes that water has great value and the least drop spilt on the way or in the act of drawing or pouring would cost her dear. 462 SAMUEL BECKETT believes that it would be dark and impossible to do such work in the dark and that there is no window from where he is. 463 SAMUel Beckett has told another story about herself, about the life that might have been hers and about the difference it would have made for Jy
The fable involves a character who comes and goes a lot, moving around his casks, dropping hili thimbles, listening to his thimble bouncing and rolling on the floor, scraping around for it with his foot, and crawling. The character has never seen himself before and doesn't remember ever making acquaintance with anyone before. The fable takes place in a place where the character sees himself coming and going and trying to stop his hand from trembling. In the fable, the character believes that he will never see the character again, but he believes he will see him again.
I believe that I am always ageing and that ageing makes no difference. I am good at describing places, walls, ceiling, floors, doors, windows, and locations. I've experienced many places, some opened on the sea and closed on the sky, some were wordy-gurdy-like, others were doorless, and others were even windowless. I have decided to speak only about myself and not to talk about anyone else.
1M is describing a place where she would like to get to know and remember it. 1M describes the place as a solid lump, solid in the middle, in a corner, and propped up on three sides. She describes the solid lump as solid, solid, and well-propped up.1M doesn't know what the place is and describes it as being like air and feeling no place around her. She feels like there is no end to her and doesn't have the ability to describe it.
I have memories of a sea, a row- boat, a river, and the river, but none of them are mine. I remember a time when nothing was too good for me and others benefited from it. I have tried to recall these memories but they are not mine. If I could be in a forest, thicket, or wandering around in circles, it would be the end of this journey.
Samuel Beckett has experienced a traumatic event that has taken the heart out of him. Samuel Beckett's heart isn't in him any more and he wants to find himself in his own little corner. Samuel is tired and wants to stop seeking for himself and focus only on his own thoughts. Samuel notices that the others have vanished completely and doesn't like it, but he goes on as best he can to cope with the situation. Samuel Bennett believes that he has passed by the traumatic event and that it will pass on and some-thing else will be there.
"I will remember it as I go along, all adown it, thinking that I will be born and born, births and births, and come to night without having been. I look at Tunis pink at the dawn and feel a desire to shut myself up and make a place, but I don't feel any place for me. I decide to make Mt. Mt. Etiopia mine and put myself in it, hoping to put someone else in it as well. "I will close my eyes and talk about my lifewell, hoping that the place will keep me and someone else inside each other and
The conversation takes place in the early morning hours of a given morning. The conversation is about a person who has been called to call that morning and is struggling with a choice. The words "the dayspring" and "the bright stain" are used in the conversation. The person has a strong sense of smell from the stable and decides not to seek her home due to fear that it would be occupied and someone would live there who would not want her. She considers asking questions to find out what she should do.
The protagonist has come back from a far place and has not done anything else all his life. The protagonist has a knack for topography and is good at describing topography. When plans fail, the protagonist has time for a cud of ljnging to rise up in the back of his gullet.
Laughter helps to get you over the "pretty pass" or "pretty things you have to listen to". It's not me speaking, it's not I hearing, and I'm not the only one in the world. Some people are absent or absent from the world, others are not obliged to make their self-presences manifest. Someone speaks, someone hears, and it doesn't matter if it's I, or another, or others. I know who I am and who I know I cannot say I am.
SAMUEL BECKETT is trying to understand what it means to speak, to hear, to know nothing, and to be capable of doing anything, but is unable to do so due to overwhelming noise that patties her away. 406 SAMUEL believes that she is not herself and is not capable of understanding what it is to try and understand what is happening to her. 406 Samuel asks for someone to speak to her of him and let her speak of him, as she has never asked for anything and never asked to be spoken of. 406Samuel believes that if she could forget him, she would
I have forgotten my apodosis. I was nearly there and was nearly sleeping, but I don't hear any more. I hear a horrible noise coming back from a place where I was sleeping. I know that it's not my fault and there was never anyone else but me. I have no objection to the term "sleeping" and consider it a form of reasoning. Before they deserted me, they must have taught me reasoning. I don’t remember the period before they deserted, but it must have marked me.apodosis, sleeping, no one but me, there was no one else but
"The UNNAMABLE 4W thing" is a phrase that keeps recurring in the conversation. "I have always been here, there was never anyone else, and I've always been churning old slush to be churned everlastingly." "A minute ago it was dust, now it's slush, and it must have rained." "I believe in progress and believe in believing in progress, I know how to believe and I have never learnt anything, no one ever taught me anything." "T^jat helps you on, he believes in progress. HI must have travelled,
He speaks of me as if I were he or someone else, as if he lived or saw some who had, and as if others were others. He refers to me as Murphy, or Molloy, or as if 1 were Malone. He claims to be the afflicted and seeks me out. He wants to be he, or another, or to rise up into him, or up into another, to be fair and impartial. He believes he has caught me and feels me in him.
Samuel Beckett is a character who can't move, can't talk, and can only talk. Samuel Beckett believes he speaks because he perceives himself speaking as if he were someone else and perceives confusion as a sin. SAMUEL BECKETT believes the confusion caused by the use of pronouns is caused by his lack of a name or a pronoun for himself.
The conversation is about a man on duty who speaks of himself. Neither the man nor the woman he is speaking of is concerned with any specific person or thing. They are concerned with speaking of something unknown to them, whether it is a person or something that exists anywhere, or is present in their environment.
I don't know who or what is going on and I don't have any idea who it is about. I think it's about a person who knows nothing, wants nothing, and can do nothing. He is described as having no capacity to hear, speak, or do anything. I have no opinion and I have nothing to say. I can't feel a Hiouth on me, which means nothing to me.
The UNNAMABLE 4Q9 doesn't feel any arms on her. If she could feel something on her, it would be a starting-point, a starting point. She knows what it is but she doesn't know how to do it. Perhaps it's one of those gifts that can't be acquired. The silence, a word on the silence, in the silence is the worst, to speak of silence and then lock her up, lock someone up.
I'm creating a place, a little world, which I believe will be round, but I'm unsure if it will be low, low of ceiling, thick of wall, or low of floor or high of ceiling. I'm trying to find out what it would be like to create this little world and to put someone in it. I have no idea who I am or how I would manage in this world. I don't know who or how to manage in the world created by me.
Someone must have explained to me what it's like to have an eye, an eye looking out of a window, looking at the sea, the earth, before the sky, and against the air, opening and shutting, grey, black, grey and black. I must have understood what an eye is because I wanted it, wanted the eye for my own, and tried to understand it. The things they've told me and the things I've tried have been useful to me, and they come back to me in useful ways when I think of them. The old thoughts are old thoughts, shreds of old visions
Samuel Beckett believes that the devil showed him how to survive in a dark place, how to interact with people, and how to communicate with nature. Samuel Beckett also believes that Mahood, like Mahood before him, showed him everything he needed to survive. SAMUEL BECKETT believes that he has existed in rooms, in sheds, in caves, in caverns, in woods, or in rooms or caves and that he is lost. He doesn't remember who left him, leaving him feeling tempted and lost.
I believe in progress, I believe in silence, and believe in a few words on the silence. I believe it is possible to create a world where I am far away or stowed away somewhere, hidden away behind walls, for the rest of eternity. I think that if there is only one space and someone within it, it will be enough to sustain me for eternity. It is evening and I call it an evening. I wish Y&U could see it and believe it this evening.
They love each other and marry in order to express their love better. He goes to the wars and dies at the wars. She marries him after he comes back from the war, but he didn't die at the war. She meets him at the train station and he dies in the train, expressing emotion at the thought of seeing her again and having her again. When she goes back to the house, one of them is dead and the other one is dead. He hangs himself in the house after the mother-in-law takes him down. The story taught me the nature of emotion and what emotion can
The protagonist is a character named UNNAMABLE 4U, who is portrayed as a mother-in-law and has a son who is described as a "unnamable 4U" and cries. The protagonist finds the house-door bolted after returning from the station. The door, which is a wooden door, is believed to have been bolted for some purpose, possibly to teach her how to reason or to tempt her to go to a place where things can come to an end. The story suggests that the person who bolted the door is the daughter-inlaw or the son, not the son and
There is a place where there is a silence and I emerge from it to speak of it. I don't understand duration or duration of the silence. I know I speak of the four seasons and different parts of the day and night, but I can't remember how long I've been in this place. I remember the words they taught me without making their meaning clear and all the images they showed me were on lists with images opposite. I mixed up the names of the nameless images and called them by their imagelcss names instead of their real names.
In a dark place, in the dark, there are azure, blank words that I use to represent a life. I use these words because they represent memories of events that happened in the past. I need these memories to represent the past for me to continue living. I consider a score as a palette for the memories, mixing them and varying them to create a gamut of emotions. If I could, I would mix them, mix them and vary them to represent all the things I would do if I could and if I wished.
I have drowned more than once. I have been suffocated, set fire to me, thumped on my head with wood and iron. I believe that I am the one who has drowned. I don't know what the real silence is, but I know that there is no real silence. I want the silence to go silent but it doesn't.
The conversation takes place in a scenario where the conversation falters and stops every few moments for a few moments. There is a murmur, a small voice, a mouth, throat, mouth, ears, and a car filled with vomit. Someone vomits, someone starts vomiting, and the conversation drags on. The narrator believes that the comma will come where she will drown for good. She has no explanations to offer, no one to demand, and no one else to demand.
The conversation takes place in a vast, vast and possibly infinite prison described as a hundred thousand cathedrals. The prisoner is described as being riveted, tiny, and riveted in the space, possibly in a tiny, riveted prison. The prison is large enough for a whole people to be in it and large enough to find the prisoner. If the prisoner were to give up before giving up, he would have the opportunity to start from a different place.
SAMUEL BECKETT 414 is alone, possibly the first or possibly the last person talking alone, listening alone, and listening alone. The others around him have been stilled, their voices stilled and their listening stilled by a new-com- ing. Samuel Beckett is confident that he will be with the others and that they will be as silent as he is.
The conversation takes place in a parlour where one waits for their turn to talk, listen, and wait for the next turn to go. The conversation is taking place in an unending one-way system with no end in sight. The speaker is waiting for her turn to enter and exit a place where she does not know where it is or what it's like. She doesn't know if it's big or small, if it is closed or open.
The speaker is on a rock, lashed to a rock and in the midst of a great swell of silence. The speaker perceives an image that is an image and a body, but it is not her. She perceives herself inside something and believes she is in something. She feels shut up in the silence and sees nothing but the voice and the silence outside. She believes she needs walls, good and thick, for her alone and wants to go to a prison.
The voice is blind and seeks me blindly, seeking me blindly in the dark, seeking a mouth to enter into, someone to query it, and someone to check it. The voice is waiting for me to assert myself, assert that I'm somewhere, and to put me out into the silence. I see nothing, which could be because I have no eyes or because I don't have any eyes. I have the ability to choose from a range of possibilities but I can't see anything. I believe that the voice is not The UNNAMABLE and it is not possible for me at this moment to tell a
The entity has no interest in eyes and claims to have none. The entity speaks of tears and gleams, indicating it is at a loss. Glaces can appear at dawn, dying at evening, flaring up, and fizzling out, indicating they can be short and dazzling. The entities has the ability to create hypotheses and create illusions, as in the case of the entities mentioned above.
 SAMUEL BECKETT has created a memory which is like a confession, a last confession, and an indictment. Samuel's memory is bad, the words don't come, the breath fails, and the words fail to come. The voice in the memory tells Samuel everything he needs to know, in dribs and drabs, in breath-less, breath- less form. The head of the memory speaks of Samuel Beckett's sins and wants him to repent and to give himself up. Samuels Beckett believes that a culprit is essential for the memory to be accurate.
I have a body endowed with despair and believe it will best me in the end. I believe that this body will tell me what to do in order to move, act, and act like a body imbued with despair. I don't feel a body on me and I can't stir, indicating that I'm not suffering enough yet. I hear myself reasoning, which is how I reason. I have the ability to hear but not understand or profit from what I hear.
It is not my time to understand, understand, or live. I hear everything, I understand everything, and I know the space of the way from here to the door. I know that all has been said and all must have been said, but I don't have the ability to know what I am, where I am and what I should do to stop being it, stop being there, and become another person. I can depart into life, travel the road, find the door, find an axe, or use a cord, a cord for the neck, for the throat, or for the cords, or fingers
I have heard stories about travellers and stories about atjout paralytics, which I believe to be mine. I have been telling these stories to myself, wondering where I got them from, where I store them, and where they might be stored. I believe that I am extremely old, or it's memory playing tricks, and if only I knew if I've lived, if I live, or if I'll live. I haven't stirred, and I know something else, but I always forget that.
It's an old habit for me to ignore something and continue to ignore it, as if I were absent or absent. It's his turn again, he who neither speaks nor listens, who has neither body nor soul, and who is made of silence. He is in a state of silence and is the one to be sought, sought for, spoken of, and spoken of. If he couldn't speak, I would be Ifc, I'd be the silence, and we would be back in the silence. His story is the story to be told, but he has no story, he is in his own
The story of the silence is a story of a place where SAMUEL BECKETT has never left and a story about the silence that he has experienced. The place, the silence, and the story are all words that make up SAMU ELIZABETT's memories of this place and this story. SAMU Elizabett is aware of the place and story, but doesn't know how to describe it.
The words that remain from an old story carry her into her story, which she has forgotten about. The story she is telling is the only one she has ever had and she believes it to be the only story she ever had. She believes it's too late for her to return to the old story. She is at a door and believes she has been there for a long time without knowing it. The murmurs, distant cries, and the murmurs are part of her story.
The conversation takes place in a place where there is a silence and a dream-like atmosphere full of words and murmurs. There is a person who is waiting for them there. The person believes that the person is going to stop and abandon them. If the person doesn't stop, the person will wake up in the silence and never sleep again. If they don't stop and the person continues to wait, they will reach the threshold of their story before the door opens.
