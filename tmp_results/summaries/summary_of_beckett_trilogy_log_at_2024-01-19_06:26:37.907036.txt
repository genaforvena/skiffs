I am in my mother’s room.It’s I who live there now.I don’t 
know how I got tl^pre.Perhaps in an ambulance, certainly a vehicle 
of some kind.I was helped.I’d never have got there alone.There’s 
this man who comes every week.Perhaps I got here thanks to him.He says not.He gives me money and takes away the pages.So many 
pages, so much money.Yes, I work now, a little like I used to, 
except that I don’t know how to work any more.That doesn’t 
matter apparently.What I’d like now is to speak of the things that 
arc left, say my good-byes, finish dying.They don’t want that.Yes, 
there is more than one, apparently.But it’s always the same one 
that comes.You’ll do that later, he says.Good.The truth is I 
haven’t m’’ch will left.When he comes for the fresh pages he brings 
back the previous week’s.They arc marked with signs I don’t under- 
stand.Anyway I don’t read them.When I’ve done nothing he, gives 
me nothing, he scolds me.Yet I don’t work for money.For what 
then?I don’t know.The truth is I don’t know much.For example 
my mother’s death.Was she already cjpad when I came?Or did 
she only die later?I mean enough to bury.I don’t know.Perhaps8

they haven’t buried her yet.

In any case I have her room.I sleep 
in her bed.I piss and shit in her pot.I have taken her place.I must 
resemble her more and more.All I need now is a son.Perhaps I 
have one somewhere.But I think not.He would be old now, nearly 
as old as myself.It was a little chambermaid.It wasn’t true love.The true love was in another.We’ll come to that.Her name?I’ve 
forgotten it again.It seems to me sometimes that I even knew my 
son, that I helped him.Then I tell myself it’s impossible.It’s impos- 
sible I could ever have helped anyone.I’ve forgotten how to spell 
too, and half the words.That doesn’t matter apparently.Good.He’s 
a queer one the one who conics to see me.He comes every Sunday 
apparently.The other days he isn't free.He’s always thirsty.It was 
he told me I’d begun all wrong, that I should have begun differently.He must be right.I began at the beginning, like an old ballocks, 
can you imagine that?Here’s my beginning.Because they’re keep- 
ing it apparently.I took a lot of trouble with it.Here it is.It gave 
me a lot of trouble.It was the beginning, do you understand?Whereas now it’s nearly the end.Is what I do now any better?I

unconscious of what they were doing.

It was on a road remarkably 
bare, I mean without hedges or ditches or any kind of edge, in the 
country, for cows were chewing in enormous fields, lying and stand-

embellishing, but on the whole that’s the way it was.They chew, 
swallow, then after a short pause effortlessly bring up the next 
mouthful.A neck muscle stirs and the jaws begin to grind again.But perhaps I’m remembcring’things.The road, hard and white, 
seared the tender pastures, rose and fell at the whim of hills and 
hollows.The town was not far.It was two men, unmistakably, one 
small and one tall.They had left the town, first one, then the other, 
and then the first, weary or remembering a duty, had retraced his 
steps.The air was sharp, for they wore greatcoats.They looked alike, 
but no more than others do.At first a wide space lay between them.They couldn’t have seen each other, even had they raised their 
heads and looked about, because of this wide space, and then 
because of the undulating land, which caused the road to be in 
waves, not high, but high enough, high enough.But the moment 
came when together they went down into the same trough and in 
this trough finally met.To say they knew each other, no, nothing 
warrants it.But perhaps at the sound of their steps, or warned by 
some obscure instinct, they raised their heads and observed each 
other, for a good fifteen paces, before they stopped, breast to breast.Summarization models summary:

doubt only known to him from afar, seen perhaps from his bedroom 
window or from the summit of a monument which, one black day, 
having nothing in particular to do and turning to height for solace, 
he had paid his few coppers to climb, slower and slower, up the 
winding stones.From there he must have seen it all, the plain, the 
sea.and then these selfsame hills that some call mountains, indigo 
in places in the evening light, their serried ranges crowding to the 
skyline, cloven with hidden valleys that the eye divines from sudden 
shifts of colour and then from other signs for which there are no 
words, nor even thoughts.

But all are not divined, even from that 
height, and often where only one escarpment is discerned, and one 
crest, in reality there are two, two escarpments, two crests, riven 
by a valley.But now he knows these hills, that is to say he knows 
them better, and if ever again he sees them from afar it will be I 
think with other eyes, and not only that but the within, all that 
inner space one never secs, the brain and heart and other caverns 
where thought and feeling dance their sabbath, all that too quite 
differently disposed.He looks old and it is a sorry sight to see him 
solitary after so many years, so many days and nights unthinkingly 
given to that rumour rising at birth and even earlier.What shall 
I do?What shall I do?now low, a murmur, now precise as the

gathering night, with a stick.It was a stout stick, he used it to thrust 
himself onward, or as a defence, when the time came, against dogs 
and marauders.Yes, night was gathering, but the man was innocent, 
greatly innocent, he had nothing to fear, though he went in fear, 
he had nothing to fear, there was nothing they could do to him, or 
very little.But he can’t have known it.I wouldn’t know it myself,

by an anxiety which was not necessarily his, but of which as it 
were he partook.Who knows if it wasn’t my own anxiety over- 
taking him.He hadn’t seen me.I was perched higher than the road’s 
highest point and flattened what is more against a rock the same 
colour as myself, that is grey.The rock he probably saw.He gazed 
around as if to engrave the landmarks on his memory and must 
have seen the rock in the shadow of which I crouched like Belacqua, 
or Sordello, I forget.But a man, a fortiori myself, isn’t exactly a 
landmark, because, I mean if by some strange chance he were to 
pass that way again, after a long lapse of time, vanquished, or to 
look for some lost thing, or to destroy something, his eyes would 
search out the rock, not the haphazard in its shadow of that un- 
stable fugitive thing, still living flesh.

No, he certainly didn’t see 
me, for the reasons I’ve given and then because he was in no 
humour for that, that evening, no humour for the living, but rather 
for all that doesn’t stir, or stirs so slowly that a child would scorn 
it, let alone an old man.However that may be, I mean whether he 
saw me or whether he didn’t, I repeat I watched him recede, at 
grips (myself) with the temptation to get up and follow him, perhaps 
even to catch - up with him one day, so as to know him better, be 
myself less lonely But in spite of my soul’s leap out to him, at the 
end of its elastic.I saw him only darkly, because of the dark and 
then because of the terrain, in the folds of which he disappeared 
from time to time, to re-emerge further on, but most of all I think 
because of other things calling me and towards which too one after 
the other my soul was straining, wildly.I mean, of course, the 
fields, whitening under the dew, and the animals, ceasing from 
wandering and settling for the night, and the sea, of which nothing, 
and the sharpening line of crests, and the sky where without seeing 
them I felt the first stars tremble, and my hand on my knee and 
above all the other wayfarer, A or C, I don’t remember, going 
resignedb' home.Yes, towards my hand also, which my knee felt 
tremble and of which my eyes saw the wrist only, the heavily veined

shoes, smoked a cigar.He moved with a kind of loitering indolence 
which rightly or wrongly seemed to me expressive.But all that 
proved nothing, refuted nothing.Perhaps he had come from afar, 
from the other end of the island even, and was approaching the 
town for the first time or returning to it after a long absence.A little 
dog followed him, a pomeranian I think, but I don’t think so.I 
wasn’t sure at the time and I’m still not sure, though I’ve hardly 
thought about it.The little dog followed wretchedly, after the 
fashion of pomeranians, stopping, turning in slow circles, giving up 
and then, a little further on, beginning all over again.Constipation 
is a sign of good health in pomeranians.At a given moment, pre- 
established if you like, I don't much mind, the gentleman turned 
back, took the little creature in his arms, drew the cigar from his 
lips and buried his face in the orange fleece, for it was a gentleman, 
that was obvious.Yes, it was an orange pomeranian, the less I think 
of it the more certain I am.And yet.But would he have come from 
afar, bare-headed, in sand-shoes, smoking a cigar, followed by a 
pomeranian?

Did he not seem rather to have issued from the ram- 
parts, after a good dinner, to take his dog and himself for a walk, 
like so many citizens, dreaming and farting, when the weather is 
fine?But was not perhaps in reality the cigar a c,utty.and were not 
the sand-shoes boots, hobnailed, dust-whitened, and what prevented 
the dog from being one of those stray dogs that you pick up and 
take in your arms, from compassion or because you have long been 
straying with no other company than the endless roads, sands, 
shingle, bogs and heather, than this nature answerable to another 
court, than at long intervals the fellow-convict you long to stop, 
embrace, suck, suckle and whom you pass by, with hostile eyes, for 
fear of his familiarities?Until the day when, your endurance gone, 
in this world for you without arms, you catch up in yours the first 
mangy cur you meet, carry it the time needed for it to love you and 
you it, then throw it away.Perhaps he had come to that, in spite of 
appearances.He disappeared, his head on his chest, the smoking 
object in his hand.Let me try and explain.From things about to 
disappear I turn away in time.To watch them out of sight, no, 
I can’t do it.It was in thij sense he disappeared.Looking away 
I thought of him, saying, He is dwindling, dwindling.I knew whatMOLLOY

Oh not systematically, in my life 
without end I have dabbled with every kind of sleep, but at the time 
now coming back to me I toolc my doze in the daytime and, what 
is more, in the morning.Let me hear nothing of the moon, in my 
night there is no moon, and if it happens that I speak of the stars it 
is by mistake.Now of all the noises that night not one was of those 
heavy uncertain steps, or of that club with which he sometimes 
smote the earth until it quaked.How agreeable it is to be confirmed, 
after a more or less long period of vacillation, in one’s first impres- 
sions.Perhaps that is what tempers the pangs of death.Not that I 
was so conclusively, I mean confirmed, in my first impressions with 
regard to — wait — C. For the wagons and carts which a little before 
dawn went thundering by, on their way to market with fruit, eggs, 
butter and perhaps cheese, in one of these perhaps he would have 
been found, overcome by fatigue or discouragement, perhaps even 
dead.Or he might have gone back to the town by another way 
too far away for me to hear its sounds, or by little paths through 
the fields, crushing the silent grass, pounding the silent ground.And 
so at last I came out of that distant night, divided between the 
murmurs of my little world, its dutiful confusions, and those so 
different (so different?)of all that between two suns abides and 
passes away.Never once a human voice.But the cows, when the 
peasants passed, crying in vain to be milked.A and C I never saw 
again.

But perhaps I shall see them again.But shall I be able to 
recognise them?And am I sure I never saw them again?And 
what do I mean by seeing and seeing again?An instant of silence, 
as when the conductor taps on his stand, raises his arms, before the 
unanswerable clamour.Smoke, sticks, flesh, hair, at evening, afar, 
flung about the craving for a fellow.I know how to summon these 
rags to cover my shame.I wonder what that means.But I shall not16

observe that having waked between eleven o’clock and midday (I 
heard the angelus, recalling the incarnation, shortly after) I resolved 
to go and see my mother.I needed, before I could resolve to go and 
see that woman, reasons of an urgent nature, and with such reasons, 
since I did not know what to do, or where to go, it was child’s play 
for me, the play of an only child, to fill my mind until it was rid 
of all other preoccupation and I seized with a trembling at the mere 
idea of being hindered from going there, I mean to my mother, there 
and then.So I got up, adjusted my crutches and went down to the 
road, where I found my bicycle (I didn’t know I had one) in the 
same place I must have left it.Which enables me to remark that, 
crippled though I was, I was no mean cyclist, at that period.This

I fastened my crutches to the cross-bar, one 
on either side, I propped the foot of my stiff leg (I forget which, 
now they’re both stiff) on the projecting front axle, and I pedalled 
with the other.It was a chainless bicycle, with a free-wheel, if such 
a bicycle exists.Dear bicycle, I shall not call you bike, you were 
green, like so many of your generation.I don’t know why.It is a 
pleasure to meet it again.To describe it at length would be a 
pleasure.It had a little red horn instead of the bell fashionable in 
your days.To blow this horn was for me a real pleasure, almost a 
vice.I will go further and declare that if I were obliged to record, 
in a roll of honour, those activities which in the course of my inter- 
minable existence have given me only a mild pain in the balls, the 
blowing of a rubber horn — toot!— would figure among the first.And when I had to part from my bicycle I took off the horn and 
kept it about me.I believe I have it still, somewhere, and if I blow 
it no more it is because it has gone dumb.Even motor-cars have 
no horns nowadays, as I understand the thing, or rarely.When I 
see one, through the lowered window of a stationary car, I often 
stop and blow it.This should all be re-written in the pluperfect.What a rest to speak of bicycles and horns.Unfortunately it is not 
of them I have to speak, but of her who brought me into the world, 
through the hole in her arse if my memory is correct.First taste

off the machine, I remained astride it, my feet on the grottnd, my 
arms on the handle-bars, my head on my arms, and I waited until 
I felt better.But before I leave this earthly paradise, suspended 
between the mountains and the sea, sheltered from certain winds 
and exposed to all that Auster vents, in the way of scents and 
langours, on this accursed country, it would ill become me not to 
mention the awful cries of the corncrakes that run in the corn, in 
the meadows, all the short summer night long, dinning their rattles.And this enables me, what is more, to know when that unreal 
journey began, the second last but one of a form fading among 
fading forms, and which I here declare without further ado to have 
begun in the second or third week of June, at the moment that is 
to say most painful of all when over what is called our hemisphere 
the sun is at its pitilessmost and the arctic radiance comes pissing 
on our midnights.It is then the corncrakes are heard.My mother 
never refused to see me, that is she never refused to receive me, 
for it was many a long day since she had seen anything at all.I 
shall try and speak calmly.Summarization models summary:

of whether to call her Ma, Mag or the Countess Caca, she having 
for countless years been as deaf as a post.

I think she was quite 
incontinent, both of faeces and water, but a kind of prudishness 
made us avoid the subject when we met, and I could never be 
certain of it.In any case it can’t have amounted to much, a few 
niggardly wetted goat-droppings, every two or three days.The room 
smelt of ammonia, oh not merely of ammonia, but of ammonia, 
ammonia.She knew it was me, by my smell.Her shrunken, hairy 
old face lit up, she was happy to smell me.She jabbered away with 
a rattle of dentures and most of the time didn’t realize what she 
was saying.Anyone but myself would have been lost in this clat- 
tering gabble, which can only have stopped during her brief instants 
of unconsciousness.In any case I didn’t come to listen to her.I got 
into communication with her by knocking on her skull.One knock 
meant yes, two no, three I don’t know, four money, five goodbye.I was hard put to ram this code into her ruined and frantic under- 
standing, but I did it, in the end.That she should confuse yes, no, 
I don’t know and goodbye, was all the same to me, I confused them 
myself.But that she should associate the four knocks with anything 
but money was something to be avoided at all ( costs.During the 
period of training therefore, at the same time as I administered the 
four knocks on her skull, I stuck a bank-note under her nose or in 
her mouth.In the innocence of my heart !Summarization models summary:

was too great, from one to four.By the time she came to the fourth 
knock she imagined she was only at the second, the first two having 
been erased from her memory as completely as if they had never 
been felt, though I don’t quite see how something never felt can 
be erased from the memory, and yet it is a common occurrence.She must have thought I was saying no to her all the time, whereas 
nothing was further from my purpose.Enlightened by these con-

slobber.A head that darkened the air.Not that seeing matters, but 
it’s something to go on with.It was I who took the key from under

Modestly, I pointed to my crutches and ventured one or two 
noises regarding my infirmity, which obliged me to rest as I could, 
rather than as I should.But there are not two laws, that was the next

another for the sick, but one only to which all must bow, rich and

I knew it a moment later.Not at all, I said, not at all.Your papers!he cried.Ah my papers.Now the only papers I carry with me are 
bits of newspaper, to wipe myself, you understand, when I have a 
stool.Oh I don’t say I wipe myself every time I have a stool, no, 
but I like to be in a position to do so, if I have to.Nothing strange 
about that, it seems to me.In a panic I took this paper from my 
pocket and thrust it under his nose.The weather was fine.We took 
the little side streets, quiet, sunlit, I springing along between my 
crutches, he pushing my bicydle, with the tips of his white-gloved 
fingers.I wasn’t — I didn’t feel unhappy.I stopped a moment, I 
made so bold, to lift my hand and touch the crown of my hat.It 
was scorching.I felt the faces turning to look after us, calm faces 
and joyful faces, faces of men, of women and of children.I seemed 
to hear, at a certain moment, a distant music.

I stopped, the better 
to listen.Go on, he said.Listen, I said.Get on, he said.I wasn’t 
allowed to listen to the music.It might have drawn a crowd.He 
gave me a shove.I had been touched, oh not my skin, but none 
the less my skin had felt it, it had felt a man’s hard fist, through 
its coverings.While still putting my best foot foremost I gave 
myself up to that golden moment, as if I had been someone else.It was the hour of rest, the forenoon’s toil ended, the afternoon’s 
to come.The wisest perhaps, lying in the squares or sitting on their 
doorsteps, were savouring its languid ending, forgetful of recent 
cares, indifferent to those at hand.Others on the contrary were 
using it to hatch their plans, their heads in their hands.Was there 
one among them to put himself in my place, to feel how removed 
I was then from him I seemed to be, and in that remove what strain, 
as of hawsers about to snap?It’s possible.Yes, I was straining 
towards those spurious deeps, their lying promise of gravity and 
peace, from all my old poisons I struggled towards them, safely 
bound.CJnder the blue sky, under the watchful gaze.Forgetful of

not identify.I had time to become aware of these details before 
he dismissed me.He listened to his subordinate’s report and then 
began to interrogate me in a tone which, from the point of view 
of civility, left increasingly to be desired, in my opinion.Between 
his questions and my answers, I mean those deserving of considera- 
tion, the intervals were more or less long and turbulent.I am so 
little used to being asked anything that when I am asked something 
I take some time to know what.And the mistake I make then is 
this, that instead of quietly reflecting on what I have just heard, 
and heard distinctly, not being hard of hearing, in spite of all I 
have heard, I hasten to answer blindly, fearing perhaps lest my 
silence fan their anger to fury.I am full of fear, I have gone in 
fear all my life, in fear of blows.Insults, abuse, these I can easily 
bear, but I could never get used to blows.It’s strange.Even spits 
still pain me.But they have only to be a little gentle, I mean refrain 
from hitting me, and I seldom fail to give satisfaction, in the long 
run.

Now the sergeant, content to threaten me with a cylindrical 
ruler, was little by little rewarded for his pains by the discovery 
that I had no papers in the sense this word had a sense for him, 
nor any occupation, nor any domicile, that my surname escaped 
me for the moment and that I was on my way to my mother, whose 
charity kept me dying.As to her address, I was in the dark, but 
knew how to get there, even in the dark.The district?By the 
shambles your honour, for from my mother’s room, through the 
closed windows, I had heard, stilling her chatter, the bellowing of 
the cattle, that violent raucous tremulous bellowing not of the 
pastures, but of the towns, their shambles and cattle-markets.Yes, 
after all, I had perhaps gone too far in saying that my mother 
lived near the shambles, it could equally well have been the cattle- 
market, near which she lived.Never mind, said the sergeant, it’s 
the same district.I took advantage of the silence which followed 
these kind words to turn towards the window, blindly or nearly, 
for I had closed my eyes, proffering to that blandness of blue and 
gold my face and neck alone, and my mind empty too, or nearly,

after such a long time standing, and remembering what I had learnt 
in that connection, namely fliat the sitting posture was not for meMOLLOY

Conscious 
of my wrongs, knowing now the reasons for my arrest, alive to my 
irregular situation as revealed by the enquiry, I was surprised to 
find myself so soon at freedom once again, if that is what it was, 
unpenalised.Had I, without my knowledge, a friend at court?Had 
I, without knowing it, favourably impressed the sergeant?Had they 
succeeded in finding my mother and obtaining from her, or from 
the neighbours, partial confirmation of my statements?Were they 
of the opinion that it was useless to prosecute me?To apply the 
letter of the law to a creature like me is not an easy matter.It can 
be done, but reason is against it.It is better to leave things to the 
police.I don’t know.If it is unlawful to be without papers, why 
did they not insist on my getting them.Because that costs money 
and I had none?But in tha^case could they not have appropriated 
my bicycle?Probably not, without a court order.All that is in-MOLLOY

comprehensible.What is certain is this, that I never rested in that 
way again, my feet obscenely resting on the earth, my arms on the 
handlebars and on my arms my head, rocking and abandoned.It 
is indeed a deplorable sight, a deplorable example, for the people, 
who so need to be encouraged, in their bitter toil, and to have 
before their eyes manifestations of strength only, of courage and 
of joy, without which they might collapse, at the end of the day, 
and roll on the ground.Summarization models summary: 
The social worker who gave me a mug containing a hard, liquid and soft, sodden bread in which the hard, the liquid and the soft were joined, transferred it to me without my consent or understanding how it had been done.
I was shocked and distressed by the transfer and found myself in a situation where social workers offer free, gratis and for nothing, something to prevent swooning, which with them is an obsessioiv and they will pursue you to the ends of the earth.
The Salvation Army is no better than the social workers, and there is no defence against the charitable gesture.
In a panic, I threw the mug to the ground where it smashed to smithereens and I threw it far from me.

I have only to be told what good behaviour 
is and I am well-behaved, within the limits of my physical possi- 
bilities.And so I have never ceased to improve, from this point 
of view, for I — I used to be intelligent and quick.And as far as 
good-will is concerned, I had it to overflowing, the exasperated 
good-will of the over-anxious.So that my repertory of permitted 
attitudes has never ceased to grow, from my first steps until my 
last, executed last year.And if I have always behaved like a pig, 
the fault lies not with me but with my superiors, who corrected 
me only on points of detail instead of showing me the essence of 
the system, after the manner of the great English schools, and the 
guiding principles of good manners, and how to proceed, without 
> going wrong, from the former to the latter, and how to trace back 
to its ultimate source a given comportment.For that would have 
allowed me, before parading in public certain habits such as the 
finger in the nose, the scratching of the balls, digital emunction and 
the peripatetic piss, to refer them to the first rules of a reasoned 
theory.On this subject I had only negative and empirical notions, 
which means that I was in the dark, most of the time, and all the more 
completely as a lifetime of observations had left me doubting the 
possibility of systematic decorum, even within a limited area.But 
it is only since 1 have ceased to live that I think of these things 
and the other things.

It is in the tranquillity of decomposition that 
I remember the long confused emotion which was my life, and that 
I judge it, as it is said that God will judge me, and with no less 
impertinence.To decompose is to live too, I know, I know, don’t 
torment me, but one sometimes forgets.And of that life too I shall 
tell you perhaps one day, the day I know that when I thought I 
knew I was merely existing and that passion without form or 
stations will have devoured me down to the rotting flesh itself and26

time.Cry out that the declining sun fell full on the white wall 
of the barracks.It was like being in China.A confused shadow 
was cast.It was I and my bicycle.I began to play, gesticulating, 
waving my hat, moving my bicycle to and fro before me, blowing 
the horn, watching the wall.They were watching me through the 
bars, I fClt their eyes upon me.The policeman on guard at the door 
told me to go away.He needn’t have, I was calm again.The 
shadow in the end is no better than the substance.I asked the man 
to help me, to have pity on me.He didn’t understand.I thought

didn’t understand, or didn’t want to reply, he didn’t reply, but went 
on his way without a word, witfiout a word for me I mean, for he 
spoke to his dog who listened attentively, cocking his ears.I got 
to my knees, no, that doesn’t work, I got up and watched the little 
procession recede.I heard the shepherd whistle, and I saw him 
flourishing his crook, and the dog bustling about the herd, which 
but for him would no doubt have fallen into the canal.All that 
through a glittering dust, and soon through that mist too which rises 
in me every day and veils the world from me and veils me from 
myself.The bleating grew faint, because the sheep were less 
anxious., or because they were further away, or because my hearing 
was worse than a moment before, which would surprise me, for my 
hearing is still very good, scarcely blunted coming up to dawn, and 
if I sometimes hear nothing for hours on end it is for reasons of 
which I know nothing, or because about me all goes really silent, 
from time to time, whereas for the righteous the tumult of the 
world never stops.Summarization models summary:

That then is how that second day began, unless 
it was the third, or the fourth, and it was a bad beginning, because 
it left me with persisting doubts, as to the destination of those sheep, 
among which there were lambs, and often wondering if they had 
safely reached some commonage or fallen, their skulls shattered, 
their thin legs crumpling, first to their knees, then over on their 
fleecy sides, under the pole-axe, though that is not the way they 
slaughter sheep, but with a knife, so that they bleed to death.But 
there is much to be said too for these little doubts.Good God, 
what a land of breeders, you see quadrupeds everywhere.And it’s 
not over yet, there are still horses and goats, to mention only them, 
I feel them watching out for me, to get in my path.I have no need 
of that.But I did not lose sight of my immediate goal, which was30
SAMUEL BECKETT
to get to my mother as quickly as possible, and standing in the 
ditch I summoned to my aid the good reasons I had for going 
there, without a moment’s delay.And though there were many 
things I could do without thinking, not knowing what I was going 
to do until it was done, and not even then, going to my mother 
was not one of them.My feet, you see, never took me to my mother 
unless they received a definite order to do so.The glorious, the 
truly glorious weather would have gladdened any other heart than 
mine.But I have no reason to be gladdened by the sun and I take 
good care not to be.

The Aegean, 'thirsting for heat and light, him 
I killed, he killed himself, early on, in me.The pale gloom of rainy 
days was better fitted to my taste, no, that’s not it, to my humour, 
no, that’s not it either, I had-neither taste nor humour, I lost them 
early on.Perhaps what I mean is that the pale gloom, etc., hid me 
better, without its being on that account particularly pleasing to 
me.Chameleon in spite of himself, there you have Molloy, viewed 
from a certain angle.And in winter, under my greatcoat, I wrapped 
myself in swathes of newspaper, and did not shed them until the 
earth awoke, for good, in April.The Times Literary Supplement 
was admirably adapted to this purpose, of a never failing toughness 
and impermeability.Even farts made no impression on it.I can’t 
help it, gas escapes from my fundament on the least pretext, it’s 
hard not to mention it now and then, however great my distaste.One day I counted them.Three hundred and fifteen farts in nine- 
teen hours, or an average of over sixteen farts an hour.After all 
it’s not excessive.Four farts every fifteen minutes.It’s nothing.Not even one fart every four minutes.It’s unbelievable.Damn it, 
I hardly fart at all, I should never have mentioned it.Extraordinary 
how mathematics help you to know yourself.In any case this whole 
question of climate left me cold, I could stomach any mess.Summarization models summary:

So I 
will only add that the mornings were often sunny, in that part of 
the world, until ten o’clock or coming up to eleven, and that then 
the sky darkened and the rain fell, fell till evening.Then the sun 
came out and went down, the drenched earth sparkled an instant,

road.All roads were right for me, a wrong road was an event, for 
me.But when I was on my way to my mother only one road was 
right, the one that led to her, or one of those that led to her, for 
all did not lead to her.I did not know if I was on one of those right 
roads and that disturbed me, like all recall to life.Judge then of 
my relief when I saw, ahead of me, the familiar ramparts loom.I 
passed beyond them, into a district I did not know.And yet I knew 
the town well, for I was born there and had never succeeded in 
putting between it and me more than ten or fifteen miles, such was 
its grasp on me, I don’t know why.So that I came near to wonder- 
ing if I was in the right town, where I first saw the murk of day 
and which still harboured my mother, somewhere or other, or if I 
had not stumbled, as a result of a wrong turn, on a town whose very 
name I did not know.

For my native town was the only one I knew, 
having never set foot in any other.But I had read with care, while 
I still could read, accounts of travellers more fortunate than myself, 
telling of other towns as beautiful as mine, and even more beautiful, 
though with a different beauty.And now it was a name I sought, 
in my memory, the name of the only town it had been given me to 
know, with the intention, as soon as I had found it, of stopping, and 
saying to a passer-by, doffing my hat, I beg your pardon.Sir, this is 
X, is it not?X being the name of my town.And this name that I 
sought, I felt sure that it began with a B or with a P, but in spite of 
this clue, or perhaps because of its falsity, the other letters continued 
to escape me.I had been living so far from words so long, you 
understand, that it was enough for me to see my town, since we’re 
talking of my town, to be unable, you understand.It’s too difficult 
to say, for me.And even my sense of identity was wrapped in a 
namelessness often hard to penetrate, as we have just seen I think.And so on for all the other things which made merry with my senses.Yes, even then, when already all was fading, waves and particles, 
there could be no things but nameless things, no names but thing- 
less names.I say that now, but after all what do I know now about 
then, now when the icy words hail down upon me, the icy meanings, 
and the world dies too, foully named.Summarization models summary:

and the long sonata of the dead.And truly it little matters what I 
say, this or that or any other thing.Saying is inventing.Wrong, 
very rightly wrong.You invent nothing, you think you are invent- 
ing, you think you are escaping, and all you do is stammer out your 
lesson, the remnants of a pensum one day got by heart and long 
forgotten, life without tears, as it is wept.To hell with it anyway.Where was I.Unable to remember the name of my town I resolved 
to stop by the kerb, to wait for a passer-by with a friendly and 
intelligent air and then to whip off my hat and say, with my smile, 
I beg your pardon Sir, excuse me Sir, what is the name of this town, 
if you please?For the word once let fall I would know if it was 
the right word, the one I was seeking, in my memory, or another, 
and so where I stood.This resolution, actually formed as I rode 
along, was never to be carried out, an absurd mishap prevented it.Yes, my resolutions were remarkable in this, that they were no 
sooner formed than something always happened to prevent their 
execution.That must be why I am even less resolute now than then, 
just as then I was even less so than I once had been.But to tell 
the truth (to tell the truth ! )

I have never been particularly resolute, 
I mean given to resolutions, but rather inclined to plunge headlong, 
into the shit, without knowing who was shitting against whom or 
on which side 1 had the better chance of skulking with success.But from this leaning too I derived scant satisfaction and if I have 
never quite got rid of it it is not for want of trying.The fact is, it 
seems, that the most you can hope is to be a little less, in the end, 
the creature you were in the beginning, and the middle.For I had 
hardly perfected my plan, in my head, when my bicycle ran over 
a dog, as subsequently appeared, and fell to the ground, an inept- 
ness all the more unpardonable as the dog, duly leashed, was not 
out on the road, but in on the pavement, docile at its mistress’s 
heels.Precautions are like resolutions, to be taken with precaution.The lady must have thought she had left nothing to chance, so far 
as the safety of her dog was concerned, whereas in reality she was 
setting the whole system of nature at naught, no less surely than I 
myself with my insane demands for more light.But instead of 
grovelling in my turn, invoking my great age and infirmities, I 
made things worse by trying to run away.I was soon overtaken.MOLLOY

by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and all ages, for I caught a 
glimpse of white beards and little, almost angel faces, and they

He has killed Teddy, I grant you that, 
Teddy whom I loved like my own child, but it is not so serious as 
it seems, for as it happens I was taking him to the veterinary sur- 
geon, to have him put out of his misery.For Teddy was old, blind, 
deaf, crippled with rheumatism and perpetually incontinent, night 
and day, indoors and out of dtfors.Thanks then to this poor old 
man I have been spared a painful task, not to mention the expense 
which I am ill able to afford, having no other means of support 
than the pension of my dear departed, fallen in defence of a country 
that called itself his and from which in his lifetime he never derived 
the smallest benefit, but only insults and vexations.The crowd was 
beginning to disperse, the danger was past, but the lady was in her 
stride.You may say, she said, that he did wrong to run away, that 
he should have explained, asked to be forgiven.Granted.But it is 
clear he has not all his wits about him, that he is beside himself, 
for reasons of which we know nothing and which might put us all 
to shame, if we did know them.I even wonder if he knows what he 
has done.There emanated such tedium from this droning voice 
that I was making ready to move on when the unavoidable police 
constable rose up before me.He brought down heavily on my 
handle-bars his big red hairy paw, I noticed it myself, and had it 
appears with the lady the following conversation.Is this the man 
who ran over your dog.Madam?He is, sergeant, and what of it?No, I can’t record this fatuous colloquy.

So I will merely observe 
that finally in his turn the constable too dispersed, the word is not 
too strong, grumbling and growling, followed by the last idlers who 
had given up all hope of my coming to a bad end.But he turned back 
and said.Remove that dog.Free at last to go I began to do so.But 
the lady, a Mrs. Loy, I might as well say it now and be done with it, 
or Lousse, I forget, Christian name something like Sophie, held me 
back, by the tail of my coat, and said, assuming the words were 
the same when I heard them as when first spoken.Sir, I need you.And seeing I suppose from my expressiftn, which frequently betrays34

me, that she had made herself understood, she must have said.If 
he understands that he can understand anything.And she was not 
mistaken, for after some time I found myself in possession of certain 
ideas or points of view which could only have come to me from 
her, namely that having killed her dog I was morally obliged to 
help her carry it home and bury it, that she did not wish to prose- 
cute me for what I had done, but that it was not always possible 
to do as one did not wish, that she found me likeable enough in 
spite of my hideous appearance and would be happy to hold out 
to me a helping hand, and so on,’ I’ve forgotten the half of it.Ah 
yes, I too needed her, it seemed.She needed me to help her get rid 
of her dog, and I needed her.I’ve forgotten for what.Summarization models summary:

over in silence as I had the rest, and I made no bones about telling 
her I needed neither her nor anyone else, which was perhaps a 
slight exaggeration, for I must have needed my mother, otherwise 
why this frenzy of wanting to get to her?That is one of the many

say either too much or too little, which is a terrible thing for a man 
with a passion for truth like mine.And I shall not abandon this 
subject, to which I shall probably never have occasion to return, 
with such a storm blowing up, without making this curious obser- 
vation, that it often happened to me, before I gave up speaking for 
good, to think I had said too little when in fact I had said too 
much and in fact to have said too little when I thought 
I had said too much.I mean that on reflection, in the long run 
rather, my verbal profusion turned out to be penury, and inversely.So time sometimes turns the tables.In other words, or perhaps 
another thing, whatever I said it was never enough and always too 
much.Yes, I was never silent, whatever I said I was never silent.Divine analysis that conduces thus to knowledge of yourself, and 
of your fellow-men, if you happen to have any.For to say I needed 
no one was not to say too much, but an infinitesimal part of what 
I should have said, could not have said, should never have said.Need of my mother !No, there were no words tar the want of need

when I tried to sit down, as if my $ick leg was not enough, and when 
I rode my bicycle they bounced up and down.So the best thing for

it with anguished hand.They had shaved me, they had shorn me of 
my scant beard.How had my sleep withstood such liberties?My 
sleep as a rule so uneasy.To this question I found a number of 
replies.But I did not know which of them was right.Perhaps 
they were all wrong.My beard grows properly only on my chin

It is in any case a 
place devoid of mystery, deserted by magic, because devoid of 
mystery.And if I do not go there gladly, I go perhaps more gladly 
there than anywhere else, astonished and at peace, I nearly said 
as in a dream, but no, no.But it is not the kind of place where you 
go, but where you find yourself, sometimes, not knowing how, and 
which you cannot leave at will, and where you find yourself without 
any pleasure, but with more perhaps than in those places you can 
escape from, by making 'an effort, places full of mystery, full of 
the familiar mysteries.I listen and the voice is of a world collapsing 
endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky, enough to 
see by, yes, and frozen too.And I hear it murmur that all wilts 
and yields, as if loaded down, but here there are no loads, and the 
ground too, unfit for loads, and the light too, down towards an 
end it seems can never come.For what possible end to these wastes 
where true light never was, nor any upright thing, nor any trufe 
foundation, but only these leaning things, forever lapsing and 
crumbling away, beneath a sky without memory of morning or hope 
of night.These things, what things, come from where, made of 
what?And it says that here nothing stirs, has never stirred, will 
never stir, except myself, who do not stir either, when I am there, 
but see and am seen.Yes, a world at an end, in spite of appearances, 
its end brought it forth, ending it began, is it clear enough?

And I 
too am at an end, when I am there, my eyes close, my sufferings 
cease and I end, I wither as the living can not.And if I went on 
listening to that far whisper, silent long since and which I still 
hear, I would learn still more, about this.But I will listen no longer, 
for the time being, to that far whisper, for I do not like it, I fear it.But it is not a sound like the other sounds, that you listen to, 
when you choose, and can sometimes silence, by going away or 
stopping your ears, no, but it is a sound which begins to rustle in 
your head, without your«knowing how, or why.It’s with your head 
you hear it, not your ears, you can’t stop it.but it stops itself, whenMOLLOY

it chooses.It makes no difference therefore whether I listen to it 
or not I shall hear it always, no thunder can deliver me, until it 
stops.But nothing compels me to speak of it, when it doesn’t suit 
me.And it doesn’t suit me, at the moment.No, what suits me, at 
the moment, is to be done with this business of the moon which 
was left unfinished, by me, for me.And if I get done with it less 
successfully than if I had all my wits about me, I shall none the less 
get done with it, as best I can, at least I think so.That moon then, 
all things considered, filled me suddenly with amaze, with surprise, 
perhaps better.Summarization models summary:

this moon which had just sailed gallant and full past my window 
had appeared to me the night before, or the night before that, yes, 
more likely, all young and slender, on her back, a shaving.And 
then I had said.Now I see, he has waited for the new moon before 
launching forth on unknown ways, leading south.And then a little 
later.Perhaps I should go to mother tomorrow.For all things hang

if I failed to mention this detail in its proper place, it is because you 
cannot mention everything in its proper place, you must choose,

SAMUEL BECKETT
I saw A and C and then made up my mind to go and see my mother, 
and this other night, more time than I had thought, namely fourteen 
full days, or nearly?And if so, what had happened to those fourteen 
days, or nearly, and where had they flown?And what possible 
chance was there of finding a place for them, no matter what their 
burden, in the so rigorous chain of events I had just undergone?Was it not wiser to suppose either that the moon seen two 
nights before, far from being new as I had thought, was on the 
eve of being full, or else that, the moon seen from Lousse’s 
house, far from being full, as it had appeared to me, was in fact 
merely entering on its first quarter, or else finally that here I had 
to do with two moons, as far from the new as from the full and so 
alike in outline that the nalced eye could hardly tell between them, 
and that whatever was at variance with these hypotheses was so

The moon which sailed gallant and full past my window the previous night had appeared to me the night before, possibly young and slender, with a young, slender woman on her back, possibly with a shaving.
This moon had been waiting for the new moon before launching off on unknown ways, leading south.
The moon seen from Lousse’s house was not new and was on the first quarter of its first quarter.
I saw A and C and then made up my mind to go and see my mother the following night.
There were 14 full days between the previous moon and the one seen from the house.
During this time, SamuEL BECKETT saw two moon-like outlines of two moons, as far from each other as they were in outline.

me back to other nights, other moons, this moon I had just seen, 
I had forgotten who I was (excusably) and spoken of myself as I 
would have of another, if I had been compelled to speak of another.Yes it sometimes happens and will sometimes happen again that I 
forget who I am and strut before my eyes, like a stranger.Then I 
see the sky different from what it is and the earth too takes on false

misery to go.The next day I demanded my clothes.The valet went 
to find out.He came back with the news they had been burnt.I 
continued my inspection of the room.It was at first sight a perfect 
cube.Through the lofty window I saw boughs.They rocked gently,

alone again, leaving the door open.Through the door I saw a big 
window, bigger than the door which it overlapped entirely, and 
opaque.

The valet came back with the news my clothes had been 
sent to the dyers, to have the shine taken off.He held my crutches, 
which should have seemed strange to me, but seemed natural to 
me, on the contrary.I took hold of one and began to strike the 
pieces of furniture with it, not very hard, just hard enough to over- 
turn them, without breaking them.They were fewer than in the 
night.To tell the truth I pushed them rather than struck them, I 
thrust at them, I lunged, and that is not pushing either, but it’s 
more like pushing than striking.But recalling who I was I soon 
threw away my crutch and came to a standstill in the middle of the 
room, determined to stop asking for things, to stop pretending to 
be angry.For to want my clothes, and I thought I wanted them, 
was no reason for pretending to be angry, when they were refused.And alone once more I resumed my inspection of the room and 
was on the point of endowing it with other properties when the 
valet came back with the news my clothes had been sent for and 
I would have them soon.Then he began to straighten the tables 
'and chairs I had overturned and to put them back into place, 
dusting them as he did so with a feather duster which suddenly 
appeared in his hand.And so I began to help him as best I could, 
by way of proving that I bore no grudge against anyone.Summarization models summary:

though I could not do much, because of my stiff leg, yet I did what 
I could, that is to say I took each object as he straightened it 
and proceeded with excruciating meticulousncss to restore it to its 
proper place, stepping back with raised arms the better to assess 
the result and then springing forward to effect minute improve- 
ments.And with the tail of my nightdress as with a duster I 
petulantly flicked them one by one.But of this little game too I 
soon wearied and suddenly stood stock still in the middle of the 
room.But seeing him ready to go I took a step forward and said.My bicycle.And I said it again, and again, the same words, until 
he appeared to understand.I don’t know to what race he belonged, 
he was so tiny and ageless, assuredly not to mine.He was an 
oriental perhaps, a vague oriental, a child of the Rising Sun.He 
wore white trousers, a white shirt and a yellow waistcoat, like a44

chamois he was, with brass buttons and sandals.It is not often that 
I take cognisance so clearly of the clothes that people wear and I 
am happy to give you the benefit of it.The reason for that was 
perhaps this, that all morning the talk had been of clothes, of mine.And perhaps I had been saying, to myself, words to this effect.Look at him, peaceful in his own clothes, and look at me, floating 
about inside another man’s nightdress, another woman's probably, 
for it was pink and transparent and adorned with ribands and frills 
and lape.

Whereas the room, I saw the room but darkly, at each 
fresh inspection it seemed changed, and that is known as seeing 
darkly, in the present state of our knowledge.The boughs them- 
selves seemed to shift, as though endowed with an orbital velocity 
of their own, and in the big frosted window the door was no longer 
inscribed, but had slightly shifted to the right, or to the left, I 
forget, so that there now appeared within its frame a panel of white 
wall, on which I succeeded in casting faint shadows when I moved.But that there were natural causes to all these things I am willing 
to concede, for the resources of nature are infinite apparently.It 
was I who was not natural enough to enter into that order of things, 
and appreciate its niceties.But I was used to seeing the sun rise in 
the south, used to not knowing where I was going, what I was 
leaving, what was going with me, all things turning and twisting 
confusedly about me.It is difficult, is it not, to go to one’s mother 
with things in such a state, more difficult than to the Lousses of 
this world, or to its police-stations, or to the other places that are 
waiting for me, I know.But the valet having brought my clothes, 
in a paper which he unwrapped in front of me, I saw that my hat 
was not among them, so that I said.My hat.And when he finally 
understood what I wanted he went away and came back a little 
later with my hat.Summarization models summary:

to submit him and myself to this fresh ordeal, when it could be 
avoided.These considerations crossed my mind with a certain 
rapidity.Now with regard to the pockets, four in all, of my clothes,I verified their contents in front of the valet and discovered that 
certain things were missing.My sucking-stone in particular was no 
longer there.But sucking-stones abound on our beaches, when you 
know where to look for them, and I deemed it wiser to say nothing 
about it, all the more so as he would have been capable, after an 
hour’s argument, of going and fetching me from the garden a com- 
pletely unsuckable stone.This was a decision too which I took 
almost instantaneously.But of the other objects which had dis- 
appeared why speak, since I did not know exactly what they were.And perhaps they had been taken from me at the police-station, 
without my knowing it, or scattered and lost, when I fell, or at some 
other time, or thrown away, for I would sometimes throw away 
all I had about me, in a burst of irritation.So why speak of them?

I resolved nevertheless to declare loudly that a knife was missing, 
a noble knife, and I did so to such effect that I soon received a 
very fine vegetable knife, so-called stainless, but it didn’t take me 
long to stain it, and which opened and shut into the bargain, unlike 
all the vegetable knives I had ever known, and which had a safety 
catch, highly dangerous as soon appeared and the cause of innum- 
erable cuts, all over my fingers caught between the handle of so- 
called genuine Irish horn and the blade red with rust and so blunted 
that it was less a matter of cuts than of contusions.And if I deal 
at such length with this knife it is because I have it somewhere 
still I think, among my possessions, and because having dealt with 
it here at such length I shall not have to deal with it again, when 
the moment comes, if it ever comes, to draw up the list of my pos- 
sessions, and that will be a relief, a welcome relief, when that 
moment, comes, I know.For it is natural I should dilate at lesser 
lengtii on what I lost than on what I could not lose, that goes 
without saying.And if I do not always appear to observe this 
principle it is because it escapes me.from time to time, and

But I pushed and pulled in vain, the wheels would not turn.It was as though the brakes were jammed, and heaven knows they 
were not, for my bicycle had ng brakes.And suddenly overcome 
by a great weariness, in spite of the dying day when I always felt 
most alive, I threw the bicycle back in the bush and lay down on 
the ground, on the grass, careless of the dew, I never feared the 
dew.It was then that Lousse, taking advantage of my weakness, 
squatted down beside me and began to make me propositions, to 
which I must confess I listened, absent-mindedly, I had nothing 
• else to do, I could do nothing else, and doubtless she had poisoned 
my beer with something intended to mollify me, to mollify Molloy, 
with the result that I was nothing more than a lump of melting 
wax, so to speak.And from these propositions, which she enun- 
ciated slowly and distinctly, repeating each clause several times, 
I finally elicited the following, or gist.I could not prevent her 
having a weakness for me, neither could she.I would live in her 
home, as though it were my own.I would have plenty to eat and 
drink, to smoke too if I smoked, for nothing, and my remaining 
days would glide away without a care.I would as it were take the 
place of the dog I had killed, as it for her had taken the place of 
a child.I would help in the garden, in the house, when I wished, 
if I wished.I would not go out on the street, for once out I would 
never find my way in again.

I would adopt the rhythm of life which 
best suited me, getting up, going to bed and taking my meals at 
whatsoever hours I pleased.If I did not choose to be clean, to wear 
nice clones, to wash and so on, I need not.She would be grieved, 
but what was her grief, compared to my grief?All she asked was 
to feel me near her, with her, and the right to contemplate from 
time to time this extraordinary body both at rest and in motion.Every now and then I interrupted her, tp ask what town I was in.But either because she did not understand me, or because she pre-48

ferred to leave me in ignorance, she did not reply to my question, 
but went on with her soliloquy, reiterating tirelessly each new propo- 
sition, then expounding further, slowly, gently, the benefits for 
both of us if I would make my home with her.Till nothing was 
left but this monotonous voice, in the deepening night and the smell 
of the damp earth and of a strongly scented flower which at the 
time I could not identify, but which later I identified as spike- 
lavender.There were beds of it everywhere, in this garden, for 
Lousse loved spike, she must have told me herself, otherwise I 
would not have known, she loved it above all other herbs and 
flowers, because of its smell, and then also because of its spikes, 
and its colour.And if I had not lost my sense of smell the smell 
of lavender would always make me think of Lousse, in accordance 
with the well-known mechanism of association.Summarization models summary:

me, whereas I was stretched out at my ease on the grass, now on 
my back, now on my stomach, now on one side, now on the other.And all the time she never stopped talking, whereas I only opened 
my mouth to ask, at long intervals, more and more feebly, what 
town we were in.And sure of her victory at last, or simply feeling 
she had done all she could and that further insistence was useless, 
she got up and went away, I don’t know where, for I stayed where 
I was, with regret, mild regret.For in me there have always been 
two fools, among others, one asking nothing better than to stay 
where he is and the other imagining that life might be slightly less

not in other places, where there is less constraint, and as it does 
not during the day, when there is more vigilance, and then some- 
thing else that is not clear, being neither the air nor what it moves, 
perhaps the far unchanging noise the earth makes and which other 
noises cover, but not for long.For they do not account for that 
noise you hear when you really listen, when all seems hushed.And 
there was another noise, that of my life become the life of this 
garden as it rode the earth of deeps and wildernesses.Yes, there 
were times when I forgot not only who I was, but that I was, 
forgot to be.Then I was no longer that sealed jar to which I owed 
my being so well preserved, but a wall gave way and I filled with 
roots and tame stems for example, stakes long since dead and 
ready for burning, the recess of night and the imminence of dawn, 
and then the labour of the planet rolling eager into winter, winter 
would rid it of these contemptible scabs.Or of that winter I was 
the precarious calm, the thaw of the snows which make no differ-

happen to me often, mostly I stayed in my jar which knew neither

to be careful, ask yourself questions, as for example whether you 
still are, and if no when it stopped, and if yes how long it will still go

that I might believe I was still there And yet it meant nothing to 
me to be still there.I called that thinking.I thought almost without

quite a sensitive ear, and sounds unencumbered with precise mean- 
ing were registered perhaps better by me than by most.What was 
it then?

A defect of the understanding perhaps, which only began 
to vibrate on repeated solicitations, or which did vibrate, if you like, 
but at a lower frequency, or a higher, than that of ratiocination, if 
such a thing is conceivable, and such a thing is conceivable, since 
I conceive it.Yes, the words I heard, and heard distinctly, having 
quite a sensitive ear, were heard a first time, then a second, and 
often even a third, as pure sounds, free of all meaning, and this 
is probably one of the reasons why conversation was unspeakably 
painful to me.And the words I uttered myself, and which must 
nearly always have gone with an effort of the intelligence, were 
often to me as the buzzing of an insect.And this is perhaps one 
of the reasons I was so untalkative, I mean this trouble I had in 
understanding not only what others said to me, but also what I 
said to them.It is true that in the end, by dint of patience, we made 
ourselves understood, but understood with regard to what, I ask of 
you, and to what purpose?And to the noises of nature too, and of 
the works of men, I reacted I think in my own way and without 
desire of enlightenment.And my eye too, the seeing one, must 
have been ill-connected with the spider, for I found it hard to 
name what was mirrored there, often quite distinctly.And without 
going so far as to say that I saw the world upside down (that would 
have been too easy) it is certain I saw it in a way inordinately 
formal, though I was far from being an aesthete, or an artist.Summarization models summary:

This is what is called the "dreamer's eye". The process described by Samuel works not just in dreams, but in everyday life, such as when you are working on a project where you may feel uncomfortable. In such cases, you might see somebody else, but you may feel unable to recognize them. To get out of that situation, it means that you must try different ways to help the feeling, which sometimes makes them difficult to read as well. Sometimes, in our own household

of my two eyes only one functioning more or less correctly, I mis- 
judged the distance separating me from the other world, and often 
I stretched out my hand for what was far beyond my reach, and 
often I knocked against obstacles scarcely visible on the horizon.But I was like that even when I had my two eyes, it seems to me, 
but perhaps not, for it is long since that era of my life, and my recol- 
lection of it is more than imperfect.And now I come to think of it, 
my attempts at taste and smell were scarcely more fortunate, I smelt 
and tasted without knowing exactly what, nor whether it was good, 
nor whether it was bad, and seldom twice running the same thing.I would have been I think an excellent husband, incapable of

mindedness.Now as to telling you why I stayed a good while with 
Lousse, no, I cannot.That is to say I could I suppose, if I took the 
trouble.But why should I?In order to establish beyond all question 
that I could not do otherwise?For that is the conclusion I would 
come to, fatally.I who had loved the image of old Geulincx, dead 
young, who left me free, on the black boat of Ulysses, to crawl 
towards the East, along the deck.That is a great measure of free- 
dom, for him who has not the pioneering spirit.And from the poop, 
poring upon the wave, a sadly rejoicing slave, I follow with my 
eyes the proud and futile wake.Which, as it bears me from no 
fatherland away, bears me onward to no shipwreck.A good while 
then with Lousse.

It’s vague, a good while, a few months perhaps, 
a year perhaps.I know it was warm again the day I left, but that 
meant nothing, in my part of the world, where it seemed to be 
warm or cold or merely mild at any moment of the year and where 
the days did not run gently up and down, no, not gently.Perhaps 
things have changed since.So all I know is that it was much the 
same weather when I left as when I came, so far as I was capable 
of knowing what the weather was.And I had been under the 
weather so long, under all weathers, that I could tell quite well 
between them, my body could tell between them and seemed even to 
have its likes, its dislikes.I think I stayed in several rooms one 
after the other, or alternately, I don’t know.In my head there are 
several windows, that I do know, but perhaps it is always the same 
one, open variously on the parading universe.The house was fixed, 
that is perhaps what I mean by these different rooms.House and 
garden were fixed, thanks to some unknown mechanism of com- 
pensation, and I, when I stayed still, as I did most of the time, was 
fixed too, and when I moved, from place to place, it was very 
slowly, as in a cage out of time, as the saying is, in the jargon of 
the schools, and out of space too to be sure.For to be out of one 
and not out of the other was for cleverer than me, who was not 
clever, but foolish.But I may be quite wrong.Summarization models summary:

at the things they framed.But I will not dwell on this episode, so 
ludicrously brief when you think of it and so poor in substance.For 
I helped neither in the house nor the garden and knew nothing of 
what work was going forward, day and night, nothing save the 
sounds that came to me, dull sounds and sharp ones too, and 
then often the roar of air being vigorously churned, it seemed to 
me, and which perhaps was nothing more than the sound of burn- 
ing.I preferred the garden to the house, to judge by the long hours 
I spent there, for I spent there the; greater part of the day and of 
the night,' whether it was wet or whether it was fine.Men were 
always busy there, working at I know not what.For the garden 
seemed hardly to change, from day to day, apart from the tiny 
changes due to the customary cycle of birth, life and death.And 
in the midst of those men I drifted like a dead leaf on springs, or 
else I lay down on the ground, and then they stepped gingerly over 
me as though I had been a bed of rare flowers.Yes, it was doubtless 
in order to preserve the garden from apparent change that they 
laboured at it thus.My bicycle had disappeared again.

Sometimes 
I felt the wish to look for it again, to find it again and find out 
what was wrong with it or even go for a little ride on the walks 
and paths connecting the different parts of the garden.But instead 
of trying to satisfy this wish I stayed where I was looking at it, if 
I may say so, looking at it as it shrivelled up and finally disap- 
peared, like the famous fatal skin, only much quicker.For there 
seem to be two ways of behaving in the presence of wishes, the 
active and the contemplative, and though they both give the same 
result it was the latter I preferred, matter of temperament I pre- 
sume.The garden was surrounded with a high wall, its top bristling 
with broken glass like fins.But what must have been absolutely 
unexpected was this, that this wall was broken by a wicket-gate 
giving free access to the road, for it was never locked, of that I was 
all but convinced, having opened and closed it without the least 
trouble on more than one occasion, both by day and by night, and 
seen it used by others than myself, for the purpose as well of en- 
trance as of exit.I would stick out my nose, then hastily call it 
in again.A few further rerqprks.Never did I see a woman within

self I saw but little, she seldom showed herself to me, out of tact 
perhaps, fearing to alarm me.But I think she spied on me a great 
deal, hiding behind the bushes, or the curtains, or skulking in the 
shadows of a first-floor room, with a spy-glass perhaps.For had 
she not said she desired above all to see me, both coming and going 
and rooted to the spot.And t<* get a good view you need the key- 
hole, the little chink among the leaves, and so on, whatever prevents 
you from being seen and from seeing more than a little at a time.No?I don’t know.Yes, she inspected me, little by little, and even 
in my very going to bed, my sleeping and my getting up, the 
mornings that I went to bed.For in this matter I remained faithful 
to my custom, which was to sleep in the morning, when I slept at 
all.For it sometimes happened that I did not sleep at all, for 
several days, without feeling at all the worse for it.For my waking 
was a kind of sleeping.And I did not always sleep in the same 
place, but now I slept in the garden, which was large, and now I 
slept in the house, which was large too, really extremely spacious.And this uncertainty as to the hour and place of my sleeping must 
have entranced her, I imagine, and made the time pass pleasantly.But it is useless to dwell on this period of my life.If I go on long 
enough calling that my life I’ll end up by believing it.It’s the prin- 
ciple of advertising.This period of my life.

It reminds me, when I 
think of it, of air in a water-pipe.So I will only add that this woman 
went on giving me slow poison, slipping I know not what poisons 
into the drink she gave me, or into the food she gave me, or both, 
or one day one, the next the other.That is a grave charge to bring 
and I do not bring it lightly.And I bring it without ill-feeling, yes, 
I accuse her without ill-feeling of having drugged my food and 
drink with noxious and insipid powders and potions.But even 
sipid they would have made no difference, I would have swallowed 
it all down with the same whole-heartedness.That celebrated whiff 
of almonds for example would never have taken away my appetite.My appetite!What a subject.For conversation.I had hardly any.I ate like a thrush.But the little I did eat I devoured with a voracity54

as a rule eat ponderously and with method, that follows from the 
very notion of heavy eating.Whereas I flung myself at the mess, 
gulped down the half or the quarter of it in two mouthfuls without 
chewing (with what would I have chewed?), then pushed it from 
me with loathing.One would have thought I ate to live!Similarly 
I would engulf five or six mugs of beer with one swig, then drink

Now as to the substances she 
insinuated thus into my various systems, I could not say whether 
they were stimulants or whether they were not rather depressants.The truth is, cocnaesthetically speaking of course, I felt more or less 
the same as usual, that is to say, if I may give myself away, so 
terror-stricken that I was virtually bereft of feeling, not to say of 
consciousness, and drowned in a deep and merciful torpor shot with 
brief abominable gleams, I give you my word.Against such har- 
mony of what avail the miserable molys of Loussc, administered 
in infinitesimal doses probably, to draw the pleasure out.Not that 
they remained entirely without cllcct, no, that would be an exag- 
geration.For from time to time I caught myself making a little 
bound in the air, two or three feet off the ground at least, I who 
never bounded.It looked like levitation.And it happened too, less 
surprisingly, when I was walking, or even propped up against some- 
thing, that I suddenly collapsed, like a puppet when its strings are 
dropped, and lay long where I fell, literally boneless.Yes, that 
struck me as less strange, for I was used to collapsing thus, but 
with this difference, that I felt it coming, and prepared myself 
accordingly, as an epileptic docs when he feels the fit coming.I 
mean that knowing I was going to fall I lay down, or I wedged 
myself where I stood so firmly that nothing short of an earthquake 
could have dislodged me, and I waited.

But these were precautions 
I did not always take, preferring the fall to the trouble of having to 
lie down or stand fast.Whereas the falls I suffered when with 
Loussc did not give me a chance to circumvent them.But all the 
same they surprised me less, they were more in keeping with me, 
than the little bounds.For even as a child I do not remember ever 
having bounded, neither rage nor pain ever made me bound, evenMOLLOY

as a child, however ill-qualified I am to speak of that time.Now 
with regard to my food, it seems to me I ate it as, when and where it 
best suited me.I never had to call for it.It was brought to me, 
wherever I happened to be, on a tray.I can still see the tray, 
almost at will, it was round, with a low rim, to keep the things 
from falling off, and coated with red lacquer, cracking here and 
there.It was small too, as became a tray having to hold a single 
dish and one slab of bread.For the little I ate I crammed into 
my mouth with my hands, and the bottles I drank from the bottle 
were brought to me separately, in a basket.But this basket made 
no impression on me, good or bad, and I could not tell you what 
it was like.And many a time, having strayed for one reason or 
another from the place where the meal had been brought to me, 
I couldn’t find it again, when I felt the desire to eat.Then I searched 
high and low, often with success, being fairly familiar with the 
places where it was likely to have been, but often too, in vain.Summarization models summary:

Or I did not search at all, preferring hunger and thirst to the trouble 
of having to search without being sure of finding, or of having to 
ask for another tray to be brought, and another basket, or the same, 
to the place where I was.It was then I regretted my sucking-stone.And when I talk of preferring, for example, or regretting, it must 
not be supposed that I opted for the least evil, and adopted it, 
for that would be wronc.But not knowing exactly what I was 
doing or avoiding, I did it and avoided it all unsuspecting that one 
day, much later, I would have to go back over all these acts and 
omissions, dimmed and mellowed by age, and drag them into the 
eudcmonistic slop.But I must say that with Lousse my health got 
no worse, or scarcely.By which I mean that what was already 
wrong with me got worse and worse, little by little, as was only 
to be expected.But there was kind'ed no new seat of suffering or 
infection, except of course those arising from the spread of existing 
plethoras and deficiencies.But I may very well be wrong.For of 
the disorders to come, as for example the loss of the toes of my 
left foot, no, I am wrong, my right foot, who can say exactly when 
on my helpless clay the fatal seeds were sown.So all I can say, and I 
do my best to say no more, is that during my stay with Lousse no 
more new symptoms appeared, of a pathological nature, I mean56

nothing new or strange, nothing I could not have foreseen if I could 
have, nothing at all comparable to the sudden loss of half my toes.

For that is something I could never have foreseen and the meaning 
of which I have never fathomed, I mean its connection with my 
other discomforts, from my ignorance of medical matters.I sup- 
pose.For all things run together, in the body’s long madness, I 
feel it.But it is useless to drag out this chapter of my, how shall 
I say, my existence, for it has no sense, to my mind.It is a dug 
at which I tug in vain, it yields nothing but wind and spatter.So 
I will confine myself to the following brief additional remarks, and 
the first of which is this, that Lousse was a woman of extraor- 
dinary flatness, physically speaking of course, to such a point that 
I am still wondering this evening, in the comparative silence of 
my last abode, if she was not a man rather or at least an androgyne.She had a somewhat hairy face, or am I imagining it, in the in- 
terests of the narrative?The poor woman, I saw her so little, so 
little looked at her.And was not her voice suspiciously deep?So 
she appears to me today.Don’t be tormenting yourself, Molloy, 
man or woman, what does it matter?But I cannot help asking 
myself the following question.Could a woman have stopped me 
as I swept towards mother?Probably.Better still, was such an 
encounter possible, I mean between me and a woman?Now men, 
I have rubbed up against a few men in my time, but women?Oh well, I may as well confess it now, yes, I once rubbed up 
against one.Summarization models summary:

love, for she had told me so.She bent over the couch, because of 
her rheumatism, and in I went from behind.It was the only position 
she could bear, because of her lumbago.It seemed all right to me, 
for I had seen dogs, and I was astonished when she confided that 
you could go about it differently.I wonder what she meant exactly.Perhaps after all she put me in her rectum.A matter of complete 
indifference to me, I needn’t tell you.But is it true love, in the 
rectum?That’s what bothers me sometimes.Have I never known 
true love, after all?

She too was an eminently flat woman and she 
moved with short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick.Perhaps 
she too was a man, yet another of them.But in that case surely 
our testicles would have collided, while we writhed.Perhaps she 
held hers tight in her hand, on purpose to avoid it.She favoured 
voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and other undergar- 
ments whose names I forget.They welled up all frothing and swish- 
ing and then, congress achieved, broke over us in slow cascades.And all I could see was her taut yellow nape which every now 
and then I set my teeth in, forgetting I had none, such is the power 
of instinct.We met in a rubbish dump, unlike any other, and yet 
they are all alike, rubbish dumps.I don’t know what she was doing 
there.I was limply poking about in the garbage saying probably, 
for at that age I must still have been capable of general ideas.This 
is life.She had no time to lose, I had nothing to lose, I would have 
made love with a goat, to know what love was.She had a dainty 
flat, no, not dainty, it made you want to lie down in a corner and 
never get up again.I liked it.It was full of dainty furniture, under 
our desperate strokes the couch moved forward on its castors, the 
whole place fell about our ears, it was pandemonium.Our com- 
merce was not without tenderness, with trembling hands she cut 
my toe-nails and I rubbed her rump with winter cream.This idyll 
was of short duration.Poor Edith, I hastened her end perhaps.Summarization models summary:

know love, and probe it to the bottom, without charge.But she 
was an idealist.I would have preferred it seems to me an orifice 
less arid and roomy, that would have given me a higher opinion 
of love it seems to me.However.Twixt finger and thumb ’tis heaven 
in comparison.But love is no doubt above such base contingencies.And not when you are comfortable, but when your frantic member 
casts about for a rubbing-place, and the unction of a little mucous 
membrane, and meeting with none does not beat in retreat, but re- 
tains its tumefaction, it is then no dqubt that true love comes to pass, 
and wings away, high above the tight fit and the loose.And when 
you add a little pedicure and massage, having nothing to do with 
the instant of bliss strictly speaking, then I feel no further doubt 
is justified, in this connection?The other thing that bothers me, in 
this connection, is the indifference with which I learnt of her death, 
one black night I was crawling towards her, an indifference softened 
indeed by the pain of losing a source of revenue.She died taking a 
warm tub, as her custom was before receiving me.It limbered her 
up.

When I think she might have expired in my arms!The tub 
overturned and the dirty water spilt all over the floor and down 
on top of the lodger below, who gave the alarm.Well, well, I 
didn’t think I knew this story so well.She must have been a woman 
after all, if she hadn’t been it would have got around in the neigh- 
bourhood.It is true they were extraordinarily reserved, in my part 
of the world, about everything connected with sexual matters.But 
things have perhaps changed since my time.And it is quite 
possible that the fact of having found a man when they should 
have found a woman was immediately repressed and forgotten, 
by the few unfortunate enough to know about it.As it is quite 
possible that everybody knew about it, and spoke about it, with 
the sole exception of myself.But there is one thing that tor- 
ments me, when I delve into all this, and that is to know whether 
all my life has been devoid of love or whether I really met with it, 
in Ruth.What I do know for certain is that I never sought to 
repeat the experience, having I suppose the intuition that it had 
been unique and perfect, of its kind, achieved and inimitable, and 
that it behoved me to preserve its memory, pure of all pastiche,

to demonstrate that the fact of having met Lousse and even fre- 
quented her, in a way, proved nothing as to her sex.And I am 
quite willing to go on thinking of her as an old woman, widowed 
and withered, and of Ruth as another, for she too used to speak 
of her defunct husband and of his inability to satisfy her legitimate 
cravings.And there arc days, like this evening, when my memory 
confuses them and I am tempted to think of them as one and the 
same old hag, flattened and crazed by life.And God forgive me 
to tell you the horrible truth, my mother’s image sometimes mingles 
with theirs, which is literally unendurable, like being crucified, I 
don’t know why and I don’t want to.But I left Lousse at last, one 
warm airless night, without saying goodbye, as I might at least 
have done, and without her trying to hold me back, except perhaps 
by spells.But she must have seen me go, get up, take my crutches 
and go away, springing on them through the air.And she must 
have seen the wicket close behind me, for it closed by itself, with 
the help of a spring, and known me gone, for ever.For she knew 
the way I had of going to the wicket and peeping out, then quickly 
drawing back.

And she did not try and hold me back but she went 
and sat down on her dog's grave, perhaps, which was mine too in 
a way, and which by the way she had not sown with grass, as I 
had thought, but with all kinds of little many-coloured flowers and 
herbaceous plants, selected I imagine in such a way that when some 
went out others lit up.I left her my bicycle which I had taken a 
dislike to, suspecting it to be the vehicle of some malignant agency 
and perhaps the cause of my recent misfortunes.But all the same 
I would have taken it with me if I had known where it was and that 
it was m running order.But I did not.And I was afraid, if I tried 
to find out, of wearing out the small voice saying.Get out of here, 
Molloy, take your crutches and get out of here, and which I had 
taken so long to understand, for I had been hearing it for a long 
time.And perhaps I understood it al^ wrong, but I understood it

winding ways, to the place I was leaving.And perhaps my course 
it not yet fully run.Outside in the road the wind was blowing, it 
was another world.Not knowing where I was nor consequently 
what way I ought to go I went with the wind.And when, well

don’t come talking at me of the stars, they look all the same to me, 
yes, I cannot read the stars, in spite of my astronomical studies.But I entered the first shelter I came to and stayed there till dawn, 
for I knew I was bound to be stopped by the first policeman and 
asked what I was doing, a question to which I have never been 
able to find the correct reply.But it cannot have been a real shelter 
and I did not stay till dawn, for a man came in soon after me and 
drove me out.And yet there was room for two.I think he was a 
kind of nightwatchman, a man of some kind certainly, he must have 
been employed to watch over some kind of public works, digging 
I suppose.I see a brazier.There must have been a touch of autumn 
in the air, as the saying is.I therefore moved on and ensconced 
myself on a flight of stairs, in a mean lodging-house, because there 
was no door or it didn’t shut, I don’t know.Long before dawn 
this lodging-house began to empty.People came down the stairs, 
men and women.I glued myself against the wall.They paid no 
heed to me, nobody interfered with me.In the end I too went away, 
when I deemed it prudent, and wandered about the town in search 
of a familiar monument, so that I might say, I am in my town, 
after all, I have been there all the time.The town was waking, 
doors opening and shutting, soon the noise would be deafening.But espying a narrow alley between two high buildings I looked 
about me, then slipped into it.

Little windows overlooked it, on 
either side, on every floor, facing one another.Lavatory lights I 
suppose.There are things from time to time, in spite of everything, 
that impose themselves on the understanding with the force of 
axioms, for unknown reasons.There was no way out of the alley, 
it was not so much an alley as a blind alley.At the end there were 
two recesses, no, that’s not,the word, opposite each other, littered 
with miscellaneous rubbish and with excrements, of dogs andMOLLO V

masters, some dry and odourless, others still moist.Ah those papers 
never to be read again, perhaps never read.Here lovers must have 
lain at night and exchanged their vows.I entered one of the alcoves, 
wrong again, and leaned against the wall.I would have preferred 
to lie down and there was no proof that I would not.But for the 
moment I was content to lean against the wall, my feet far from 
the wall, on the verge of slipping, but I had other props, the tips of 
my crutches.But a few minutes later I crossed the alley into the 
other chapel, that’s the word, yvhere I felt I might feel better, and 
settled myself in the same hypotenusal posture.And at first I did 
actually seem to feel a little better, but little by little I acquired 
the conviction that such was not the case.A fine rain was falling 
and I took off my hat to give my skull the benefit of it, my skull 
all cracked and furrowed and on fire, on fire.But I also took it off 
because it was digging into my neck, because of the thrust of the 
wall.Summarization models summary:

So I had two good reasons for taking it off and they were 
none too many, neither alone would ever have prevailed I feel.I 
threw it from me with a careless lavish gesture and back it came, 
at the end of its string or lace, and after a few throws came to rest 
against my side.At last I began to think, that is to say to listen 
harder.Little chance of my being found there, I was in peace for 
as long as I could endure peace.For the space of an instant I 
considered settling down there, making it my lair and sanctuary, 
for the space of an instant.I took the vegetable knife from my 
pocket and set about opening my wrist.But pain soon got the better 
of me.First I cried out, then I gave up, closed the knife and put 
it back in my pocket.I wasn’t particularly disappointed, in my 
heart of hearts I had not hoped for anything better.So much for 
that.And backsliding has always depressed me, but life seems 
made up of backsliding, and death itself must be a kind of back- 
sliding, I wouldn’t be surprised.Did I say the wind had fallen?A fine rain falling, somehow that seems to exclude all idea of wind.My knees are enormous, I have just caught a glimpse of them, when 
I got up for a second.My two legs are as stiff as a life-sentence and 
yet I sometimes get up.What can you expect?Thus from time to

still alive?Or again.

Oh it’s only a diary, it’ll soon be over.That my 
knees are enormous, that I still get up from time to time, these are 
things that do not seem at first sight to signify anything in particu- 
lar.I record them all the more willingly.In the end I left the im- 
passe, where half-standing, half-lying I may have had a little sleep, 
my little morning sleep, and I set off, believe it or not, towards 
the sun, why not, the wind having fallen.Or rather towards the 
least gloomy quarter of the heaven^, which a vast cloud was shroud- 
ing from the zenith to the skylines.It was from this cloud the 
above rain was falling.See how all things hang together.And as 
to making up my mind which quarter of the heavens was the least 
gloomy, it was no easy matter.For at first sight the heavens seemed 
uniformly gloomy.But by taking a little pains, for there were 
moments in my life when I took a little pains, I obtained a result, 
that is to say I came to a decision, in this matter.So I was able to 
continue on my way, saying, I am going towards the sun, that is 
to say in theory towards the East, or perhaps the South-East, for 
I am no longer with Lousse, but out in the heart again of the pre- 
established harmony, which makes so sweet a music, which is so 
sweet a music, for one who has an car for music.People were

by they the category to which he did not belong, or so I imagine.As many a one too must have said, I am right, they are wrong, 
while continuing to storm against the foul weather that was the 
occasion of his superiority.But at the sight of a young old man 
of wretched aspect, shivering all alone in a narrow doorway, I 
suddenly remembered the project conceived the day of my en- 
counter with Lousse and her dog and which this encounter had 
prevented me from carrying out.So I went and stood beside him,

which I wished to seem spontaneous and so did not make at once, 
he went out into the rain and away.For this speech was one liable, 
in virtue of its content, if not to offend at least to astonish.And that was why it was important to deliver it at the right 
moment and in the right tone.I apologise for these details, 
in a moment we’ll go faster, much faster.And then perhaps 
relapse again into a wealth of filthy circumstance.But which 
in its turn again will give way to vast frescoes, dashed off with 
loathing.Homo mensura can’t do without stallage.There I am 
then in my turn alone, in the doorway.

I could not hope for anyone 
to come and stand beside me, and yet it was a possibility I did not 
exclude.That’s a fairly good caricature of my state of mind at that 
instant.Net result, I stayed where I was.I had stolen from Lousse 
a little silver, oh nothing much, massive teaspoons for the most 
part, and other small objects whose utility I did not grasp, but 
which seemed as if they might have some value.Among these 
latter there was one which haunts me still, from time to time.It 
consisted of two crosses joined, at their points of intersection, by 
a bar., and resembled a tiny sawing-horse, with this difference 
however, that the crosses of the true sawing-horse are not perfect 
crosses, but truncated at the top, whereas the crosses of the little 
object I am referring to were perfect, that is to say composed each 
of two identical V’s, one upper with its opening above, like all V’s 
for that matter, and the other lower with its opening below, or more 
precisely of four rigorously identical V’s, the two I have just named 
and then two more, one on the right hand, the other on the left, 
having their openings on the right and the left respectively.But 
perhaps it is out of place to speak here of right and left, of upper 
and lower.For this little object did not seem to have any base 
properly so-called, but stood with equal stability on any one of its 
true of the sawing-horse.Summarization models summary:

knowing anything, to know you are beyond knowing anything, that 
is when peace enters in, to the soul of the incurious seeker.It is 
then the true division begins, of twenty-two by seven for example, 
and the pages fill with the true ciphers at last.But I would rather 
not affirm anything on this subject.What does seem undeniable 
to me on the contrary is this, that giving in to the evidence, to a 
very strong probability rather, I left the shelter of the doorway 
and began levering myself forward, swinging slowly through the 
sullen air.There is rapture, or there should be, in the motion 
crutches give.It is a series of little flights, skimming the ground.

You take off, you land, through the thronging sound in wind and 
limb, who have to fasten one foot to the ground before they dare 
lift up the other.And even their most joyous hastenings is less 
aerial than my hobble.But these are reasonings, based on analysis.• 
And though my mind was still taken up with my mother, and with 
the desire to know if I was near her, it was gradually less so, 
perhaps because of the silver in my pockets, but I think not, and 
then too because these were ancient cares and the mind cannot 
always brood on the same cares, but needs fresh cares from time 
to time, so as to revert with renewed vigour, when the time comes, 
to ancient cares.But can one speak here of fresh and ancient cares?I think not.But it would be hard for me to prove it.What I can 
assert, without fear of — without fear, is that I gradually lost interest 
in knowing, among other things, what town I was in and if I should 
soon find my mother and settle the matter between us.And even 
the nature of that matter grew dim, for me, without however vanish- 
ing completely.For it was no small matter and I was bent on it.All my life, I think, I had been bent on it.Yes, so far as I was 
capable of being bent on anything all a lifetime long, and what a

and me, but had never succeeded.And while saying to myself thatMOLLOY

Merging and summarizing: 

time was running out, and that soon it would be too late, was per- 
haps too late already, to settle the matter in question, I felt myself 
drifting towards other cares, other phantoms.And far more than 
to know what town I was in, my haste was now to leave it, even 
were it the right one, where my mother had waited so long and 
perhaps was waiting still.And it seemed to me that if I kept on in 
a straight line I was bound to leave it, sooner or later.So I set 
myself to this as best I could, making allowance for the drift to 
the right of the feeble light that was my guide.And my pertinacity 
was such that I did indeed come' to the ramparts as night was fall- 
ing, having described a good quarter of a circle, through bad navi- 
gation.It is true I stopped many times, to rest, but not for long, 
for I felt harried, wrongly perhaps.But in the country there is 
another justice, other judges, at first.And having cleared the ram- 
parts I had to confess the sky was clearing, prior to its winding in 
the other shroud, night.Yes, the great cloud was ravelling, discover- 
ing here and there a pale and dying sky, and the sun, already down, 
was manifest in the livid tongues of fire darting towards the zenith, 
falling and darting again, ever more pale and languid, and doomed 
i no sooner lit to be extinguished.This phenomenon, if I remember 
rightly, was characteristic of my region.Things are perhaps dif- 
ferent today.Though I fail to see, never having left my region, 
what right I have to speak of its characteristics.

No, I never escaped, 
and even the limits of my region were unknown to me.But I felt 
they were far away.But this feeling was based on nothing serious, 
it was a simple feeling.For if my region had ended no further than 
my feet could carry me, surely I would have felt it changing slowly.For regions do not suddenly end, as far as I know, but gradually 
merge into one another.And I never noticed anything of the kind, 
but however far I went, and in no matter what direction, it was al- 
ways the same sky, always the same earth, precisely, day after day 
and v.igrit after night.On the other hand, if it is true that regions 
gradually merge into one another, and this remains to be proved, 
then I may well have left mine many times, thinking I was still 
within it.But I preferred to abide by my simple feeling and its 
voice that said, Molloy, your region is vast, you have never left it 
and you never shall.And wheresoever you wander, within its distant66

limits, things will always be the same, precisely.It would thus 
appear, if this is so, that my movements owed nothing to the places 
they caused to vanish, but were due to something else, to the 
buckled wheel that carried me, in unforeseeable jerks, from fatigue 
to rest, and inversely, for example.But now I do not wander any 
more, anywhere any more, and indeed I scarcely stir at all, and 
yet nothing is changed.And the confines of my room, of my bed, 
of my body, are as remote from me as were those of my region, in 
the days of my splendour.Summarization models summary:

without mother.And when I see my hands, on the sheet, which 
they love to floccillate already, they arc not mine, less than ever 
mine, I have no arms, they are a couple, they play with the sheet, 
love-play perhaps, trying to get up perhaps, one on top of the other.But it doesn’t last, I bring them back, little by little, towards me, 
it’s resting time.And with my feet it’s the same, sometimes, when 
I see them at the foot of the bed, one with toes, the other without.And that is more deserving of mention.For my legs, corresponding 
here to my arms of a moment ago, are both stiff now and very 
sore, and I shouldn't be able to forget them as I can my arms, « 
which are more or less sound and well.And yet I do forget them 
and I watch the couple as they watch each other, a great way off.But my feet are not like my hands, I do not bring them back to 
me, when they become my feet again, for I cannot, but they stay 
there, far from me, but not so far as before.End of the recall.But 
you'd think that once well clear of the town, and having turned 
round to look at it, what there was to sec of it, you’d think that 
then I should have realised whether it was really my town or not.But no, I looked at it in vain, and perhaps unquestioningly, and 
simply to give the gods a chance, by turning round.Perhaps I only 
made a show of looking at it.

I didn’t feel I missed my bicycle, 
no, not really, I didn’t mind going on my way the way I said, 
swinging low in the dark over the earth, along the little empty 
country roads.And I said there was little likelihood of my being

who himself is night, day and night.No there is not much to be

population have no part in it, preferring their warm beds, all things 
considered.Day is the time for lynching, for sleep is sacred, and 
especially the morning, between breakfast and lunch.My first care 
then, after a few miles in the desert dawn, was to look for a place 
to sleep, for sleep too is a kind of protection, strange as it may 
seem.For sleep, if it excites the lust to capture, seems to appease 
the lust to kill, there and then and bloodily, any hunter will tell 
you that.For the monster on the move, or on the watch, lurking in 
his lair, there is no mercy, whereas he taken unawares, in his sleep, 
may sometimes get the benefit of milder feelings, which deflect the

passion.And it is thanks to this sweet sleep of terror or exhaustion

their elders, on Sundays and Bank Holidays.And I for my part 
have always preferred slavery to death, I mean being put to death.For death is a condition I have never been able to conceive to my 
satisfaction and which therefore cannot go down in the ledger of 
weal and woe.Whereas my notions on being put to death inspired 
me with confidence, rightly or wrongly, and I felt I was entitled 
to act on them, in certain emergencies.Oh they weren’t notions like 
yours, they were notions like mine, all spasm, sweat and trembling, 
without an atom of common sense or lucidity.But they were the 
best I h^d.Yes, the confusion of my ideas on the subject of death 
was such that I sometimes wondered, believe me or not, if it wasn’t 
a state of being even worse than life.So I found it natural not to 
rush into it and, when I forgot myself to the point of trying, to stop 
in time.It’s my only excuse.So I crawled into some hole somewhere 
I suppose and waited, half sleeping, half sighing, groaning and 
laughing, or feeling my body, to sec if anything had changed, for 
the morning frenzy to abate.Then 1 resumed my spirals.And as 
to saying what became of me, and where I went, in the months and 
perhaps the years that followed, no.For I weary of these inventions 
and others beckon to me.But in order to blacken a few more pages 
may I say I spent some time at the seaside, without incident.There 
are people the sea doesn’t suit, who prefer the mountains or the 
plain.Summarization models summary:

Personally I feel no worse there than anywhere else.Much 
of my life has ebbed away before this shivering expanse, to the 
sound of the waves in storm and calm, and the claws of the surf.Before, no, more than before, one with, spread on the sand, or in 
a cave.In the sand I was in my element, letting it trickle between 
my fingers, scooping holes that I filled in a moment later or that 
filled themselves in, flinging it in the air by handfuls, rolling in it.And in the cave, lit by the beacons at night, I knew what to do in 
order to be no worse off than elsewhere.And that my land went 
no further, in one direction at least, did not displease me.And to 
feel there was one direction at least in which I could go no further, 
without first getting wet,, then drowned, was a blessing.For I have 
always said.First learn to walk, then you can take swimming 
lessons.But don’t imagine my region ended at the coast, that would 
be a grave mistake.For It was this sea too, its reefs and distantMOLLOY
69
islands, and its hidden depths.And I too once went forth on it, 
in a sort of oarless skiff, but I paddled with an old bit of driftwood.And I sometimes wonder if I ever came back, from that voyage.For if I see myself putting to sea, and the long hours without land- 
fall, I do not see the return, the tossing on the breakers, and I do 
not hear the frail keel grating on the shore.I took advantage of 
being at the seaside to lay in a store of sucking-stones.They were 
pebbles but I call them stones.

Yes, on this occasion I laid in a 
considerable store.I distributed them equally between my four 
pockets, and sucked them turn ahd turn about.This raised a prob- 
lem which I first solved in the following way.I had say sixteen 
stones, four in each of my four pockets these being the two pockets 
of my trousers and the two pockets of my greatcoat.Taking a 
stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat, and putting it in my 
mouth, I replaced it in the right pocket of my greatcoat by a stone 
from the right pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone 
from the left pocket of my trousers, which I replaced by a stone 
from the left pocket of my greatcoat, which I replaced by the stone 
which was in my mouth, as soon as I had finished sucking it.Thus 
there were still four stones in each of my four pockets, but not 
quite the same stones.And when the desire to suck took hold of 
me again, I drew again on the right pocket of my greatcoat, certain 
of not taking the same stone as the last time.And while I sucked 
it I rearranged the other stones in the way I have just described.And so on.But this solution did not satisfy me fully.For it did 
not escape me that, by an extraordinary hazard, the four stones 
circulating thus might always be the same four.In which case, far 
from sucking the sixteen stones turn and turn about, I was really only 
sucking four, always the same, turn and turn about.But I shuffled 
them well in my pockets, before I began to suck, and again, while 
I sucked, before transferring them, in the hope of obtaining a more 
general circulation of the stones from pocket to pocket.Summarization models summary:

But this 
was only a makeshift that could not long content a man like me.So I began to look for something else.And the first thing I hit 
upon was that I might do better to transfer the stones four by four, 
instead of one by one, that is to say, during the sucking, to take 
the three stones remaining in the right jJocket of my greatcoat and70

replace them by the four in the right pocket of my trousers, and 
these by the four in the left pocket of my trousers, and these by the 
four in the left pocket of my greatcoat, and finally these by the 
three from the right pocket of my greatcoat, plus the one, as soon 
as I had finished sucking it, which was in my mouth.Yes, it seemed 
to me at first that by so doing I would arrive at a better result.But on further reflection I had to change my mind and confess that 
the circulation of the stones four by four came to exactly the same 
thing as their circulation one by one.For if I was certain of finding 
each time, in the right pocket of' my greatcoat, four stones totally 
different from their immediate predecessors, the possibility never- 
theless remained of my always chancing on the same stone, within 
each group of four, and consequently of my sucking, not the sixteen 
turn and turn about as I wished, but in fact four only, always the 
same, turn and turn about.So I had to seek elsewhere than in the 
mode of circulation.For no matter how I caused the stones to cir- 
culate.I always ran the same risk.

It was obvious that by increasing 
the number of my pockets I was bound to increase my chances of 
enjoying my stones in the way I planned, that is to say one after 
the other until their number was exhausted.Had I had eight 
pockets, for example, instead of the four I did have, then even the 
most diabolical hazard could not have prevented me from sucking 
at least eight of my sixteen stones, turn and turn about.The truth 
is I should have needed sixteen pockets in order to be quite easy in 
my mind.And for a long time I could sec no other conclusion 
than this, that short of having sixteen pockets, each with its stone, 
I could never reach the goal I had set myself, short of an extra- 
ordinary hazard.And if at a pinch I could double the number of 
my pockets, were it only by dividing each pocket in two, with the 
help of a few safety-pins let us say, to quadruple them seemed to 
be more than I could manage.And T did not feel inclined to take all 
that trouble for a half-measure.For I was beginning to lose all sense 
of measure, after all this wrestling and wrangling, and to say.All 
or nothing.And if I was tempted for an instant to establish a more 
equitable proportion between my stones and my pockets, by reduc- 
ing the former to the number of the latter, it was only for an instant.For it would have been an admission of defeat.And sitting on theMOLLOY

This method resulted in the transfer of the stones four by four instead of one by one.
The circulation of these stones was the same throughout the process, resulting in the same number of stones being transferred each time.
Despite this, despite increasing the number of pockets and increasing the circulation, the stones always returned to the same group of four within each group.

For just as I had difficulty 
in sitting on a chair, or in an arm-chair, because of my stiff leg 
you understand, so I had none in sitting on the ground, because 
of my stiff leg and my stiffening leg, for it was about this time that 
my good leg, good in the sense that it was not stiff, began to stiffen.I needed a prop under the ham you understand, and even under 
the whole length of the leg, the prop of the earth.And while I 
gazed thus at my stones, revolving interminable martingales all 
equally defective, and crushing Handfuls of sand, so that the sand 
ran through my fingers and fell back on the strand, yes, while thus 
I lulled my mind and part of my body, one day suddenly it dawned 
on the former, dimly, that I might perhaps achieve my purpose 
without increasing the number of my pockets, or reducing the 
number of my stones, but simply by sacrificing the principle of 
trim.The meaning of this illumination, which suddenly began to 
sing within me, like a verse of Isaiah, or of Jeremiah, I did not 
penetrate at once, and notably the word trim, which I had never 
met with, in this sense, long remained obscure.Finally I seemed 
, k to grasp that this word trim could not here mean anything else, 
anything better, than the distribution of the sixteen stones in 
four groups of four, one group in each pocket, and that it was my 
refusal to consider any distribution other than this that had vitiated 
my calculations until then and rendered the problem literally in- 
soluble.

And it was on the basis of this interpretation, whether right 
or wrong, that I finally reached a solution, inelegant assuredly, but 
sound, sound.Now I am willing to believe, indeed I firmly believe, 
that other solutions to this problem might have been found, and 
indeed may still be found, no less sound, but much more elegant, 
than the one I shall now describe, if I can.And I believe too that 
had I been a little more insistent, a little more resistant, I could 
have fr and them myself.But I was tired, but I was tired, and I 
cont nted myself ingloriously with the first solution that was a 
solution, to this problem.But not to go over the heartbreaking 
stages through which I passed before I came to it, here it is, in all 
its hideousness.All (all!)that was necessary was to put for

suck it, stop sucking it, put it in the left pocket of my greatcoat, 
the one empty (of stones).I take a second stone from the right 
pocket of my greatcoat, suck it, put it in the left pocket of my 
greatcoat.And so on until the right pocket of my greatcoat is 
empty (apart from its usual and casual contents) and the six stones 
I have just sucked, one after the other, are all in the left pocket of 
my greatcoat.Pausing then, and concentrating, so as not to make a

there are no stones left, the five stones in the right pocket of my 
trousers, which I replace by the five stones in the left pocket of my 
trousers, which I replace by the six stones in the left pocket of my 
greatcoat.At this stage then the left pocket of my greatcoat is 
again empty of stones, while the right pocket of my greatcoat is 
again supplied, and in the right way, that is to say with other stones 
than those I have just sucked.These other stones I then begin 
to suck, one after the other, and to transfer as I go along to 
the left pocket of my greatcoat, being absolutely certain, as far 
as one can be in an affair of this kind, that I am not sucking the 
same stones as a moment before, but others.

And when the right 
pocket of my greatcoat is again empty (of stones), and the five I 
have just sucked are all without exception in the left pocket of my 
greatcoat, then I proceed to the same redistribution as a moment 
before, or a similar redistribution, that is to say I transfer to the 
right pocket of my greatcoat, now again available, the five stones 
in the right pocket of my trousers, which I replace by the six stones 
in the left pocket of my trousers, which I replace by the five stones 
in the left pocket of my greatcoat.And there I am ready to begin 
again.Do I have to go on?No, for it is clear that after the nextMOLLOY

series, of sucks and transfers, I shall be back where I started, that 
is to say with the first six stones back in the supply pocket, the 
next five in the right pocket of my stinking old trousers and finally 
the last five in left pocket of same, and my sixteen stones will have 
been sucked once at least in impeccable succession, not one sucked 
twice, not one left unsucked.It is true that the next time I could 
scarcely hope to suck my stones in the same order as the first time 
and that the first, seventh and twelfth for example of the first 
cycle might very well be the sixth, eleventh and sixteenth respec- 
tively of the second, if the worst* came to the worst.But that was 
a drawback I could not avoid.And if in the cycles taken together 
utter confusion was bound to reign, at least within each cycle 
taken separately I could be easy in my mind, at least as easy as 
one can be, in a proceeding of this kind.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
For in order for each 
cycle to be identical, as to the succession of stones in my mouth, 
and God knows I had set my heart on it, the only means were 
numbered stones or sixteen pockets.And rather than make twelve 
more pockets or number my stones, I preferred to make the best 
of the comparative peace of mind I enjoyed within each cycle taken 
separately.For it was not enough to number the stones, but I would 
have had to remember, every time I put a stone in my mouth, the 
number I needed and look for it in my pocket.Which would have 
put me off stone for ever, in a very short time.For I would never 
have been sure of not making a mistake, unless of course I had 
kept a kind of register, in which to tick off the stones one by one, 
as I sucked them.And of this I believed myself incapable.No, the 
only perfect solution would have been the sixteen pockets, sym- 
metrically disposed, each one with its stone.Then I would have 
needed neither to number nor to think, but merely, as I sucked a 
given stone, to move on the fifteen others, each to the next pocket, 
a delicate business admittedly, but within my power, and to call 
always on the same pocket when I felt like a suck.This would 
have freed me from all anxiety, not only within each cycle taken 
separately, but also for the sum of all cycles, though they went on 
forever.But however imperfect my own solution was, I was pleased 
at having found it all alone, yes, quite pleased.And if it was 
perhaps less sound than I had thought in'the first flush of discovery.74

its inelegance never diminished.

And it was above all inelegant in 
this, to my mind, that the uneven distribution was painful to me, 
bodily.It is true that a kind of equilibrium was reached, at a given 
moment, in the early stages of each cycle, namely after the third 
suck and before the fourth, but it did not last long, and the rest 
of the time I felt the weight of the stones dragging me now to one 
side, now to the other.So it was something more than a principle 
I abandoned, when I abandoned the equal distribution, it was a 
bodily need.But to suck the stones in the way I have described, 
not haphazard, but with method, was also I think a bodily need.Here then were two incompatible bodily needs, at loggerheads.Such things happen.But deep down I didn’t give a tinker’s curse 
about being off my balance, dragged to the right hand and the left, 
backwards and forwards.And deep down it was all the same to 
me whether I sucked a different stone each time or always the 
same stone, until the end of time.For they all tasted exactly the 
same.And if I had collected sixteen, it was not in order to ballast 
myself in such and such a way, or to suck them turn about, but 
simply to have a little store, so as never to be without.But deep 
down I didn’t give a fiddler’s curse about being without, when they 
were all gone they would be all gone, I wouldn’t be any the worse 
off, or hardly any.Summarization models summary:

And the solution to which I rallied in the end 
was to throw away all the stones but one, which I kept now in one 
pocket, now in another, and which of course I soon lost, or threw 
away, or gave away, or swallowed.It was a wild part of the coast.I don’t remember having been seriously molested.The black speck 
I was, in the great pale stretch of sand, who could wish it harm?Some came near, to see what it was, whether it wasn’t something 
of value from a wreck, washed up by the storm.But when they 
saw the jetsam was alive, decently if wretchedly clothed, they turned 
away.Old women and young ones, yes, too, come to gather wood, 
came and stared, in the early days.But they were always the same 
and it was in vain I moved from one place to another, in the end 
they all knew what I was and kept their distance.1 think one of 
them one day, detaching herself from her companions, came and 
offered me something to eat and that I looked at her in silence, 
until she went away.YSs, it seems to me some such incidentMOLLOY
75
occurred about this time.But perhaps I am thinking of another 
stay, at an earlier time, for this will be my last, my last but one, or 
two, there is never a last, by the sea.However that may be I see a 
young woman coming towards me and stopping from time to time 
to look back at her companions.Huddled together like sheep they 
watch her recede, urging her on, and laughing no doubt, I seem to 
hear laughter far away.

Then it is her back I see, as she goes away, 
now it is towards me she looks back, but without stopping.But 
perhaps I am merging two times in one, and two women, one com* 
ing towards me, shyly, urged on* by the cries and laughter of her 
companions, and the other going away from me, unhesitatingly.For those who came towards me I saw coming from afar, most 
of the time, that is one of the advantages of the seaside.Black 
specks in the distance I saw them coming, I could follow all their 
manoeuvres, saying.It’s getting smaller, or, it’s getting bigger.Yes, to be taken unawares was so to speak impossible, for I 
turned often towards the land too.Let me tell you something, my 
sight was better at the seaside!Yes, ranging far and wide over 
these vast flats, where nothing lay, nothing stood, my good eye 
saw more clearly and there were even days when the bad one too 
had to look away.And not only did I see more clearly, but I had 
less difficulty in saddling with a name the rare things I saw.These 
are some of the advantages and disadvantages of the seaside.Or 
perhaps it was I who was changing, why not?And in the morning, 
in my cave, and even sometimes at night, when the storm raged, 
I felt reasonably secure from the elements and mankind.But there 
too there is a price to pay.In vour box, in your caves, there too 
there is a price to pay.And which you pay willingly, for a time, 
but which you cannot go on paying forever.For you cannot go 
on buying the same thing forever, with your little pittance.Summarization models summary:

SAMUEL BECKETT
as far back as I can remember, and some of my memories have 
their roots deep in the immediate past, there was always talk of 
draining, by means of canals I suppose, or of transforming into 
a vast port and docks, or into a city on piles for the workers, in 
a word of redeeming somehow or other.And with the same stone 
they would have killed the scandal, at the gates of their metropolis, 
of a stinking steaming swamp in which an incalculable number 
of human lives were yearly engulfed, the statistics escape me for 
the moment and doubtless always will, so complete is my indiffer- 
ence to this aspect of the question.It is true they actually began 
to work and that work is still going on in certain areas in the teeth 
of adversity, setbacks, epidemics and the apathy of the Public 
Works Department, far from me to deny it.But from this to pro- 
claiming that the sea came lapping at the ramparts of my town, 
there was a far cry.

And I for my part will never lend myself to 
such a perversion (of the truth), until such time as I am compelled 
or find it convenient to do so.And I knew this swamp a little, 
having risked my life in it, cautiously, on several occasions, at a 
period of my life richer in illusions than the one I am trying to 
patch together here, I mean richer in certain illusions, in others 
poorer.So there was no way of coming at my town directly, by sea, 
but you had to disembark well to the north or the south and 
take to the roads, just imagine that, for they had never heard of 
Watt, just imagine that too.And now my progress, slow and pain- 
ful at all times, was more so than ever, because of my short stiff leg, 
the same which I thought had long been as stiff as a leg could be, but 
damn the bit of it, for it was growing stiffer than ever, a thing I 
would not have thought possible, and at the same time shorter 
every day, but above all because of the other leg, supple hitherto 
and now growing rapidly stiff in its turn, but not yet shortening, 
unhappily.For when the two legs shorten at the same time, and at 
the same speed, then all is not lost, no.But when one shortens, 
and the other not, then you begin to be worried.Oh not that I 
was exactly worried, but it was a nuisance, yes, a nuisance.For 
I didn’t know which foot to land on, when I came down.Let us 
try and get this dilemma clear.Follow me carefully.The stiff leg

which I normally used as a pivot, or prop.But now this latter, 
as a result of its stiffening I suppose, and the ensuing commotion 
among nerves and sinews, was beginning to hurt me even more 
than the other.What a story, God send I don’t make a balls of it.For the old pain, do you follow me, I had got used to it, in a way, 
yes, in a kind of way.Whereas to the new pain, though of the same 
family exactly, I had not yet had time to adjust myself.Nor should 
it be forgotten that having one bad leg plus another more or less 
good, I was able to nurse the former, and reduce its sufferings to 
the minimum, to the maximum, by using the former exclusively, 
with the help of my crutches.But I no longer had this resource!For I no longer had one bad leg plus another more or less good, 
but now both were equally bad.And the worse, to my mind, was 
that which till now had been good, at least comparatively good, 
and whose change for the worse I had not yet got used to.So in 
a way, if you like, I still had one bad leg and one good, or rather 
less bad, with this difference however, that the less bad now was 
the less good of heretofore.It was therefore on the old bad leg 
that I often longed to lean, between one crutchstroke and the next.JFor while still extremely sensitive, it was less so than the other, 
or it was equally so, if you like, but it did not seem so, to me, 
because of its seniority.But I couldn’t!What?Lean on it.

For it 
was shortening, don’t forget, whereas the other, though stiffening, 
was not yet shortening, or so far behind its fellow that to all intents 
and purposes, intents and purposes, I’m lost, no matter.If I could 
even have bent it, at the knee, or even at the hip, I could have made 
it seem as short as the other, long enough to land on the true short

any case the ways I went were for the most part little forest paths, 
that’s understandable, where differences of level, though abounding, 
were too confused and too erratic to be of any help to me.But did 
it make such a difference after all, as far as the pain was concerned, 
whether my leg was free to rest or whether it had to work?I think 
not.For the suffering of the leg at rest was constant and monoto- 
nous.Whereas the leg condemned to the increase of pain inflicted 
by work knew the decrease of pain dispensed by work suspended, 
the space of an instant.But I am human, I fancy, and my progress 
suffered, from this state of affairs, and from the slow and painful 
progress it had always been, whatever may have been said to the 
contrary, was changed, saving your presence, to a veritable cal- 
vary, with no limit to its stations and no hope of crucifixion, though 
I say it myself, and no Simon, and reduced me to frequent halts.Yes, my progress reduced me to stopping more and more often,, 
it was the only way to progress, to stop.

And though it is no part 
of my tottering intentions to treat here in full, as they deserve, 
these brief moments of the immemorial expiation, I shall never-

so that my story, so clear till now, may not end in darkness, the 
darkness of these towering forests, these giant fronds, where I

stretched palely between the last boles, and my mother, to settle 
with her, and if I would not do better, at least just as well, to hang 
myself from a bough, with a liane.For, frankly, light meant noth- 
ing to me now, and my mother could scarcely be waiting for me 
still, after so long.And my legs, my legs.But the thought of suicide 
had little hold on me, I don’t know why, I thought 1 did, but I

The noise betrayed me, I turned 
purple.It came on mostly at night, fortunately, or unfortunately, 
I could never make up my mind.For if sudden changes of colour 
matter less at night, the least unusual noise is then more noticeable, 
because of the silence of the nigfit.But these were mere crises, and 
what are crises compared to all that never stops, knows neither 
ebb nor flow, its surface leaden above infernal depths.Not a word, 
not a word against the crises that seized me, wrung me, and finally 
threw me away, mercifully, safe from help.And I wrapped my 
head in my coat, to stifle the obscene noise of choking, or I dis- 
guised it as a fit of coughing, universally accepted and approved 
and whose only disadvantage is this, that it is liable to let you in 
for pity.And this is perhaps the moment to observe, better late 
than never, that when I speak of my progress being slowed down, 
consequent on the defection of my good leg, I express only an infini- 
tesimal part of the truth.For the truth is I had other weak points, 
here and there, and they too were growing weaker and weaker, 
as was only to be expected.But what was not to be expected was 
the speed at which their weakness had increased, since my depar- 
ture from the seaside.For as long as I had remained at the seaside 
my weak points, while admittedly increasing in weakness, as was 
only to be expected, only increased imperceptibly, in weakness I 
mean.

So that I would have hesitated to exclaim, with my finger 
up my arse-hole for example, Jesus-Christ, it’s much worse than 
yesterday, I can hardly believe it is the same hole.I apologise for 
having to revert to this lewd orifice, 'tis my muse will have it so.Perhaps ; " is less to be thought of as the eyesore here called by its

that is not rejected on the spot, or very nearly.Almost everything 
revolts it that comes from without and what comes from within 
does not seem to receive a very warm welcome either.Are not 
these significant facts?Time will tell.But I shall do my utmost 
none the less to keep it in the background in the future.And that 
will be easy, for the future is by no means uncertain, the unspeak- 
able future.And when it comes to neglecting fundamentals, I think 
I have nothing to learn, and indeed I confuse them with accidentals.But to -return to my weak poirits, let me say again that at the 
seaside they had developed normally, yes, I had noticed nothing 
abnormal.Summarization models summary:

presentiment, and that I understand is very often the case with 
the best presentiments, that you can make no sense of them.So 
perhaps it is a true presentiment, apt to be borne out.But can 
any more sense be made of false presentiments?I think so, yes,I think that all that is false may more readily be reduced, to notions 
clear and distinct, distinct from all other notions.But I may be 
wrong.But I was not given to presentiments, but to sentiments 
sweet and simple, to episentiments rather, if I may venture to say 
so.For I knew in advance, which made all presentiment superfluous.I will even go further (what can 1 lose?), I knew only in advance, 
for when the time came I knew no longer, you may have noticed 
it, or only when I made a superhuman effort, and when the time 
was past I no longer knew either, I regained my ignorance.And all 
that taken together, if that is possible, should serve to explain many 
things, and notably my astonishing old age, still green in places, 
assuming the state of my health, in spite of all I have said about

The fact is, and I deplore it, but it is too late now to do anything 
about it, that I have laid too much stress on my legs, throughout 
these wanderings, to the detriment of the rest.For I was no ordin- 
ary cripple, far from it, and there were days when my legs were 
the best part of me, with the exception of the brain capable of 
forming such a judgement.I was therefore obliged to stop more 
and more often, I shall never weary of repeating it, and to lie 
down, in defiance of the rules, now prone, now supine, now on 
one side, now on the other, and as much as possible with the feet 
higher than the head, to dislodge the clots.And to lie with the feet 
higher than the head, when your legs arc stiff, is no easy matter.But don’t worry, I did it.When my comfort was at stake there was 
no trouble I would not go to.The forest was all about me and the 
boughs, twining together at a prodigious height, compared to mine.MOLLO Y

sheltered me from the light and the elements.Some days I advanced 
no more than thirty or forty paces, I give you my oath.To say 
I stumbled in impenetrable darkness, no, I cannot.I stumbled, 
but the darkness was not impenetrable.For there reigned a kind 
of blue gloom, more than sufficient for my visual needs.I was 
astonished this gloom was not green, rather than blue, but I saw 
it blue and perhaps it was.The red of the sun, mingling with the 
green of the leaves, gave a blue result, that is how I reasoned.But 
from time to time.

From time to time.What tenderness in these 
little words, what savagery.Bui from time to time I came on a 
kind of crossroads, you know, a star, or circus, of the kind to be 
found in even the most unexplored of forests.And turning then 
methodically to face the radiating paths in turn, hoping for I 
know not what, I described a complete circle, or less than a circle, 
or more than a circle, so great was the resemblance between them.Here the gloom was not so thick and I made haste to leave it.I 
don’t like gloom to lighten, there’s something shady about it.I 
had a certain number of encounters in this forest, naturally, where 
does one not, but nothing to signify.I notably encountered a char- 
coal-burner.I might have loved him, I think, if I had been seventy 
years younger.But it’s not certain.For then he too would have 
been younger by as much, oh not quite as much, but much 
younger.I never really had much love to spare, but all the same 
I had my little quota, when I was small, and it went to the old men, 
when it could.And I even think I had time to love one or two, oh 
not with true love, no, nothing like the old woman.I’ve lost her 
name again.Rose, no, anyway you see who I mean, but all the 
same, how shall 1 say, tenderly, as those on the brink of a better 
earth.Ah I was a precocious child, and then I was a precocious 
man.Summarization models summary:

and accents.He did not know.He was born in the forest probably 
and had spent his whole life there.I asked him to show me the 
nearest way out of the forest.I grew eloquent.His reply was ex- 
ceedingly confused.Either I didn’t understand a word he said, or 
he didn't understand a word I said, or he knew nothing, or he 
wanted to keep me near him.It was towards this fourth hypothesis 
that in all modesty I leaned, for when I made to go, he held me 
back by the sleeve.So I smartly freed a crutch and dealt him a 
good dint on the skull.That calmed him.The dirty old brute.I got upiand went on.But I hadn't gone more than a few paces, and 
for me at this time a few paces meant something, when I turned 
and went back to where he lay, to examine him.Seeing he had not 
ceased to breathe I contented myself with giving him a few warm 
kicks in the ribs, with my heels.

This is how I went about it.I 
carefully chose the most favourable position, a few paces from the 
body, with my back of course turned to it.Then, nicely balanced 
on my crutches, I began to swing, backwards, forwards, feet pressed 
together, or rather legs pressed together, for how could I press my 
feet together, with my legs in the state they were?But how could 
I press my legs together, in the state they were?I pressed them 
together, that’s all I can tell you.Take it or leave it.Or I didn’t 
press them together.What can that possibly matter?I swung, 
that’s all that matters, in an ever-widening arc, until I decided the 
moment had come and launched myself forward with all my 
strength and consequently, a moment later, backward, which gave 
the desired result.Where did I get this access of vigour?From my 
weakness perhaps.The shock knocked me down.Naturally.I came 
a cropper.You can't have everything.I’ve often noticed it.I rested 
a moment, then got up, picked up my crutches, took up my position 
on the other side of the body and applied myself with method to the 
same exercise.I always had a mania for symmetry.But I must have 
aimed a little low and one of my heels sank in something soft.However.For if I had missed the ribs, with that heel, I had no 
doubt landed in the kidney, oh not hard enough to burst it, no, 
I fancy not.People imagine, because you are old, poor, crippled, 
terrified, that you can’t stand up for yourself, and generally speak- 
ing that is so.Summarization models summary:

ward assailant, in your own class what, and a lonely place, and 
you have a good chance of showing what stuff you are made of.And it is doubtless in order to revive interest in this possibility, 
too often forgotten, that I have delayed over an incident of no 
interest in itself, like all that has a moral.But did I at least eat, 
from time to time?Perforce, perforce, roots, berries, sometimes a 
little mulberry, a mushroom from time to time, trembling, know- 
ing nothing about mushrooms.What else, ah yes, carobs, so dear 
to goats.In a word whatever I could find, forests abound in good 
things.And having heard, or rhore probably read somewhere, in 
the days when I thought I would be well advised to educate myself, 
or amuse myself, or stupefy myself, or kill time, that when a man 
in a forest thinks he is going forward in a straight line, in reality 
he is going in a circle, I did my best to go in a circle, hoping in this 
way to go in a straight line.For I stopped being half-witted and 
became sly, whenever I took the trouble.And my head was a store- 
house of useful knowledge.And if I did not go in a rigorously 
straight line, with my system of going in a circle, at least I did not 
go in a circle, and that was something.And by going on doing this, 
day after day, and night after night, I looked forward to getting 
out of the forest, some day.For my region was not all forest, far 
from it.

But there were plains too, mountains and sea, and some 
towns and villages, connected by highways and byways.And I 
was all the more convinced that I would get out of the forest 
some day as I had already got out of it, more than once, and I knew 
how difficult it was not to do again what you have done before.But things had been rather different then.And yet I did not despair 
of seeing the light tremble, some day, through the still boughs, the 
strange light of the plain, its pale wild eddies, through the bronze- 
still boughs, which no breath ever stirred.But it was a day I 
dreaded too.So that I was sure it would come sooner or later.For it -''as not so bad being in the forest, I could imagine worse, 
and l could have stayed there till I died, unrepining, yes, without 
pining for the light and the plain and the other amenities of 
my region.For I knew them well, the amenities of my region, 
and I considered that the forest was no worse.And it was not 
only no worse, to my mind, but it w£s better, in this sense, that86

I was there.That is a strange way, is it not, of looking at things.Perhaps less strange than it seems.For being in the forest, a place 
neither worse nor better than the others, and being free to stay 
there, was it not natural I should think highly of it, not because of 
what it was, but because I was there.For I was there.And being 
there I did not have to go there, and that was not to be despised, 
seeing the state of my legs and my body in general.Summarization models summary:

without remorse, without the painful impression of committing a 
fault, almost a sin.For I have greatly sinned, at all times, greatly

from places where, if all was not well, all was no worse than any- 
where else, and then went silent, leaving me stranded.So I knew 
my imperatives well, and yet I submitted to them.It had become 
a habit.It is true they nearly all bore on the same question, that 
of my relations with my mother, and on the importance of bringing 
as soon as possible some light to bear on these and even on the 
kind of light that should be brought to bear and the most effective 
means of doing so.

Yes, these imperatives were quite explicit and 
even detailed until, having set me in motion at last, they began to 
falter, then went silent, leaving me there like a fool who neither 
knows where he is going nor why he is going there.And they 
nearly all bore, as I may have said already, on the same painful 
and thorny question.And I do not think I could mention even one 
having a different purport.And the one enjoining me then to leave 
the forest without delay was in no way different from those I was

solemn warning, Perhaps it is already too late.It was in Latin,

of my mother, the fault must not be imputed solely to that voice 
which deserted me, prematurely.It was partly to blame, that’s all 
it can be reproached with.For the outer world opposed my suc- 
ceeding too, with its wiles, I have given some examples.And even 
if the voice could have harried me to the very scene of action, even 
then I might well have succeeded no better, because of the other 
obstacles barring my way.And in this command which faltered, 
then died, it was hard not to hear the unspoken entreaty.Don’t 
do it, Molloy.In forever reminding me thus of my duty was its 
purpose to show me the folly of it?Perhaps.Summarization models summary:

Fortunately it did no 
more than stress, the better to mock if you like, an innate velleity.And of myself, all my life, I think I had been going to my mother, 
with the purpose of establishing our relations on a less precarious 
footing.And when I was with her, and I often succeeded, I left her 
without having done anything.And when I was no longer with her 
I was again on my way to her, hoping to do better the next time.And when I appeared to give up and to busy myself with some- 
thing else, or with nothing at all any more, in reality I was hatching 
my plans and seeking the way to her house.This is taking a queer 
turn.So even without this so-called imperative I impugn, it would 
have been difficult for me to stay in the forest, since I was forced 
to assume my mother was not there.And yet it might have 
been better for me to try and stay.But I also said.Yet a little

happened was quite different.And I did not say.Yet a little while,

I would have said, if I had been able.In reality I said nothing at 
all, but I heard a murmur, something gone wrong with the silence, 
and I pricked up my ears, like an animal I imagine, which gives 
a start and pretends to be dead.And then sometimes there arose 
within me, confusedly, a kind of consciousness, which I express 
by saying, I said, etc., or.Don’t do it Molloy, or.Is that your 
mother’s dame?said the sergeant, I quote from memory.Or which 
I express without sinking to the level of oratio recta, but by means 
of other figures quite as deceitful, as for example.It seemed to me 
that, etc., or, I had the impression that, etc., for it seemed to me 
nothing at all, and I had no impression of any kind, but simply

that I can only express by saying, I feared that, or, I hoped that, 
or.Is that your mother’s name?said the sergeant, for example, 
and that I might doubtless have expressed otherwise and better, 
if I had gone to the trouble.And so I shall perhaps some day when 
I have less horror of trouble than today.But I think not.So I said.Yet a little while, at the rate things are going, and I won’t be able 
to move, but will have to stay, where I happen to be, unless some 
kind person comes and carries me.For my marches got shorter 
and shorter and my halts in consequence more and more frequent 
and I may add prolonged.For the notion of the long halt does not 
necessarily follow from that of the short march, nor that of the 
frequent halt cither, when you come to think of it, unless you give 
frequent a meaning it does not possess, and I could never bring 
myself to do a thing like that.And it seemed to me all the more 
important to get out of this forest with all possible speed as I would 
very soon be powerless to get out of anything whatsoever, were it 
but a bower.It was winter, it must have been winter, and not only 
many trees had lost their leaves, but these lost leaves had gone all 
black and spongy and my crutches sank into them, in places right

it was only autumn.But I was never very sensitive to changes of 
temperature.

And the gloom, if it seemed less blue than before, 
was as thick as ever.Which made me say in the end.It is less 
blue because there is less green, but it is no less thick thanks to the 
leaden winter sky.Then something about the black dripping from 
the black boughs, something in that line.The black slush of leaves 
slowed me down even more.But leaves or no leaves I would have 
abandoned erect motion, that of man.And I still remember the 
day when, flat on my face by way of rest, in defiance of the rules, 
I suddenly cried, striking my brow, Christ, there’s crawling, I never 
thought of that.But could I crawl, with my legs in such a state, and 
my trunk?And my head.But before I go on, a word about the 
forest murmurs.It was in vain I listened, I could hear nothing of 
the kind.But rather, with much goodwill and a little imagination, 
at long intervals a distant gong.A horn goes well with the forest, 
you expect it.It is the huntsman.But a gong!Even a tom-tom, 
at a pinch, would not have shocked me.But a gong !It was mortify- 
ing, to have been looking forward to the celebrated murmurs if to 
nothing else, and to succeed only in hearing, at long intervals, in 
the far distance, a gong.For a moment I dared hope it was only 
my heart, still beating.But only for a moment.For it does not beat, 
not my heart, I’d have to refer you to hydraulics for the squelch

To the leaves too I listened, before their 
fall, attentively in vain.They made no sound, motionless and rigid, 
like brass, have I said that before?So much for the forest mur- 
murs.From time to time I blew my horn, through the cloth in my 
pocket.Its hoot was fainter every time.I had taken it off my bicycle.When?I don’t know.And now, let us have done.Flat on my belly, 
using my crutches like grapnels, I plunged them ahead of me into 
the undergrowth, and when I felt they had a hold, I pulled myself 
forward, with an effort of the wrists.For my wrists were still quite 
strong, fortunately, in spite of my decrepitude, though all swollen 
and Tacked by a kind of chronic arthritis probably.That then 
briefly is how I went about it.The advantage of this mode of loco-

who moves in this way, crawling on his belly, like a reptile, no 
sooner comes to rest than he begins to rest, and even the very 
movement is a kind of rest, compared to other movements, I mean 
those that have worn me out.

And in this way I moved onward in 
the forest, slowly, but with a certain regularity, and I covered my 
fifteen paces, day in, day out, without killing myself.And I even 
crawled on my back, plunging my crutches blindly behind me into 
the thickets-, and with the black boughs for sky to my closing eyes.I was on my way to mother.And from time to time I said.Mother, 
to encourage me I suppose.I kept losing my hat, the lace had 
broken long ago, until in a fit of temper I banged it down on my 
skull with such violence that I couldn’t get it off again.And if I 
had met any lady friends, if I had had any lady friends, I would 
have been powerless to salute them correctly.But there was always 
present to my mind, which was still working, if laboriously, the 
need to turn, to keep on turning, and every three or four jerks I 
altered course, which permitted me to describe, if not a circle, at 
least a great polygon, perfection is not of this world, and to hope 
that I was going forward in a straight line, in spite of everything, 
day and night, towards my mother.And true enough the day came 
when the forest ended and I saw the light, the light of the plain, 
exactly as I had foreseen.But I did not see it from afar, trembling 
beyond the harsh trunks, as I had foreseen, but suddenly I was in 
it, I opened my eyes and saw I had arrived.And the reason for 
that was probably this, that for some time past I had not opened 
my eyes, or seldom.Summarization models summary:

I had taken my horn off my bicycle and used crutches to navigate through the forest, using them like grapnels to plunge into the undergrowth and pull myself forward with the strength of my wrists, which are still quite strong despite being swollen and possibly affected by a sore throat and scabies and ears. Then I took an umbrella using crutches to clear the distance of my ears from the ground. Finally, I took a rain umbrella to cover my face and chest. The air between the rain umbrella and the grass was so heavy that I fell down over the falls.

And even my little changes of course were 
made blindly, in the dark.The forest ended in a ditch, I don’t know 
why, and it was in this ditch that I became aware of what had 
happened to me.I suppose it v/as the fall into the ditch that opened 
my eyes, for why would they have opened otherwise?I looked at 
the plain rolling away as far as the eye could see.No, not quite 
so far as that.For my eyes having got used to the light I fancied 
I saw, faintly outlined against the horizon, the towers and steeples of 
a town, which of course I could not assume was mine, on such slight 
evidence.It is true the pla^n seemed familiar, but in my region allMOLLOY
91
the plains looked alike, when you knew one you knew them all.In any case, whether it was my town or not, whether somewhere 
under that faint haze my mother panted on, or whether she 
poisoned the air a hundred miles away, were ludicrously idle ques- 
tions for a man in my position, though of undeniable interest on 
the plane of pure knowledge.For how could I drag myself over 
that vast moor, where my crutches would fumble in vain.Rolling 
perhaps.And then?Would they let me roll on to my mother’s 
door?Fortunately for me at this painful juncture, which I had 
vaguely foreseen, but not in all its bitterness, I heard a voice telling 
me not to fret, that help was coming.Literally.

These words struck 
it is not too much to say as clearly on my ear, and on my under- 
standing, as the urchin’s thanks I suppose when I stooped and 
picked up his marble.Don’t fret, Molloy, we’re coming.Well, I 
suppose you have to try everything once, succour included, to get 
a complete picture of the resources of their planet.I lapsed down 
to the bottom of the ditch.It must have been spring, a morning 
in spring.I thought I heard birds, skylarks perhaps.I had not 
heard a bird for a long time.How was it I had not heard any in 
the forest?Nor seen any.It had not seemed strange to me.Had 
I heard any at the seaside?Mews?I could not remember.I remem- 
bered the corn-crakes.The two travellers came back to my memory.One had a club.I had forgotten them.I saw the sheep again.Or so 
I say now.I did not fret, other scenes of my life came back to me.There seemed to be rain, then sunshine, turn about.Real spring 
weather.I longed to go back into the forest.Oh not a real longing.Molloy could stay, where he happened to be.II
It is midnight.The rain is beating on the windows.I am calm.All is sleeping.Nevertheless I get up and go to my desk.I can’t 
sleep.My lamp sheds a soft and steady light.I have trimmed it.It will last till morning.I hear the eagle-owl.What a terrible battle- 
cry!Once I listened to it unmoved.My son is sleeping.Let him 
sleep.The night will come when he too.Summarization models summary:

wicker chair, a black book closed on my knees.It must have been 
about eleven o’clock, still too early to go to church.I was savour- 
ing the day of rest, while deploring the importance attached to it, 
in certain parishes.To work, even to play on Sunday, was not of 
necessity reprehensible, in my opinion.It all depended on the stateMOLLOY
93
of mind of him who worked, or played, and on the nature of his 
work, of his play, in my opinion.I was reflecting with satisfaction 
on this, that this slightly libertarian view was gaining ground, even 
among the clergy, more and more disposed to admit that the sab- 
bath, so long as you go to mass and contribute to the collection, 
may be considered a day like any other, in certain respects.This 
did not affect me personally.I’ve always loved doing nothing.And 
I would gladly have rested on weekdays too, if I could have afforded 
it.Not that I was positively lazy.It was something else.

Seeing 
something done which I could tthve done better myself, if I had 
wished, and which I did do better whenever I put my mind to it, 
I had the impression of discharging a function to which no form of 
activity could have exalted me.But this was a joy in which, during 
the week, I could seldom indulge.The weather was fine.I watched absently the coming and going 
of my bees.I heard on the gravel the scampering steps of my son, 
caught up in I know not what fantasy of flight and pursuit.I called 
to him not to dirty himself.He did not answer.All was still.Not a breath.From my neighbours’ chimneys 
the smoke rose straight and blue.None but tranquil sounds, the 
clicking of mallet and ball, a rake on pebbles, a distant lawn-mower, 
the bell of my beloved church.And birds of course, blackbird and 
thrush, their song sadly dying, vanquished by the heat, and leaving 
dawn’s high boughs for the bushes’ gloom.Contentedly I inhaled 
the scent of my lemon-verbena.In such surroundings slipped away my last moments of peace 
and happiness.A man came into the garden and walked swiftly towards me.I knew him well.Now I have no insuperable objection to a neigh- 
bour’s dropping in, on a Sunday, to pay his respects, if he feels the 
need, though I much prefer to see nobody.But this man was not a

was hidden from anybody coming into my grounds and following 
the short path which led from the garden-gate to the front door, 
and in fact I must have been.But at the noise of the gate being 
slammed I turned angrily and saw, blurred by the leaves, this high 
mass bearing down on me, across the lawn.I neither got up nor 
invited him to sit down.He stopped in front of me and we stared 
at each other in silence.He was dressed in his heavy, sombre 
Sunday best, and at this my displeasure knew no bounds.This 
gross external observance, while the soul exults in its rags, has 
always appeared to me an abomination.I watched the enormous 
feet crushing my daisies.I would gladly have driven him away, 
with a knout.Unfortunately it was not he who mattered.Sit down, 
I said, mollified by the reflection that after all he was only acting 
his part of go-between.Yes, suddenly I had pity on him, pity on 
myself.He sat down and mopped his forehead.1 caught a glimpse

and prying were part of my profession.My son imitated me in- 
stinctively.He returned after a remarkably short interval with two 
glasses and a quart bottle of beer.He uncorked the bottle and 
served us.He was very fond of uncorking bottles.I told him to 
go and wash himself, to straighten his clothes, in a word, to get 
ready to appear in public, for it would soon be time for mass.He can stay, said Gaber.I don’t wish him to stay, I said.And

was one thing displeased me, at that time, it was being late for the

but preferable, all things considered, to that of the finger in the 
nose, in my opinion.If putting his finger in his mouth prevented 
my son from putting it in his nose, or elsewhere, he was right to 
do it, in a sense.Here are your instructions, said Gaber.He took a notebook

said he had confidence in no one but me?I said.He doesn’t know

the lining of his bowler, peering inside as if in search of something.In that case it’s hard for me to refuse, I said, knowing perfectly 
well that in any case it was impossible for me to refuse.Refuse!But we agents often amused ourselves with grumbling among our- 
selves and giving ourselves the airs of free men.You leave

and then my lips moved visibly.But no doubt he was afraid of 
disturbing me and of being reprimanded.For I was sometimes 
inclined to go too far when I reprimanded my son, who was con-

chastened.Oh I had not been spoiled either, merely neglected.Whence bad habits ingrained beyond remedy and of which even 
the most meticulous piety has never been able to break me.I 
hoped to spare my son this misfortune, by giving him a good clout 
from time to time, together with my reasons for doing so.Then 
I said.Is he barefaced enough to tell me, on his return, that he 
has been to mass if he has not, if for example he has merely run 
off to join his little friends, behind the slaughter-house?And I 
determined to get the truth out of Father Ambrose, on this subject.For it was imperative my son should not imagine he was capable

The affair seems childishly simple.
Despite the affair, Gaber feels compelled to take part due to his weakness and fears for his son's well-being.
Gaber has a history of depression. During his enlistment he sought the help of a therapist and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.It seems the counselor helped him to overcome the emotional feelings and found a solution. So now he is in need of a thorough training program.

I would apply to the verger, whose vigilance it was 
inconceivable that the presence of my son at twelve o’clock mass 
had escaped.For I knew for a fact that the verger had a list of the 
faithful and that, from his place beside the font, he ticked us off 
when it came to the absolution.It is only fair to say that Father 
Ambrose knew nothing of these manoeuvres, yes, anything in the 
nature of surveillance was hateful to the good Father Ambrose.And he would have sent the verger flying about his business if 
he had suspected him of such a work of supererogation.It must 
have been for his own edification that the verger kept this register, 
with such assiduity.Admittedly I knew only what went on at the 
mass, having no experience personally of the other offices, for the 
good reason that I never went within a mile of them.But I had 
heard it said that they were the occasion of exactly the same super- 
vision, at the hands either of the verger himself or, when his duties 
called him elsewhere, of one of his sons.A strange parish whose 
flock knew more than its pastor of a circumstance which seemed 
rather in his province than in theirs.Such were my thoughts as I waited for my son to come back 
and Gaber, whom I had not yet heard leave, to go.And tonight 
I find it strange I could have thought of such things, I mean my 
son, my lack of breeding.Father Ambrose, Verger Joly with his

what I had just heard?The fact is I had not yet begun to take 
the matter seriously.

And I am all the more surprised as such light- 
mindedness was not like me.Or was it in order to win a few more 
moments of peace that I instinctively avoided giving my mind to 
it?Even if, as set forth in Gaber’s report, the affair had seemed un- 
worthy of me, the chief’s insistence on having me, me Moran, 
rather than anybody else, ought to have warned me that it was 
no ordinary one.And instead of bringing to bear upon it without 
delay all the resources of my mind and of my experience, I sat 
dreaming of my breed’s infirmities and the singularities of those 
about me.And yet the poison was already acting on me, the 
poison I had just been given.I stirred restlessly in my arm-chair, 
ran my hands over my face, crossed and uncrossed my legs, and 
so on.The colour and weight of the world were changing already, 
soon I would have to admit I was anxious.I remembered with annoyance the lager I had just absorbed.Would I be granted the body of Christ after a pint of Wallenstein?And if I said nothing?Have you come fasting, my son?He would 
not ask.But God would know, sooner or later.Perhaps he would 
pardon me.But would the eucharist produce the same effect, taken 
on top of beer, however light?I could always try.What was the 
teaching of the Church on the matter?What if I were about to 
commit sacrilege?I decided to suck a few peppermints on the way 
to the presbytery.I got up and went to the kitchen.I asked if Jacques was

It was the first problem to solve, at the outset of each enquiry, 
and I never moved until I had solved it to my satisfaction.Some-

motor-coach, just as sometimes too I left on foot, or on my bicycle, 
silently, in the night.For when you are beset with enemies, as I 
am, you cannot leave on your autocycle, even in the night, without 
being noticed, unless you employ it as an ordinary bicycle, which 
is absurd.But if I was in the habit of first settling this delicate 
question of transport, it was never without having, if not fully 
sifted, at least taken into account the factors on which it depended.For how can you decide on the way of setting out if you do not 
first know where you are going, or at least with what purpose 
you are going there?But in the .present case I was tackling the 
problem of transport with no other preparation than the languid 
cognizance I had taken of Gaber’s report.I would be able to 
recover the minutest details of this report when I wished.But 
I had not yet troubled to do so, I had avoided doing so, saying.The affair is banal.To try and solve the problem of transport 
under such conditions was madness.Yet that was what I was 
doing.I was losing my head already.I liked leaving on my autocycle, I was partial to this way of 
getting about.And in my ignorance of the reasons against it I 
decided to leave on my autocycle.Thus was inscribed, on the 
threshold of the Molloy affair, the fatal pleasure principle.

The sun’s beams shone through the rift in the curtains and 
made visible the sabbath of the motes.I concluded from this that 
the weather was still fine and rejoiced.When you leave on your 
autocycle fine weather is to be preferred.I was wrong, the weather 
was fine no longer, the sky was clouding over, soon it would rain.But for the moment the sun was still shining.It was on this that 
I went, with inconceivable levity, having nothing else to go on.Next I attacked, according to my custom, the capital question 
of the effects to take with me.And on this subject too I should 
have com** , to a quite otiose decision but for my son, who burst 
in wanting to know if he might go out.I controlled myself.He 
was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, a thing I do not 
like to see.But there are nastier gestures, I speak from experience.Out?I said.Where?Out!Vagueness I abhor.I was begin-

botany.Otherwise I could have set him a few teasers, on his

Alone, my hands 
clasped until it seemed my knuckles would crack, I asked the Lord 
for guidance.Without result.That was some consolation.As for 
Father Ambrose, in view of his alacrity to fetch his kit, it seemed 
evident to me he suspected nothing.Or did it amuse him to see 
how far I would go?Or did it tickle him to have me commit a 
sin?I summarised the situation briefly as follows.If knowing I 
have beer taken he gives me the sacrament, his sin, if sin there be, 
is as great as mine.I was therefore risking little.He came back with 
a kind of portable pyx, opened it, and dispatched me without an 
instant’s hesitation.I rose and thanked him warmly.Pah !he said, 
it’s nothing.Now we can talk.I had nothing else to say to him.All I wanted was to return 
home as quickly as possible and stuff myself with stew.My soul 
appeased, I was ravenous.But being slightly in advance of my 
schedule I resigned myself to allowing him eight minutes.They 
seemed endless.He informed me that Mrs Clement, the chemist’s 
wife and herself a highly qualified chemist, had fallen, in her 
laboratory, from the top of a ladder, and broken the neck — .The 
neck!I cried.Of her femur, he said, can’t you let me finish.He 
added that it was bound to happen.

And I, not to be outdone, 
told him how worried I was about my hens, particularly my grey 
hen, which would neither brood nor lay and for the past month 
and more had done nothing but sit with her arse in the dust, from 
morning to night.Like Job, haha, he said.I too said haha.What 
a joy it is to laugh, from time to time, he said.Is it not?I 
said.It is peculiar to man, he said.So I have noticed, I said.102

A brief silence ensued.What do you feed her on?he said.Com 
chiefly, I said.Cooked or raw?he said.Both, I said.I added 
that she ate nothing any more.Nothing !he cried.Next to nothing, 
I said.Animals never laugh, he said.It takes us to find that funny, 
I said.What?he said.It takes us to find that funny, I said loudly.He mused.Christ never laughed either, he said, so far as we know.He looked at me.Can you wonder?I said.There it is, he said.He smiled sadly.She has not the pip, I hope, he said.I said she 
had not, certainly not, anything he liked, but not the pip.He 
meditated..Have you tried bicarbonate?he said.I beg your par- 
don?I said.Bicarbonate of soda, he said, have you tried it?Why 
no, I said.Try it!he cried, flushing with pleasure, have her 
swallow a few dessertspoonfuls, several times a day, for a few 
months.You’ll see, you won’t know her.Summarization models summary:

I said.I had forgotten the chemist was closed.Except in case of 
emergency.And now that little cordial, he said, I declined.This interview with Father Ambrose left me with a painful 
impression.He was still the same dear man, and yet not.I seemed 
to have surprised, on his face, a lack, how shall I say, a lack of 
nobility.The host, it is only fair to say, was lying heavy on my 
stomach.And as I made my way home I felt like one who, having 
swallowed a pain-killer, is first astonished, then indignant, on ob- 
taining no relief.And I was almost ready to suspect Father Am- 
brose, alive to my excesses of the forenoon, of having fobbed me 
off with unconsccrated bread.Or of mental reservation as he pro- 
nounced the magic words.And it was in vile humour that I arrived 
home, in the pelting rain.The stew was a great disappointment.Where are the onions?I cried.Gone to nothing, replied Martha.I rushed into the kitchen, 
to look for the onions I suspected her of having removed from the 
pot, because she knew how much I liked them.I even rummaged 
in the bin.Nothing.She watched me mockingly.I went up to my room again, drew back the curtains on a 
calamitous sky and lay down.I could not understand what was 
happening to me.I found it painful at that period not to under-MOLLO Y

stand.

I tried to pull myself together.In vain.I might have known.My life was running out, I knew not through what breach.I suc- 
ceeded however in dozing off, which is not so easy, when pain is 
speculative.And I was marvelling, in that half-sleep, at my half- 
sleeping, when my son came in, without knocking.Now if there 
is one thing I abhor, it is someone coming into my room, without 
knocking.I might just happen to be masturbating, before my 
cheval-glass.Father with yawning fly and starting eyes, toiling to 
scatter on the ground his joyless seed, that was no sight for a small 
boy.Harshly I recalled him to the proprieties.He protested he 
had knocked twice.If you had knocked a hundred times, I replied, 
it would not give you the right to come in without being invited.But, he said.But what?I said.You told me to be here at half- 
past four, he said.There is something, I said, more important in 
life than punctuality, and that is decorum.Repeat.In that disdain- 
ful mouth my phrase put me to shame.He was soaked.What 
have you been looking at?I said.The liliaceae, papa, he answered.The liliaceae papa!My son had a way of saying papa, when he 
wanted to hurt me, that was very special.Now listen to me, I said.His face took on an expression of anguished attention.We leave 
this evening, I said in substance, on a journey.Put on your school 
suit, the green — .But it’s blue, papa, he said.Summarization models summary:

home?I had not yet told her we were leaving.I would not 
tell her till the last moment, one foot in the stirrup as the 
saying is.I did not wholly trust her.I would call her at the last 
moment and say, Martha, we’re leaving, for one day, two days, 
three days, a week, two weeks, God knows, goodbye.It was im- 
portant to leave her in the dark.Then why had I called her?She 
would have served us dinner in any case, as she did every day.

I had made the mistake of putting myself in her place.That was 
understandable.But to tell her we would dine at home, what a 
blunder.For she knew it already, thought she knew, did know.And as a result of this useless reminder she would sense that some- 
thing was afoot and spy on us, in the hope of learning what it was.First mistake.The second, first in time, was my not having enjoined 
my son to keep what I had told him to himself.Not that this 
would have served any purpose.Nevertheless I should have in- 
sisted on it, as due to myself.I was floundering.I so sly as a rule.I tried to mend matters, saying, A little later than usual, not before 
nine.She turned to go, her simple mind already in a turmoil.I 
am at home to no one, I said.I knew what she would do, she 
would throw a sack over her shoulders and slip off to the bottom 
of the garden.There she would call Hannah, the old cook of the 
Eisner sisters, and they would whisper together for a long time, 
through the railings.Hannah never went out, she did not like 
going out.The Eisner sisters were not bad neighbours, as neigh- 
bours go.They made a little too much music, that was the only 
fault I cr ild find with them.If there is one thing gets on my nerves 
it is music.What I assert, deny, question, in the present, I still can.But mostly I shall use the various tenses of the past.For mostly I 
do not know, it is perhaps no longer so, it is too soon to know, I 
simply do not know, perhaps shall never know.Summarization models summary:

SAMUEL BECKETT
I was thinking of the Eisner sisters.They had an aberdeen called 
Zulu.People called it Zulu.Sometimes, when I was in a good 
humour, I called, Zulu !Little Zulu !and he would come and talk 
to me, through the railings.But I had to be feeling gay.I don’t like 
animals.It’s a strange thing, I don’t like men and I don’t like 
animals.As for God, he is beginning to disgust me.Crouching down 
I would stroke his ears, through the railings, and utter wheedling 
words.He did not realise he disgusted me.He reared up on his 
hind legs and pressed his chest against the bars.Then I could see 
his little- black penis ending in a thin wisp of wetted hair.He felt 
insecure, his hams trembled, his little paws fumbled for purchase, 
one after the other.I too wobbled, squatting on my heels.With my 
free hand I held on to the railings.Perhaps I disgusted him too.I found it hard to tear myself away from these vain thoughts.I wondered, suddenly rebellious, what compelled me to accept 
this commission.But I had already accepted it, I had given my 
word.Too late.Honour.It did not take me long to gild my 
impotence.But could I not postpone our departure to the following day?Or leave alone?Ah shilly-shally.But we would wait till the very 
last moment, a little before midnight.This decision is irrevocable, 
I said.

It was justified moreover by the state of the moon.I did as when I could not sleep.I wandered in my mind, 
slowly, noting every detail of the labyrinth, its paths as familiar 
as those of my garden and yet ever new, as empty as the heart 
could wish or alive with strange encounters.And I heard the distant 
cymbals.There is still time, still time.But there was not, for I 
ceased, all vanished and I tried once more to turn my thoughts 
to the Molloy affair.Unfathomable mind, now beacon, now sea.The agent and the messenger.We agents never took anything 
in writing.Gaber was not an agent in the sense I was.Gaber was 
a messenger.He was therefore entitled to a notebook.A messenger 
had to be possessed of singular qualities, good messengers were 
even more rare than good agents.I who was an excellent agent 
would have made but a sorry messenger.I often regretted it.Gaber 
was protected in numerous ways.He used a code incomprehensible 
to all but himself.Each messenger, before being appointed, had toMOLLOY

the messages he carried.Reflecting on them he arrived at the 
most extravagantly false conclusions.Yes, it was not enough for 
him to understand nothing about them, he had also to believe he 
understood everything about them.This was not all.His memory 
was so bad that his messages had no existence in his head, but 
only in his notebook.He had only to close his notebook to become, 
a moment later, perfectly innocent as to its contents.Summarization models summary:

And when I 
say that he reflected on his messages and drew conclusions from 
them, it was not as we would hdVe reflected on them, you and I, 
the book closed and probably the eyes too, but little by little as he 
read.And when he raised his head and indulged in his commen- 
taries, it was without losing a second, for if he had lost a second 
he would have forgotten everything, both text and gloss.I have 
often wondered if the messengers were not compelled to undergo 
a surgical operation, to induce in them such a degree of amnesia.But I think not.For otherwise their memory was good enough.And I have heard Gaber speak of his childhood, and of his family, 
in extremely plausible terms.To be undecipherable to all but one- 
self, dead without knowing it to the meaning of one’s instructions 
and incapable of remembering them for more than a few seconds, 
these are capacities rarely united in the same individual.No less 
however was demanded of our messengers.And that they were more 
highly esteemed than the agents, whose qualities were sound rather 
than brilliant, is shown by the fact that they received a weekly 
wage of eight pounds as against ours of six pounds ten only, these 
figures being exclusive of bonuses and travelling expenses.And 
when I speak of agents and of messengers in the plural, it is with 
no guarantee of truth.For I had never seen any other messenger 
than Gaber nor any other agent than myself.But I supposed we 
were not the only ones and Gaber must have supposed the same.For the feeling that we were the only ones of our kind would, 
I believe, have been more than we could have borne.

And it must 
have appeared natural, to me, that each agent had his own particular 
messenger, and to Gaber that each messenger had his own particu- 
lar agent.Thus I was able to say to Gaber, Let him give this job 
to someone else, I don’t want it, and Gaber was able to reply.He108

wants it to be you.And these last words, assuming Gaber had 
not invented them especially to annoy me, had perhaps been 
uttered by the chief with the sole purpose of fostering our illusion, 
if it was one.All this is not very clear.That we thought of ourselves as members of a vast organisation 
was doubtless also due to the all too human feeling that trouble 
shared, or is it sorrow, is trouble something, I forget the word.But to me at least, who knew how to listen to the falsetto of reason, 
it was obvious that we were perhaps alone in doing what we did.Yes, in my moments of lucidity I thought it possible.And, to 
keep nothing from you, this lucidity was so acute at times that I 
came even to doubt the existence of Gaber himself.And if I had 
not hastily sunk back into my darkness I might have gone to the 
extreme of conjuring away the chief too and regarding myself as 
solely responsible for my wretched existence.For I knew I was 
wretched, at six pounds ten a week plus bonuses and expenses.And having made away with Gaber and the chief (one Youdi), 
could I have denied myself the pleasure of — you know.But I was 
not made for the great light that devours, a dim lamp was all I had 
been given, and patience without end, to shine it on the empty 
shadows.Summarization models summary:

He did not move.To make assurance doubly sure, I said, we shall 
put the albums in the safe, until our return.He still did not move.Do you hear me?I said.He rose with a bound that knocked over 
his chair and uttered the furious words.Do what you like with 
them!I never want to see them again!Anger should be left to 
cool, in my opinion, crisis to pass, before one operates.I took the 
albums and withdrew, without a word.He had been lacking in 
respect, but this was not the moment to have him admit it.Motion- 
less in the corridor I heard sounds of falling and collision.Another, 
less master of himself than I of myself, would have intervened.But 
it did not positively displease me that my son should give free vent 
to his grief.It purges.Sorrow does more harm when dumb, to my 
mind.The albums under my arm, I returned to my room.

I had 
spared my son a grave temptation, that of putting in his pocket his 
most cherished stamps, in order to gloat on them, during our 
journey.Not that his having one or two stamps about him was 
reprehensible in itself.But it would have been an act of disobed- 
ience.To look at them he would have had to hide from his father.And when he had lost them, as he inevitably would, he would have 
been driven to lie, to account for their disappearance.No, if he 
could not really bear to be parted from the gems of his collection, 
it would have been better for him to take the entire album.For 
an album is less readily lost than a stamp.But I was a better judge 
than he of what he could and could not.For I knew what he did 
not yet know, among other things, that this ordeal would be of 
profit to him.Sollst entbehren, that was the lesson I desired to 
impress upon him, while he was still young and tender.Magic 
words which I had never dreamt, until my fifteenth year, could be 
coupled together.And should this undertaking make me odious 
in his eyes and not only me, but the very idea of fatherhood, I 
would pursue it 'none the less, with everything in my power.The 
thought that between my death and his own, ceasing for an 
instant from heaping curses on my memory, he might wonder, in 
a flash, whether I had not been right, that was enough for me, that 
repaid me for all the trouble I had taken and was still to take.He

the most of them.Because after dinner I drowse.I took off my 
coat and shoes, opened my trousers and got in between the sheets.It is lying down, in the warmth, in the gloom, that I best pierce 
the outer turmoil’s veil, discern my quarry, sense what course to 
follow, find peace in another’s ludicrous distress.Far from the 
world, its clamours, frenzies, bitterness and dingy light, I pass 
judgement on it and on those, 4ike me, who are plunged in it 
beyond recall, and on him who has need of me to be delivered, 
who cannot deliver myself.All is dark, but with that simple dark-

their places masses move, stark as laws.Masses of what?One 
does not ask.There somewhere man is too, vast conglomerate of 
all of nature’s kingdoms, as lonely and as bound.And in that block 
the prey is lodged and thinks himself a being apart.Anyone would 
serve.But I am paid to seek.I arrive, he comes away.His life has 
been nothing but a waiting for this, to see himself preferred, to 
fancy himself damned, blessed, to fancy himself everyman, 
above all others.Warmth, gloom, smells of my bed, such is the 
effect they sometimes have on me.I get up, go out, and everything 
is changed.

The blood drains from my head, the noise of things 
bursting, merging, avoiding one another, assails me on all sides, 
my eyes search in vain for two things alike, each pinpoint of 
skin screams a different message, I drown in the spray of phe- 
nomena.It is at the mercy of these sensations, which happily I 
know to be illusory, that I have to live and work.It is thanks to 
them I find myself a meaning.So he whom a sudden pain awakes.He stiffens, ceases to breathe, waits, says.It’s a bad dream, or, it’s 
a touch of neuralgia, breathes again, sleeps again, still trembling.And yet J t is not unpleasant, before setting to work, to steep oneself 
again in this slow and massive world, where all things move with 
the ponderous sullenness of oxen, patiently through the immemorial 
ways, and where of course no investigation would be possible.But

to me perhaps the more correct.But barely.What I heard, in my

ending, whereas the others left it cold.But since Gaber had said

unable to conceive what had brought him to such a pass, I was 
no better able to conceive how, left to his own resources, he could

Merging and summarizing: 
That a man like me, so meticulous and calm in the main, so 
patiently turned towards the outer world as towards the lesser 
evil, creature of his house, of his garden, of his few poor posses- 
sions, discharging faithfully and ably a revolting function, reining 
back his thoughts within the limits of the calculable so great is 
his horror of fancy, that a man so contrived, for I was a contri- 
vance, should let himself be haunted and possessed by chimeras, 
this ought to have seemed strange to me and been a warning to 
me to have a care, in my own interest.Nothing of the kind.I saw 
it only as the weakness of a solitary, a weakness admittedly to be 
deplored, but which had to be indulged in if I wished to remain a 
solitary, and I did, I clung to that, with as little enthusiasm as toMOLLOY

my hens or to my faith, but no less lucidly.Besides this took up 
very little room in the inenarrable contraption I called my life, 
jeopardised it as little as my dreams and was as soon forgotten.Don’t wait to be hunted to hide, that was always my motto.And 
if I had to tell the story of my life I should not so much as allude 
to these apparitions, and least of all to that of the unfortunate 
Molloy.For his was a poor thing, compared to others.But images of this kind the will cannot revive without doing 
them violence.Much of what they had it takes away, much they 
never had it foists upon them.

And the Molloy I brought to light, 
that memorable August Sunday, was certainly not the true denizen 
of my dark places, for it was not his hour.But so far as the essen- 
tial features were concerned, I was easy in my mind, the like- 
ness was there.And the discrepancy could have been still greater 
for all I cared.For what I was doing I was doing neither for Molloy, 
who mattered nothing to me, nor for myself, of whom I despaired, 
but on behalf of a cause which, while having need of us to be 
accomplished, was in its essence anonymous, and would subsist, 
haunting the minds of men, when its miserable artisans should be 
no more.It will not be said, I think, that I did not take my work 
to heart.But rather, tenderly.Ah those old craftsmen, their race 
is extinct and the mould broken.Two remarks.Between the Molloy T stalked within me thus and the true 
Molloy, after whom I was so soon to be in full cry, over hill and 
dale, the resemblance cannot have been great.I was annexing perhaps already, without my knowing it, to my 
private Molloy, elements of the Molloy described by Gaber.The fact was there were three, no, four Molloys.He that 
inhabited me, my caricature of same, Gaber's and the man of flesh 
and blood somewhere awaiting me.To these I would add Youdi’s 
were it r^t for Gaber’s corpse fidelity to the letter of his messages.Bad reasoning.Summarization models summary:

For could it seriously be supposed that Youdi had 
confided to Gaber all he knew, or thought he knew (all one to 
Youdi) about his protege?Assuredly not.He had only revealed 
what he deemed of relevance for the prompt and proper execution 
of his orders.I will therefore add a fifth Molloy, that of Youdi.116
SAMUEL BECKETT
But would not this fifth Molloy necessarily coincide with the fourth, 
the real one as the saying is, him dogged by his shadow?I would 
have given a lot to know.There were others too, of course.But 
let us leave it at that, if you don’t mind, the party is big enough.And let us not meddle either with the question as to how far these 
five Molloys were constant and how far subject to variation.For 
there was this about Youdi, that he changed his mind with great 
facility.That makes three remarks.I had only anticipated two.The ice thus broken, I felt equal to facing Gaber’s report and 
getting down to the official facts.It seemed as if the enquiry were 
about to start at last.It was then that the sound of a gong, struck with violence, 
filled the house.True enough, it was nine o’clock.I got up, adjusted 
my clothes and hurried down.To give notice that the soup was in, 
nay, that it had begun to coagulate, was always for Martha a little 
triumph and a great satisfaction.For as a rule I was at table, my 
napkin tucked into my collar, crumbling the bread, fiddling with 
the cover, playing with the knife-rest, waiting to be served, a few 
minutes before the appointed hour.

gesture.Tell him to come down at once, I said.The soup before 
me had stopped steaming.Had it ever steamed?She came back.He won’t come down, she said.I laid down my spoon.Tell me, 
Martha, I said, what is this preparation?She named it.Have I 
had it before?I said.She assured me I had.I then made a joke 
which pleased me enormously, I laughed so much I began to hiccup.It was lost on Martha who stared at me dazedly.Tell him to come 
down, I said at last.What?said Martha.I repeated my phrase.She still looked genuinely perplexed.There are three of us in this 
charming home, I said, you, my son and finally myself.What I said 
was.Tell him to come down.But he’s sick, said Martha.Were he 
dying, I said, down he must come.Anger led me sometimes to 
slight excesses of language.I could not regret them.It seemed to 
me that all language was an excess of language.Naturally I con- 
fessed them.I was short of sins.Jacques was scarlet in the face.Eat your soup, I said, and tellMOLLOY

we had the cold remains of a fowl, chicken, duck, goose, turkey, 
I can think of no other fowl, from Saturday evening.I have always

for their little ways, who likes them in a word and is liked by 
them in return.Shepherd’s pie, said Martha.I tasted it, from the

word, this rather long and difficult sentence, which contained 
no fewer than three or four imperatives.As he went out, having 
presumably understood the gist of it, I added jocosely, You know 
which mouth to put it in?I was not averse, in conversation with 
my son, to jests of doubtful taste, in the interests of his education.Those whose pungency he could not fully savour at the time, and 
they must have been many, he could reflect on at his leisure or 
seek in company with his little friends to interpret as best he might.Which was in itself an excellent exercise.And at the same time I 
inclined his young mind towards that most fruitful of dispositions, 
horror of the body and its functions.But I had turned my phrase 
badly, mouth was not the word I should have used.It was while 
examining the shepherd’s pie more narrowly that I had this after- 
thought.I lifted the crust with my spoon and looked inside.I 
probed it with my fork.I called Martha and said.His dog wouldn’t 
touch it.I thought with a smile of my desk which had only six 
drawers in all and for all, three on each side of the space where 
I put my legs.Since your dinner is uneatable, I said, be good 
enough to prepare a packet of sandwiches, with the chicken you

you get for having a minute-thermometer.He handed it to me.Did 
you have time to wipe it?I said.

the providential hinderance for which I could not be held res-

going to expose myself to thunderbolts which might be fatal, simply 
because my son had the gripes.If he fell seriously ill on the way, 
it would be another matter.It was not for nothing I had studied 
the old testament.Have you shat, my child, I said gently.I’ve 
tried, he said.Do you want to, I said.Yes, he said.But nothing 
comes, I said.No, he said.A little wind, I said.Yes, he said.Suddenly I remembered Father Ambrose’s cigar.I lit it.We’ll see 
what we can do, I said, getting up.We went upstairs.I gave him 
an enema, with salt water.He struggled, but not for long.I with- 
drew the nozzle.Try and hold it, I said, don’t stay sitting on the 
pot, lie flat on your stomach.We were in the bathroom.He lay

What a day.I looked at the ash on my cigar.It was firm 
and blue.I sat down on the edge of the bath.The porcelain, the 
mirrors, the chromium, instilled a great peace within me.At least I 
suppose it was they.It wasn’t a great peace in any case.I got up, 
laid down my cigar and brushed my incisors.I also brushed the 
back gums.I looked at myself, puffing out my lips which normally 
recede into my mouth.What do I look like?I said.The sight of 
my moustache, as always, annoyed me.It wasn’t quite right.It 
suited me, without a moustache I was inconceivable.But it 
ought to have suited me better.A slight change in the cut 
would have sufficed.But what change ?Was there too much 
of it, not enough?Now, I said, without ceasing to inspect myself, 
get back on the pot and strain.Was it not rather the colour?A 
noise as of a waste recalled me to less elevated preoccupations.He 
stood up trembling all over.We bent together over the pot which 
at length I took by the handle and tilted from side to side.A few 
fibrou: shreds floated in the yellow liquid.How can you hope to 
shit, i said, when you’ve nothing in your stomach?He protested 
he had had his lunch.You ate nothing, I said.He said no more.I had scored a hit.You forget we are leaving in an hour or so, I 
said.I can’t, he said.So that, I pursued, you will have to eat some- 
thing.

An acute pain shot through my knee.What’s the matter.120

papa?he said.I let myself fall on the stool, pulled up the leg of 
my trousers and examined my knee, flexing and unflexing it.Quick 
the iodex, I said.You’re sitting on it, he said.I stood up and the 
leg of my trousers fell down over my ankle.This inertia of things 
is enough to drive one literally insane.I let out a bellow which must 
have been heard by the Eisner sisters.They stop reading, raise 
their heads, look at each other, listen.Nothing more.Just another 
cry in the night.Two old hands, veined, ringed, seek each other, 
clasp.I pulled up the leg of my trousers again, rolled it in a fury 
round my thigh, raised the lid of the stool, took out the iodex and 
rubbed it into my knee.The knee is full of little loose bones.Let 
it soak well in, said my son.He would pay for that later on.When 
I had finished I put everything back in place, rolled down the leg 
of my trousers, sat down on the stool again and listened.Nothing 
more.Unless you’d like to try a real emetic, I said, as if nothing 
had happened.I’m tired, he said.You go and lie down, I said.I’ll 
bring you something nice and light in bed, you’ll have a little sleep 
and then we’ll leave together.I drew him to me.What do you say 
to that?I said.He said to it.Yes papa.Did he love me then as

sack.I have no idea, I said.Then almost in the same breath, seeing 
her so old, worse than old, ageing, so sad and solitary in her ever- 
lasting corner.There, there, it won’t be long.

And I advised her, 
in terms for me warm, to have a good rest while I was away and 
a good time visiting her friends and receiving them.Stint neither 
tea nor sugar, I said, and if by any chance you should happen to 
need money, apply to Mr Savory.I carried this sudden cordiality 
so far as to shake her by the hand, which she hastily wiped, as 
soon as she grasped my intention, on her apron.When I had 
finished shaking it, that flabby red hand, I did not let it go.But I 
took one finger between the tips of mine, drew it towards me and 
gazed at it.And had I had any tears to shed I should have shed 
them then, in torrents, for hours.She must have wondered if I was 
not on the point of making an attempt on her virtue.I gave her 
back her hand, took the sandwiches and left her.Martha had been a long time in my service.I was often away

offhandedly, even when a prolonged absence was to be feared,

and clearly stated, would deal a blow to my authority which it was 
in no condition to sustain.I did so with sorrow.My son was al- 
ready sleeping.I woke him.He ate and drank, grimacing with 
disgust.That was all the thanks I got.I waited until the last drop, 
the last crumb, had disappeared.He turned to the wall and I 
tucked him in.I was within a hair’s breadth of kissing him.Neither 
he nor I had uttered a word.We had no further need of words, 
for the time being.Besides my son rarely spoke to me unless I 
spoke to him.And when I did so he answered but lamely and as 
it were with reluctance.And yet with his little friends, when he 
thought I was out of the way, he was incredibly voluble.That my 
presence had the effect of dampening this disposition was far from 
displeasing me.

Not one person in a hundred knows how to be silent 
and listen, no, nor even to conceive what such a thing means.Yet 
only then can you detect, beyond the fatuous clamour, the silence 
of which the universe is made.I desired this advantage for my son.And that he should hold aloof from those who pride themselves 
on their eagle gaze.I had not struggled, toiled, suffered, made good, 
lived like a Hottentot, so that my son should do the same.I tip- 
toed out.I quite enjoyed playing my parts through to the bitter end.Since in this way I shirked the issue, have I to apologise for 
saying so?I let fall this suggestion for what it is worth.And per- 
functorily.For in describing this day I am once more he who suf- 
fered it, who crammed it full of futile anxious life, with no other 
purpose than his own stultification and the means of not doing what 
he had to do.And as then my thoughts would have none of Molloy, 
so tonight my pen.This confession has been preying on my mind 
for some time past.To have made it gives me no relief.I reflected with bitter satisfaction that if my son lay down and 
died by the wayside, it would be none of my doing.To every man 
his own responsibilities.I know of some they do not keep awake.I said.There is something in this house tying my hands.A 
man like me cannot forget, in his evasions, what it is he evades.I 
went down to the garden and moved about in the almost total 
darkness.Summarization models summary:

If I had not known my garden so well I would have 
blundered into my shrubberies, or my bee-hives.My cigar had gone 
Out unnoticed.I shook it and put it in my pooket, intending toMOLLO Y

discard it in the ash-tray, or in the waste-paper basket, later on.But the next day, far from Turdy, I found it in my pocket and 
indeed not without satisfaction.For I was able to get a few more 
puffs out of it.To discover the cold cigar between my teeth, to 
spit it out, to search for it in the dark, to pick it up, to wonder 
what I should do with it, to shake it needlessly and put it in my 
pocket, to conjure up the ash-tray and the waste-paper basket, 
these were merely the principal stages of a sequence which I 
spun out for a quarter of an hour at least.Others concerned 
the dog Zulu, the perfumes Sharpened tenfold by the rain 
and whose sources I amused myself exploring, in my head and 
with my hands, a neighbour’s light, another’s noise, and so on.My son’s window was faintly lit.He liked sleeping with a night-light 
beside him.I sometimes felt it was wrong of me to let him humour 
this weakness.Until quite recently he could not sleep unless he had 
his woolly bear to hug.When he had forgotten the bear (Baby Jack) 
I would forbid the night-light.What would I have done that day 
without my son to distract me?My duty perhaps.

Finding my spirits as low in the garden as in the house, I 
turned to go in, saying to myself it was one of two things, either 
my house had nothing to do with the kind of nothingness in the 
midst of which I stumbled or else the whole of my little property 
was to blame.To adopt this latter hypothesis was to condone what 
I had done and, in advance, what I was to do, pending my depar- 
ture.It brought me a semblance of pardon and a brief moment of 
factitious freedom.I therefore adopted it.From a distance the kitchen had seemed to be in darkness.And in a sense it was.But in another sense it was not.For gluing 
my eyes to the window-pane I discerned a faint reddish glow which 
could not have come from the oven, for I had no oven, but a simple 
gas-stove.An oven if you like, but a gas-oven.That is to say there 
was a ;eal oven too in the kitchen, but out of service.I’m sorry, 
but t.iere it is, in a house without a gas-oven I would not have felt 
easy.In the night, interrupting my prowl, I like to go up to a 
window, lit or unlit, and look into the room, to see what is going 
on.I cover my face with my hands and peer through my fingers.I have terrified more than one neighbour in this way.He rushes124

In a house without a gas-oven, I had no oven but a simple gas-stove, which I used to heat the house.
During this time, my son liked sleeping with a night-light, and he could not sleep unless he had his woolly bear to hug.
When he had forgotten the bear (Baby Jack), I would forbid the night-lights.

But the gloaming in the kitchen was of another 
kind and came from the night-light with the red chimney which, 
in Martha’s room, adjoining the kitchen, burned eternally at the 
feet of a litle Virgin carved in wood, hanging on the wall.Weary 
of rocking herself she had gone in and lain down on her bed, leav- 
ing the door of her room open so as to miss none of the sounds 
in the house.But perhaps she had gone to sleep.I went upstairs again.I stopped at my son’s door.I stooped 
and applied my ear to the keyhole.Some apply the eye, I the ear, 
to keyholes.I heard nothing, to my great surprise.For my son slept 
noisily, with open mouth.I took good care not to open the door.For this silence was of a nature to occupy my mind, for some little 
time.I went to my room.It was then the unheard of sight was to be seen of Moran 
making ready to go without knowing where he was going, having 
consulted neither map nor time-table, considered neither itinerary 
nor halt, heedless of the weather outlook, with only the vaguest 
notion of the outfit he would need, the time the expedition was 
likely to take, the money he would require and even the very 
nature of the work to be done and consequently the means to be 
employed.And yet there I was whistling away while I stuffed into 
my haversack a minimum of effects, similar to those I had recom- 
mended to my son.I put on my old pepper-and-salt shooting-suit 
with the knee-breeches, stockings to match and a pair of stout black 
boots.

I bent down, my hands on my buttocks, and looked at my 
legs.Knock-kneed and skeleton thin they made a poor show in 
this accoutrement, unknown locally I may add.But when I left at 
night, for a distant place, I wore it with pleasure, for the sake of 
comfort, though I looked a sight.All I needed was a butterfly-net 
to have vaguely the air of a country schoolmaster on convalescent 
leave.The heavy glittering black boots, which seemed to implore a 
pair of navy-blue serge trousers, gave the finishing blow to this 
get-up which otherwise might have appeared, to the uninformed, an 
example of well-bred bad taste.On my heed, after mature hesita-MOLLOY

tion, I decided to wear my straw boater, yellowed by the rain.It 
had lost its band, which gave it an appearance of inordinate height 
I was tempted to take my black cloak, but finally rejected it in 
favour of a heavy massive-handled winter umbrella.The cloak is 
a serviceable garment and I had more than one.It leaves great 
freedom of movement to the arms and at the same time conceals 
them.And there are times when a cloak is so to speak indispensable.But the umbrella too has great merits.And if it had been winter, or 
even autumn, instead of summer, I might have taken both.I had 
already done so, with most gratifying results.Dressed thus I could hardly hope to pass unseen.I did not 
wish to.Conspicuousness is the A B C of my profession.To call 
forth feelings of pity and indulgence, to be the butt of jeers and 
hilarity, is indispensable.Summarization models summary:

on a milestone in the dark, my legs crossed, one hand on my thigh, 
my elbow in that hand, my chin cupped in the other, my eyes fixed 
on the earth as on a chessboard; coldly hatching my plans, for the

forgot that my son would be at my side, restless, plaintive, whin-

of my breeches in this case.A massive chain, attached to my braces, 
prevents me from losing them.This chain, four or five times longer

threw himself down on the floor and rolled about, screaming with 
anger and defiance.The fun was beginning already.This disgust- 
ing exhibition left me no choice but to use my umbrella, holding 
it by the end with both hands.But a word on the subject of my 
boater, before I forget.Two holes were bored in the brim, one on 
either side of course, I had bored them myself, with my little 
gimlet.And in these holes I had secured the ends of an elastic 
long enough to pass under my chin, under my jaws rather, but not 
too long, for it had to hold fast, under my jaws rather.

In this way, 
however great my exertions, my boater stayed in its place, which 
was on my head.Shame on you, I cried, you ill-bred little pig!I would get angry if I were not careful.And anger is a luxury I 
cannot afford.For then I go blind, blood veils my eyes and I hear 
what the great Gustave heard, the benches creaking in the court of 
assizes.Oh it is not without scathe that one is gentle, courteous, 
reasonable, patient, day after day, year after year.I threw down 
my umbrella and ran from the room.On the stairs I met Martha 
coming up, capless, dishevelled, her clothes in disorder.What’s 
going on?she cried.I looked at her.She went back to her kitchen.Trembling I hastened to the shed, seized my axe, went into the 
yard and began hacking madly at an old chopping-block that lay 
there and on which in winter, tranquilly, I split my logs.Finally 
the blade sank into it so deeply that I could not get it out.The 
efforts I made to do so brought me, with exhaustion, calm.I went 
upstairs again.My son was dressing.He was crying.Everybody was 
crying.I helped him put on his knapsack.I told him not to forget 
his raincoat.He began to put it in his knapsack.I told him to carry 
it over his arm, for the moment.It was nearly midnight.I picked 
up my umbrella.Intact.Get on, I said.He went out of the room 
which I paused for a moment to survey, before I followed him.It

few dim stars.I offered my face to the black mass of fragrant 
vegetation that was mine and with which I could do as I pleased 
and never be gainsaid.It was full of songbirds, their heads under 
their wings, fearing nothing, for they knew me.My trees, my bushes, 
my flower-beds, my tiny lawns, I used to think I loved them.If I 
sometimes cut a branch, a flower, it was solely for their good, that 
they might increase in strength and happiness.And I never did it 
without a pang.

Indeed if the truth were known, I did not do it 
at all, I got Christy to do it.I grew no vegetables.Not far off was 
the hen-house.When I said I had turkeys, and so on, I lied.All 
I had was a few hens.My grey hen was there, not on the perch with 
the others, but on the ground, in a corner, in the dust, at the mercy 
of the rats.The cock no longer sought her out to tread her angrily.The day was at hand, if she did not take a turn for the better, when 
the other hens would join forces and tear her to pieces, with their 
beaks and claws.All was silent.I have an extremely sensitive ear.Yet I have no ear for music.I could just hear that adorable murmur 
of tiny feet, of quivering feathers and feeble, smothered clucking 
that hen-houses make at night and that dies down long before dawn.How often I had listened to it, entranced, in the evening, saying.Tomorrow I am free.And so I turned again a last time towards 
my little all, before I left it, in the hope of keeping it.In the lane, having locked the wicket-gate, I said to my son.Left.I had long since given up going for walks with my son, though 
I sometimes longed to do so.The least outing with him was torture, 
he lost his way so easily.Yet when alone he seemed to know all the 
short cuts.When I sent him to the grocer’s, or to Mrs Clement’s, 
or even further afield, on the road to V for grain, he was back in 
half the time I would have taken for the journey myself, and with- 
out having run.Summarization models summary:

I wanted him to walk like his father, with rapid steps, his head 
up, breathing even and economical, his arms swinging, looking 
neither to left nor right, apparently oblivious to everything and in 
reality missing nothing.But with me he invariably took the wrong 
turn, a crossing or a simple corner was all he needed to stray from 
the right road, it of my election.I do not think he did this on 
purpose.But leaving everything to me he did not heed what he 
was doing, or look where he was going, and went on mechanically 
plunged in a kind of dream.It was as though he let himself be 
sucked in out of sight by every opening that offered.So that we had 
got into the habit of taking our walks separately.And the only 
walk we regularly took together was that which led us, every Sun- 
day, from home to church and, mass over, from church to home.Caught up then in the slow tide of the faithful my son was not 
alone with me.But he was part of that docile herd going yet again 
to thank God for his goodness and to implore his mercy and for- 
giveness, and then returning, their souls made easy, to other grati- 
fications.I waited for him to come back, then spoke the words calculated 
to settle this matter once and for all.Get behind me, I said, and 
keep behind me.This solution had its points, from several points 
of view.But was he capable of keeping behind me?

Would not 
the time be bound to come when he would raise his head and find 
himself alone, in a strange place, and when I, waking from my 
reverie, would turn and find him gone?I toyed briefly with the 
idea of attaching him to me by means of a long rope, its two ends 
tied about our waists.There are various ways of attracting attention 
and I was not sure that this was one of the good ones.And he 
might have undone his knots in silence and escaped, leaving me to 
go on my way alone, followed by a long rope trailing in the dust, 
like a burgess of Calais.Until such time as the rope, catching on 
some fixed or heavy object, should stop me dead in my stride.We 
should have needed, not the soft silent rope, but a chain, which was 
not to be dreamt of.And yet I did dream of it, for an instant I 
amused myself dreaming of it, imagining myself in a world less ill 
contrived and wondering how, having nothing more than a simple 
chain, without collar or band or gyves or fetters of any kind, I130

could chain my son to me in such a way as to prevent him from 
ever shaking me off again.It was a simple problem of toils and 
knots and I could have solved it at a pinch.But already I was 
called elsewhere by the image of my son no longer behind me, but 
before me.Thus in the rear I could keep my eye on him and inter-

But apart from 
having other parts to play, during this expedition, than those of 
keeper and sick-nurse, the prospect was more than I could bear of 
being unable to move a step without having before my eyes my 
son’s sullen, plump body.Come, here !I cried.For on hearing me 
say we were to go to the left he had gone to the left, as if his 
dearest wish was to infuriate me.Slumped over my umbrella, my 
head sunk as beneath a malediction, the fingers of my free hand 
between two slats of the wicket, I no more stirred than if I had 
been of stone.So he came back a second time.I tell you to keep 
behind me and you go before me, I said.It was the summer holidays.His school cap was green with 
initials and a boar’s head, or a deer’s, in gold braid on the front.It 
lay plumb on his big blond skull as precise as a lid on a pot.There 
is something about this strict sit of hats and caps that never fails 
to exasperate me.As for his raincoat, instead of carrying it folded 
over his arm, or flung across his shoulder, as I had told him, he 
had rolled it in a ball and was holding it with both hands, on his 
belly.There he was before me, his big feet splayed, his knees sag- 
ging, his stomach sticking out, his chest sunk, his chin in the air, 
his mouth open, in the attitude of a veritable half-wit.I myself must 
have looked as if only the support of my umbrella and the wicket 
were keeping me from falling.

I managed finally to articulate, Are 
you capable of following me?He did not answer.But I seized his 
thoughts as clearly as if he had spoken them, namely.And you, are 
you capable of leading me?Midnight struck, from the steeple of my 
beloved church.It did not matter.I was gone from home.I sought 
in my mind, where all I need is to be found, what treasured pos- 
session he was likely to have about him.I hope, I said, you have 
not forgotten your scout-knife, we might need it.This knife com- 
prised, apart from the five or six indispensable blades, a cork-screw, 
a tin-opener, a punch, a screw-driver, a claw, a gouge for removingMOLLOY

stones from hooves and I know not what other futilities besides.I had given it to him myself, on the occasion of his first first prize 
for history and geography, subjects which, at the school he at- 
tended, were for obscure reasons regarded as inseparable.The 
veriest dunce when it came to literature and the so-called exact 
sciences, he had no equal for the dates of battles, revolutions, 
restorations and other exploits of the human race, in its slow ascen- 
sion towards the light, and for the configuration of frontiers and 
the heights of mountain peaks.He deserved his scout-knife.Don’t 
tell me you’ve left it behind, I said.Not likely, he said, with pride 
and satisfaction, tapping his pocket.Then give it to me, I said.Naturally he did not answer.Prompt obedience was contrary to 
his habits.Give me that knife !I cried.He gave it to me.Summarization models summary:

What could 
he do, alone with me in the night that tells no tales?It was for his 
own good, to save him from getting lost.For where a scout’s knife 
is, there will his heart be also, unless he can afford to buy another, 
which was not the case with my son.For he never had any money in 
his pocket, not needing it.But every penny he received, and he did 
not receive many, he deposited first in his savings-box, then in the 
savings-bank, where they were entered in a book that remained in 
my possession.He would doubtless at that moment with pleasure 
have cut my throat, with that selfsame knife I was putting so 
placidly in my pocket.But he was still a little on the young side, 
my son, a little on the soft side, for the great deeds of vengeance.But time was on his side and he consoled himself perhaps with that 
thought, foolish though he was.Be that as it may, he kept back 
his tears, for which I was obliged to him.I straightened myself 
and laid my hand on his shoulder, saying, Patience, my child, 
patience.The awful thing in affairs of this kind is that when you 
have the will you do not have the way, and vice versa.But of that 
my unfortunate son could as yet have no suspicion, he must have 
thought that the rage which distorted his features and made him 
tremble would never leave him till the day he could vent it as it 
deserved.And not even then.Yes, he must have felt his soul the 
soul of a pocket Monte Cristo, with whose antics as adumbrated 
in the Schoolboys’ Classics he was needless to say familiar.

befell us, me and my son, together and singly, before we came to

me.All is tedious, in this relation that is forced upon me.But I 
shall conduct it in my own way, up to a point.And if it has not 
the good fortune to give satisfaction, to my employer, if there are 
passages, that give offence to him and to his colleagues, then so 
much the worse for us all, for them all, for there is no worse for me.That is to say, I have not enough imagination to imagine it.And 
yet I have more than before.And if I submit to this paltry scriven- 
ing which is not of my province, it is for reasons very different from 
those that might be supposed.I am still obeying orders, if you like, 
but no longer out of fear.No, I am still afraid, but simply from 
force of habit.And the voice I listen to needs no Gaber to make 
it heard.For it is within me and exhorts me to continue to the end 
the faithful servant I have always been, of a cause that is not mine, 
and patiently fulfil in all its bitterness my calamitous part, as it was 
my will, when I had a will, that others should.And this with hatred

Yes, it is 
rather an ambiguous voice and not always easy to follow, in its 
reasonings and decrees.But I follow it none the less, more or less, 
I follow it in this sense, that I know what it means, and in this 
sense, that I do what it tells me.And I do not think there are many 
voices of which as much may be said.And I feel I shall follow 
it from this day forth, no matter what it commands.And when it 
ceases, leaving me in doubt and darkness, I shall wait for it to come 
back, and do nothing, even though the whole world, through the 
channel of its innumerable authorities speaking with one accord, 
should enjoin upon me this and that, under pain of unspeakable 
punishments.But this evening, this morning, I have drunk a little 
more than usual and tomorrow I may be of a different mind.It 
also tells me, this voice I am only just beginning to know, that the 
memory of this work brought scrupulously to a close will help me 
to endure the long anguish of vagrancy and freedom.Does thisMOLLO Y

mean I shall one day be banished from my house, from my garden, 
lose my trees, my lawns, my birds of which the least is known to 
me and the way all its own it has of singing, of flying, of com- 
ing up to me or fleeing at my coming, lose and be banished from 
the absurd comforts of my home where all is snug and neat and 
all those things at hand without which I could not bear being a 
man, where my enemies cannot reach me, which it was my life’s 
work to build, to adorn, to perfect, to keep?

I am too old to lose 
all this, and begin again, I am too old!Quiet Moran, quiet.No 
emotion, please.I was saying I would not relate all the vicissitudes of the 
journey from my country to Molloy’s, for the simple reason that 
I do not intend to.And in writing these lines I know in what 
danger I am of offending him whose favour I know 1 should court, 
now more than ever.But I write them all the same, and with a 
firm hand weaving inexorably back and forth and devouring my 
page with the indifference of a shuttle.But some 1 shall relate 
briefly, because that seems to me desirable, and in order to give 
some idea of the methods of my full maturity.But before coming 
to that I shall say what little I knew, on leaving my home, about 
the Molloy country, so different from my own.For it is one of 
the features of this penance that I may not pass over what is over 
and straightway come to the heart of the matter.But that must 
again be unknown to me which is no longer so and that again 
fondly believed which then I fondly believed, at my setting out.And 
if I occasionally break this rule, it is only over details of little im- 
portance.And in the main I observe it.And with such zeal that

I mean in relation to mine, less bleak, and comprised a settlement, 
dignified by some with the name of market-town, by others re- 
garded as no more than- a village, and the surrounding country.This market-town, or village, was, I hasten to say, called Bally, 
and represented, with its dependent lands, a surface area of five 
or six square miles at the most.

In modern countries this is what 
I think is called a commune, or a canton, I forget, but there exists 
with us no abstract and generic term for such territorial subdivisions.And to express them we have another system, of singular beauty 
and simplicity, which consists in saying Bally (since we are talking 
of Bally) when you mean Bally and Ballyba when you mean Bally 
plus its domains and Ballybaba when you mean the domains ex- 
clusive of Bally itself.I myself for example lived, and come to 
think of it still live, in Turdy, hub of Turdyba.And in the evening, 
when I went for a stroll, in the country outside Turdy, to get a 
breath of fresh air, it was the fresh air of Turdybaba that I got, 
and no other.Ballybaba, in spite of its limited range, could boast of a cer- 
tain diversity.Pastures so-called, a little bogland, a few copses and, 
as you neared its confines, undulating and almost smiling aspects, 
as if Ballybaba was glad to go no further.But the principal beauty of this region was a kind of strangled 
creek which the slow grey tides emptied and filled, emptied and 
filled.And the people came flocking from the town, unromantic 
people, to admire this spectacle.Some said.There is nothing more 
beautiful than these wet sands.Others, High tide is the best time 
to see the creek of Ballyba.How lovely then that leaden water.MOLLO Y

But all were 
agreed, like the inhabitants of Blackpool, that their town was on 
the sea.And they had Bally-on-Sea printed on their notepaper.The population of Ballyba was small.I confess this thought 
gave me great satisfaction.The land did not lend itself to cultiva- 
tion.No sooner did a tilth, or a meadow, begin to be sizeable than 
it fell foul of a sacred grove or a stretch of marsh from which 
nothing could be obtained beyond a little inferior turf or scraps 
of bogoak used for making amuldts, paper-knives, napkin-rings, 
rosaries and other knick-knacks.Martha’s madonna, for example, 
came from Ballyba.The pastures, in spite of the torrential rains, 
were exceedingly meagre and strewn with boulders.Here only 
quitchweed grew in abundance, and a curious bitter blue grass fatal 
to cows and horses, though tolerated apparently by the ass, the goat 
and the black sheep.What then was the source of Ballyba’s pros- 
perity?I’ll tell you.No, I’ll tell you nothing.Nothing.That then is a part of what I thought I knew about Ballyba 
when I left home.I wonder if I was not confusing it with some 
other place.Some twenty paces from my wicket-gate the lane skirts the 
graveyard wall.The lane descends, the wall rises, higher and higher.Soon you are faring below the dead.It is there I have my plot in 
perpetuity.As long as the earth endures that spot is mine, in 
theory.Sometimes I went and looked at my grave.

The stone was 
up already.It was a simple Latin cross, white.I wanted to have my 
name put on it, with the here lies and the date of my birth.Then 
all it would have wanted was the date of my death.They would 
not let me.Sometimes I smiled, as if I were dead already.We walked for several days, by sequestered ways.I did not 
want to be seen on the highways.Thf first day I found the butt of Father Ambrose’s cigar.Not 
only had I not thrown it away, in the ash-tray, in the waste-paper 
basket, but I had put it in my pocket, when changing my suit.That 
had happened unbeknown to me.I looked at it in astonishment, 
lit it, took a few puffs, threw it away.This was the outstanding 
event of the first day.136

I showed my son how to use his pocket-compass.This gave 
him great pleasure.He was behaving well, better than I had hoped.On the third day I gave him back his knife.The weather was kind.We easily managed our ten miles a 
day.We slept in the open.Safety first.I showed my son how to make a shelter out of branches.He 
was in the scouts, but knew nothing.Yes, he knew how to make 
a camp fire.At every halt he implored me to let him exercise this 
talent.1 saw no point in doing so.We lived on tinned food which I sent him to get in the villages.He was that much use to me.We drank the water to the streams.All these precautions were assuredly useless.One day in a field

seen.Having greeted me, he asked where we were going.It must 
have been his field.I replied that wc were going home.Fortunately 
we had not yet left it far behind.Then he asked me where we had 
been.Perhaps one of his cows had been stolen, or one of his pigs.Out walking, I said.I’d give you a lift and welcome, he said, but 
I won’t be leaving till night.Oh how very unfortunate, I said.If 
you care to wait, he said, you’re very welcome.I declined with 
thanks.Fortunately it was not yet midday.There was nothing 
strange in not wanting to wait till night.Well, safe home, he said.We made a wide detour and turned our faces to the north again.These precautions were doubtless exaggerated.The right thing 
would have been to travel by night and hide during the day, at 
least in the early stages.But the weather was so fine I could not 
bring myself to do it.My pleasure was not my sole consideration, 
but it was a consideration!Such a thing had never happened to 
me before, in the course of my work.And our snail’s pace !I cannot 
have been in a hurry to arrive.I gave fitful thought, while basking in the balm of the warm 
summer days, to Gaber’s instructions.I could not reconstruct them 
to my entire satisfaction.In the night, under the boughs, screened 
from the charms of nature, I devoted myself to this problem.

Sometimes I went out of the shelter and walked up and down, in 
the dark.Or I sat down with my back against a trunk, drew my 
feet up under me, took my legs in my arms and rested my chin 
on my knee.Even in this posture I could throw no light on the 
matter.What was I looking for exactly?It is hard to say.I was 
looking for what was wanting to make Gaber’s statement complete.I felt he must have told me what to do with Molloy once he was 
found.My particular duties never terminated with the running to 
earth.That would have been too easy.But I had always to deal 
with the client in one way or anftther, according to instructions.Such operations took on a multitude of forms, from the most 
vigorous to the most discreet.The Yerk affair, which took me nearly 
three months to conclude successfully, was over on the day I suc- 
ceeded in possessing myself of his tiepin and destroying it.Estab- 
lishing contact was the least important part of my work.I found 
Yerk on the third day.I was never required to prove I had suc- 
ceeded, my word was enough.Youdi must have had some way of 
verifying.Sometimes I was asked for a report.On another occasion my mission consisted in bringing the per-

I had been allowed considerable licence as to the day.The hour

never saw one of them again, subsequently, not a single one.No con- 
clusions need be drawn from this.Oh the stories I could tell you if 
I were easy.What a rabble in my head, what a gallery of mori- 
bunds.Murphy, Watt, Yerk, Mercier and all the others.I would 
never have believed that — yes, I believe it willingly.Stories, stories.I have not been able to tell them.I shall not be able to tell this one.I could not determine therefore how I was to deal with Molloy, 
once I had found him.

The directions which Gabcr must certainly 
have given me with reference to this had gone clean out of my head.That Is what came of wasting the whole of that Sunday on stupid- 
ities.There was no good my saying, Let me see now, what is the 
usual thing?There were no usual things, in my instructions.Ad- 
mittedly there was one particular operation that recurred from time 
to time, but not often enough to be, with any degree of probability, 
the one I was looking for.But even if it had always figured in my in- 
structions, except on one single occasion, then that single occasion 
would have been enough to tie my hands, I was so scrupulous.I told myself I had better give it no more thought, that the first 
thing to do was to find Molloy, that then I would devise something, 
that there was no hurry, that the thing would come back to me when 
I least expected it and that if, having found Molloy, I still did not 
know what to do with him, I could always manage to get in touch 
with Gaber without Youdi’s knowing.I had his address just as he 
had mine.I would send him a telegram.How deal with M?To give 
me an explicit reply, though in terms if necessary veiled, was not 
beyond his powers.But was there a telegraph in Ballyba?But I 
also told myself, being only human, that the longer I took to find 
Molloy the greater my chances of remembering what I was to do 
with him.And we would have peaceably pursued our way on foot, 
but for the following incident.Summarization models summary:

One night, having finally succeeded in falling asleep beside 
my son as usual, I woke with a start, feeling as if I had just been 
dealt a violent blow.It’s all right, I am not going to tell you a 
dream properly so called.It was pitch dark in the shelter.I listened 
attentively without moving.I heard nothing save the snoring and 
gasping of my son.I was about to conclude as usual that it was 
just another bad dream when a fulgurating pain went through myMOLLOY
139
knee.This then was the explanation of my sudden awakening.The sensation could indeed well be compared to that of a blow, 
such as I fancy a horse’s hoof might give.I waited anxiously for 
it to recur, motionless and hardly breathing, and, of course, sweat- 
ing.I acted in a word precisely as one does, if my information 
was correct, at such a juncture.And sure enough the pain did 
recur a few minutes later, but not so bad as the first time, as the 
second rather.Or did it only seem less bad to me because I was 
expecting it?Or because I was getting used to it already?I think 
not.For it recurred again, several*times, and each time less bad 
than the time before, and finally subsided altogether so that I was 
able to get to sleep again more or less reassured.But before getting 
to sleep again I had time to remember that the pain in question 
was not altogether new to me.For I had felt it before, in my bath- 
room, when giving my son his enema.But then it had only attacked 
me once and never recurred, till now.

And I went to sleep again 
wondering, by way of lullaby, whether it had been the same knee 
then as the one which had just excruciated me, or the other.And 
that is a thing I have never been able to determine.And my son 
too, when asked, was incapable of telling me which of my two 
knees I had rubbed in front of him, with iodex, the night we left.And I went to sleep again a little reassured, saying.It’s a touch 
of neuralgia brought on by all the tramping and trudging and the 
chill damp nights, and promising myself to procure a packet of 
thermogene wool, with the pretty demon on the outside, at the first 
opportunity.Such is the rapidity of thought.But there was more 
to come.For waking again towards dawn, this time in consequence 
of a natural need, and with a mild erection, to make things more 
lifelike, I was unable to get up.That is to say I did get up finally 
to be sure, I simply had to, but by dint of what exertions !Unable, 
unable, it’s easy to talk about being unable, whereas in reality 
nothing is more difficult.Because of the will I suppose, which the 
least opposition seems to lash into a fury.And this explains no 
doubt how it was I despaired at first ever bending my leg again 
and then, a little later, through sheer determination, did succeed 
in bending it, slightly.The anchylosis was not total!I am still 
talking about my knee.But was it the same one that had waked140

It was not 
painful.It simply refused to bend.The pain, having warned me 
several times in vain, had no more to say.That is how I saw it.It would have been impossible for me to kneel, for example, for 
no matter how you kneel you must always bend both knees, unless 
you adopt an attitude frankly grotesque and impossible to main- 
tain for more than a few seconds, I mean with the bad leg stretched 
out before you, like a Caucasian dancer.I examined the bad knee 
in the light of my torch.It was neither red nor swollen.I fiddled 
with the knee-cap.It felt like a' clitoris.All this time my son was 
puffing like a grampus.He had no suspicion of what life could do 
to you.I too was innocent.But I knew it.The sky was that horrible colour which heralds dawn.Things 
steal back into position for the day, take their stand, sham dead.I sat down cautiously, and I must say with a certain curiosity, on 
the ground.Anyone else would have tried to sit down as usual, 
off-handedly.Not I.New as this new cross was I at once found the 
most comfortable way of being crushed.But when you sit down 
on the ground you must sit down tailor-wise, or like a foetus, 
these are so to speak the only possible positions, for a beginner.So that I was not long in letting myself fall back flat on my back.And I was not long either in making the following addition to the 
sum of my knowledge, that when the innumerable attitudes adopted 
unthinkingly by the normal man all are precluded but two or three, 
then these are enhanced.I would have sworn just the opposite, but 
for this experience.

Yes, when you can neither stand nor sit with 
comfort, you take refuge in the horizontal, like a child in its 
mother’s lap.You explore it as never before and find it possessed 
of unsuspected delights.In short it becomes infinite.And if in spite 
of all you come to tire of it in the end, you have only to stand up, 
or indeed sit up, for a few seconds.Such are the advantages of a 
local and painless paralysis.And it would not surprise me if the 
great classical paralysis were to offer analogous and perhaps even 
still more unspeakable satisfactions.To be literally incapable of 
motion at last, that must be something!My mind swoons when I 
think of it.And mute into the bargain !And perhaps as deaf as a 
post!And who knows as blind as a bat!And as likely as not yourMOLLOY
141
memoiy a blank!And just enough brain intact to allow you to 
exult !And to dread death like a regeneration.I considered the problem of what I should do if my leg didnot get better or got worse.I watched, through the branches, thesky sinking.The sky sinks in the morning, this fact has been in- 
sufficiently observed.It stoops, as if to get a better look.Unlessit is the earth that lifts itself up, to be approved, before it sets out.I shall, not expound my reasoning.I could do so easily, so 
easily.Its conclusion made possible the composition of the follow- 
ing passage.Did you have a good night?I said, as soon as my son opened 
his eyes.I could have waked him, but no, I let him wake naturally.Finally he told me he did not feel well.Summarization models summary:

I have been to Condom and knew it was a small village and had some acquaintances among its inhabitants.
My son suggested that he should go to Hole, a fifteen-mile-long distance away, to buy a bicycle for his father.
He gave his father five pounds in ten-shilling notes and instructed him to buy it second-hand for preference.
The father was surprised by the amount of money he gave him and asked him if he was pleased with the purchase.
Despite the money, the father did not seem pleased with his decision.
When the father asked for the notes, he counted them and gave four pounds ten.

Do you imagine a

perhaps inside it.You see no difference between second-hand and

to say, because I shall not say it twice.He came over to me and 
knelt down.You would have thought I was about to breathe my 
last.Do you know what a new bicycle is?I said.Yes papa, he said.Very well, I said, if you can’t find a second-hand bicycle buy a new

give his name and say it was I, Jacques Moran, ostensibly at home

he was pleased.But I regretted my phrase, it could only add to his 
confusion.But perhaps this family chat has lasted long enough.He left the shelter and when I judged he was at a safe distance I 
left it too, painfully.He had gone about twenty paces.Leaning 
nonchalantly against a tree-trunk, my good leg boldly folded across 
the other, I tried to look light-hearted.I hailed him.He turned.I waved my hand.He stared at me an instant, then turned away

understand my son.He must have known he was out of range, 
even of a good stone, and yet he took to his heels.Perhaps he was 
afraid I would run after him.And indeed, I think there is something 
terrifying about the way I run, with my head flung back, my teeth 
clenched, my elbows bent to the full and my knees nearly hitting 
me in the face.And I have often caught faster runners than myself 
thanks to this way of running.They stop and wait for me, rather 
than prolong such a horrible outburst at their heels.As for the 
lamp, we did not need a lamp.Later, when the bicycle had taken 
its place in my son’s life, in the refund of his duties and his inno- 
cent games, then a lamp would be indispensable, to light his way 
in the night.And no doubt it was in anticipation of those happy 
days that I had thought of the lamp and cried out to my son to buy 
a good one, that later on his comings and goings should not be 
hemmed about with darkness and with dangers.

And similarly I 
might have told him to be careful about the bell, to unscrew the 
little cap and examine it well inside, so as to make sure it was a 
good bell and in good working order, before concluding the trans- 
action, and to ring it to hear the ring it made.But we would have 
time enough, later on, to see to all these things.And it would be 
my joy to help my son, when the time came, to fit his bicycle 
with the best lamps, both front and rear, and the best bell and the 
best brakes that money could buy.The day seemed very long.I missed my son!I busied myself 
as best I could.I ate several times.I took advantage of being alone 
at last, with no other witness than God, to masturbate.My son must 
have had the same idea, he must have stopped on the way to 
masturbate.I hope he enjoyed it more than I did.I circled the 
shelter several times, thinking the exercise would benefit my knee.I moved at quite a good speed and without much pain, but I soon 
tired.After ten or eleven steps a great weariness seized hold of my 
leg, a heaviness rather, and I had to stop.It went away at once and 
I was able to go on.I took a little morphine.I asked myself certain 
questions.Why had I not told my son to bring me back something 
for my leg?Why had I hidden my condition from him?Was I 
secretly glad that this had happened to me, perhaps even to the 
point of not wanting to get well?I surrendered myself to the146

looked at my reflection, then I washed my face and hands.I waited 
for my image to come back, I watched it as it trembled towards 
an ever increasing likeness.Now and then a drop, falling from my 
face, shattered it again.I did not sec a soul all day.But towards 
evening I heard a prowling about the shelter.I did not move, and 
the footsteps died away.But a little later, having left the shelter 
for some reason or other, I saw a man a few paces off, standing 
motionless.He had his back to me.He wore a coat much too 
heavy for the time of the year and was leaning on a stick so 
massive, and so much thicker at the bottom than at the top, that 
it seemed more like a club.He turned and we looked at each other 
for some time in silence.That is to say I looked him full in the 
face, as I always do, to make people think I am not afraid, whereas 
he merely threw me a rapid glance from time to time, then lowered 
his eyes, less from timidity apparently than in order quietly to 
think over what he had just seen, before adding to it.

There was a 
coldness in his stare, and a thrust, the like of which I never saw.His face was pale and noble, I could have done with it.I was think- 
ing he could not be much over fifty-five when he took off his hat, 
held it for a moment in his hand, then put it back on his head.No 
resemblance to what is called raising one’s hat.But I thought it 
advisable to nod.The hat was quite extraordinary, in shape and 
colour.I shall not attempt to describe it, it was like none I had ever 
seen.He had a huge shock of dirty snow-white hair.I had time, 
before he squeezed it in back under his hat, to see the way it 
swelled up on his skull.His face was dirty and hairy, yes, pale, 
noble, dirty and hairy.He made a curious movement, like a hen that 
puffs up its feathers and slowly dwindles till it is smaller than 
before.I thought he was going to depart without a word to me.But suddenly he asked me to give him a piece of bread.He ac-MOLLOY

companied this humiliating request with a fiery look.His accent 
was that of a foreigner or of one who had lost the habit of speech.But had I not said already with relief, at the mere sight of his back.He’s a foreigner.Would you like a tin of sardines?I said.He asked 
for bread and I offered him fish.That is me all over.Bread, he said.I went into the shelter and took the piece of bread I was keeping 
for my son, who would probably be hungry when he came back.I gave it to him.I expected him to devour it there and then.Summarization models summary:

thus equipped I no longer confined myself to circling about the

a better view of the expanse where my son might suddenly rise into

what I was to do with Molloy, once I found him.And on myself 
too I pored, on me so changed from what I was.And I seemed to 
see myself ageing as swiftly as a day-fly.But the idea of ageing was 
not exactly the one which offered itself to me.And What I saw was 
more like a crumbling, a frenzied collapsing of all that had always 
protected me from all I was condemned to be.Or it was like a 
kind of clawing towards a light and countenance I could not name, 
that I had once known and loflg denied.But what words can 
describe this sensation at first all darkness and bulk, with a noise 
like the grinding of stones, then suddenly as soft as water flowing.And then I saw a little globe swaying up slowly from the depths, 
through the quiet water, smooth at first, and scarcely paler than 
its escorting ripples, then little by little a face, with holes for the 
eyes and mouth and other wounds, and nothing to show if it was 
a man’s face or a woman’s face, a young face or an old face, or 
if its calm too was not an effect of the water trembling between it 
and the light.But I confess I attended but absently to these poor 
figures, in which I suppose my sense of disaster sought to contain 
itself.And that I did not labour at them more diligently was a 
further index of the great changes I had suffered and of my grow-

feebly that I should soon be dead of inanition, if I did not succeed 
in renewing my provisions.So much for the second day.But one 
incident remains to be noted, before I go on to the third.It was evening.I had lit my tire and was watching it take when 
I heard myself hailed.The voice, already so near that I started 
violently, was that of a man.

But after this one violent start I 
collected myself and continued to busy myself with my fire as if 
nothing had happened, poking it with a branch I had torn from 
its tree.for the purpose a little earlier and stripped of its twigs and 
leaves and even part of its bark, with my bare nails.I have always 
loved skinning branches and laying bare the pretty white glossy 
shaft of sapwood.But obscure feelings of love and pity for the 
tree held me back most of the time.And I numbered among my 
familiars the dragon-tree of Teneriffe that perished at the age of 
five thousand years, struck by lightning.It was an example of 
longevity.The branch was thick and full of sap and did not burn 
when I stuck it in the fire.I held it by the thin end.The crackling 
of the fire, of the writhing brands rather, for fire triumphant does 
not crackle, but makes an altogether different noise, had permitted 
the man to come right up to me, without my knowledge.If there 
is one thing infuriates me it is being taken myself by surprise.I 
continued then, in spite of my spasm of fright, hoping it had passed 
unnoticed, to poke the fire as if I were alone.But at the thump 
of his hand on my shoulder I had no choice but to do what anyone 
else would have done in my place, and this I achieved by suddenly 
spinning round in what I trust was a good imitation of fear and 
anger.There I was face to face with a dim man, dim of face 
and dim of body, because of the dark.Put it there, he said.But 
little by little I formed an idea of the type of individual it was.Summarization models summary:

was precisely the kind of pest I had thought he was, without being 
sure, because of the dark.Can you tell me, he said.I shall have 
to describe him briefly, though such a thing is contrary to my prin- 
ciples.He was on the small side, but thick-set.He wore a thick 
navy-blue suit (double-breasted) of hideous cut and a pair of out- 
rageously wide black shoes, with the toe-caps higher than the 
uppers.This dreadful shape seems only to occur in black shoes.Do 
you happen to know, he said.The fringed extremities of a dark 
muffler, seven feet long at least, wound several times round his 
neck, hung down his back.He ha*d a narrow-brimmed dark blue 
felt hat on his head, with a fish-hook and an artificial fly stuck 
in the band, which produced a highly sporting effect.Do you hear 
me?he said.

But all this was nothing compared to the face which 
I regret to say vaguely resembled my own, less the refinement of 
course, same little abortive moustache, same little ferrety eyes, 
same paraphimosis of the nose, and a thin red mouth that looked 
as if it was raw from trying to shit its tongue.Hey you!he said.I turned back to my fire.It was doing nicely.I threw more wood 
on it.Do you hear me talking to you?he said.I went towards the 
shelter, he barred my way, emboldened by my limp.Have you a 
tongue in your head?he said.I don’t know you, I said.I laughed.I had not intended to be witty.Would you care to see my card?he said.It would mean nothing to me, I said.He came closer to 
me.Get out of my way, I said.It was his turn to laugh.You refuse 
to answer?he said.I made a great effort.What do you want to 
know?I said He must have thought I was weakening.That’s more 
like it, he said.I called to my aid the image of my son who might 
arrive at any moment.I’ve already told you, he said.I was trembl- 
ing all over.Have the goodness to tell me again, I said.To cut a 
long story short he wanted to know if I had seen an old man with 
a stick pass by.He described him.Badly.The voice seemed to 
come to ’"it from afar.No, I said.What do you mean no?he said.I have seen no one, I said.And yet he passed this way, he said.I said nothing.Summarization models summary:

SAMUEL BECKETT
I can still see the hand coming towards me, pallid, opening and 
closing.As if self-propelled.I do not know what happened then.But a little later, perhaps a long time later, I found him stretched 
on the ground, his head in a pulp.I am sorry I cannot indicate 
more clearly^ how this result was obtained, it would have been 
something worth reading.But it is not at this late stage of my 
relation that I intend to give way to literature.I myself was un- 
scathed, except for a few scratches I did not discover till the 
following day.I bent over him.As I did so I realised my leg was 
bending- normally.He no longer resembled me.I took him by the 
ankles and dragged him backwards into the shelter.His shoes 
shone with highly polished blacking.He wore fancy socks.The 
trousers slid back, disclosing the white hairless legs.His ankles 
were bony, like my own.My fingers encircled them nearly.He was 
wearing suspenders, one of which had come undone and was hang- 
ing loose.This detail went to my heart.Already my knee was 
stiffening again.It no longer required to be supple.I went back 
to the shelter and took my son’s raincoat.I went back to the fire 
and lay down, with the coat over me.

I did not get much sleep, 
but I got some.I listened to the owls.They were not eagle-owls, it 
was a cry like the whistle of a locomotive.I listened to a nightin- 
gale.And to distant corncrakes.If I had heard of other birds that 
cry and sing at night, I should have listened to them too.I 
watched the fire dying, my cheek pillowed on my hands.I watched 
out for the dawn.It was hardly breaking when I got up and went 
to the shelter.His legs too were on the stiff side, but there was 
still some play in the hip joints, fortunately.I dragged him into 
the copse, with frequent rests on the way, but without letting go 
his legs, so as not to have to stoop again to pick them up.Then I 
dismantled the shelter and threw the branches over the body.I 
packed and shouldered the two bags, took the raincoat and the 
umbrella.In a word I struck camp.But before leaving I consulted 
with myself to make sure I was forgetting nothing, and without 
relying on my intelligence alone, for I felt my pockets and looked 
around me.And it was while feeling my pockets that I discovered 
something of which my mind had been powerless to inform me, 
namely that my keys were no longer there.I was not long in findingMOLLO Y

the truth first I found the chain, then the keys and last the ring,

And since it was out of the question, even with the 
help of my umbrella, to stoop each time to pick up a key, I put 
down my bags, my umbrella and the coat and lay down flat on my 
stomach among the keys which in this way I was afte to recover 
without much difficulty.And when a key was beyond my reach 
I took hold of the grass and dragged myself over to it.And I 
wiped each key on the grass, before putting it in my pocket, whether 
it needed wiping or not.And front time to time I raised myself on 
my hands, to get a better view.And in this way I located a number 
of keys at some distance from me, and these I reached by rolling 
over and over, like a great cylinder.And finding no more keys, I 
said.There is no use my counting them, for I do not know how 
many there were.And my eyes resumed their search.But finally 
I said.Hell to it.I’ll do with those I have.And while looking in 
this way for my keys I found an ear which I threw into the copse.And, to my even greater surprise, I found my straw hat which I 
thought was on my head!One of the holes for the elastic had 
expanded to the edge of the rim and consequently was no longer 
a hole, but a slit.But the other had been spared and the elastic 
was still in it.And finally I said, I shall rise now and, from my 
full height, run my eyes over this area for the last time.Which I 
did.It was then I found the ring, first one piece, then the other.

Then, finding nothing more belonging cither to me or to my son, I 
shouldered my bags again, jammed the straw-hat hard down on 
my skull, folded my son’s raincoat over my arm, caught up the 
umbrella and went.But I did not go far.For I soon stopped on the crest of a rise 
from where I could survey, without fatigue, the camp-site and the 
surrounding country.And I made this curious observation, that 
the land from where I was, and even the clouds in the sky, were 
so disposed as to lead the eyes gently to the camp, as in a painting 
by an old master.I made myself as comfortable as possible.I got rid of my various burdens and I ate a whole tin of 
sardines and one apple.I lay down flat on my stomach on my 
son’s coat.And now I propped my elbows on the ground and my154

jaws between my hands, which carried my eyes towards the horizon, 
and now I made a little cushion of my two hands on the ground and 
laid my cheek upon it, five minutes one, five minutes the other, 
all the while flat on my stomach.I could have made myself a 
pillow of thojiags, but I did not, it did not occur to me.The day 
passed tranquilly, without incident.And the only thing that re- 
lieved the monotony of this third day was a dog.When I first 
saw him he was sniffing about the remains of my fire, then he 
went into the copse.Summarization models summary:

found another question, or other questions, demanding in their

Translating myself now in imagination to the present moment, 
I declare the foregoing to have been written with a firm and even

fault committed in the execution of my duty.And they can do 
nothing to my son, rather they will commiserate with him on hav-

will pour in upon him from every side.So this third day wore away.And about five o’clock I ate 
my last tin of sardines and a few biscuits, with a good appetite.This left me with only a few apples and a few biscuits.But about 
seven o’clock my son arrived.The sun was low in the west.I must 
have dozed a moment, for I did not see him coming, a speck on 
the horizon, then rapidly bigger and bigger, as I had foreseen.But he was already between me and the camp, making for the 
latter, when I saw him.A wave of irritation broke over me, I 
jumped to my feet and began to vociferate, brandishing the um- 
brella.He turned and I beckoned him to join me, waving the um- 
brella as if I wanted to hook something with the handle.I thought 
for a moment he was going to defy me and continue on his way

no more.But finally he came towards me.Summarization models summary:

picked it up.What happened to you?he said.I had a fall, I said.A fall?he said.Yes, a fall, I cried, did you never have a fall?I 
tried to remember the name of the plant that springs from the 
ejaculations of the hanged and shrieks when plucked.How much 
did you give for it?I said.Four pounds, he said.Four pounds!I cried.If he had said two pounds or even thirty shillings I should 
have cried.Two pounds !or Thirty shillings !the same.They asked 
four pounds five, he said.Have you the receipt?I said.He did not 
know what a receipt was.I described one.The money I spent on 
my son’s education and he did not know what a simple receipt 
was.But I think he knew as well as I.For when I said to him.Now tell me what a receipt is, he told me very prettily.

I really 
did not care in the least whether he had been fooled into paying 
for the bicycle three or four times what it was worth or whether 
on the other hand he had appropriated the best part of the pur- 
chase money for his own use.The loss would not be mine.Give 
me the ten shillings, I said.I spent them, he said.Enough, enough.He began explaining that the first day the shops had been closed, 
that the second — .I said.Enough, enough.I looked at the carrier.It was the best thing about that bicycle.It and the pump.Does 
it go by any chance?I said.I had a puncture two miles from Hole,

it up, I said.I held the bicycle.I forget which wheel it was.As 
soon as two things are nearly identical I am lost.The dirty little 
twister was letting the air escape between the valve and the con- 
nection which he had purposely not screwed tight.Hold the bicycle, 
I said, and give me the pump.The tyre was soon hard.I looked 
at my son.He began to protest.I soon put a stop to that.Five 
minutes later I felt the tyre.It was as hard as ever.I cursed him.He took a bar of chocolate from his pocket and offered it to me.I took it.But instead of eating it, as I longed to, and although I

dug into my buttocks.The more things resist me the more rabid 
I get.With time, and nothing but my teeth and na^jls, I would 
rage up from the bowels of the earth to its crust, knowing full 
well I had nothing to gain.And when I had no more teeth, no 
more nails, I would dig through the rock with my bones.Here 
then in a few words is the solution I arrived at.First the bags, 
then my son’s raincoat folded in f&ur, all lashed to the carrier and 
the saddle with my son’s bits of string.As for the umbrella, I 
hooked it round my neck, so as to have both hands free to hold 
on to my son by the waist, under the aimpits rather, for by this 
time my seat was higher than his.Pedal, I said.He made a des-

my shin.I was all tangled up in the back wheel.Help!I cried.My son helped me up.My stocking was torn and my leg bleeding.Happily it was the sick leg.What would I have done, with both 
legs out of action?I would have found a way.It was even per- 
haps a blessing in disguise.I was thinking of phlebotomy of course.Are you all right?I said.Yes, he said.He would be.

With my 
umbrella I caught him a smart blow on the hamstrings, gleaming 
between the leg of his shorts and his stocking.He cried out.Do 
you want to kill us?I said.I’m not strong enough, he said, I’m 
not strong enough.The bicycle was all right apparently, the back 
wheel slightly buckled perhaps.I at once saw the error I had 
made.It was to have settled down in my seat, with my feet 
clear of the ground, before we moved off.I reflected.We’ll 
try again, I said.I can’t, he said.Don’t try me too far, 
I said.He straddled the frame.Start off gently when I tell you, I 
said.I got up again behind and settled down in my seat, with my 
feet clear of the ground.Good.Wait till I tell you, I said.I let 
myself slide to one side till the foot of my good leg touched the 
ground.The only weight now on the back wheel was that of my 
sick leg, cocked up rigid at an excruciating angle.I dug my Angers

I thought about 
myself, much, as we went along, sitting behind my son, looking 
over his head, and in the evening, when we camped, while he 
made himself useful, and when he went away, leaving me alone.For he often went away, to spy out the lie of the land and to buy 
provisions.I did practically nothing any more.He took good care 
of me, I must say.He was clumsy, stupid, slow, dirty, untruthful, 
deceitful, prodigal, unfilial, but he did not abandon me.I thought 
much about myself.That is to say I often took a quick look at 
myself, closed my eyes, forgot, began again.We took a long time

stopped I looked about me.I looked at the shepherd, the sheep, 
the dog and even at the sky.But when I moved I saw nothing 
but the ground and the play of my feet, the good one springing 
forward, holding back, setting itself down, waiting for the other 
to come up.I came finally to a halt about ten paces from the 
shepherd.There was no use going any further.How I would love 
to dwell upon him.His dog loved him, his sheep did not fear him.Soon he would rise, feeling the falling dew.The fold was far, far, 
he would see from afar the light in his cot.Now I was in the midst 
of the sheep, they made a circle round me.their eyes converged on 
me.Perhaps I was the butcher come to make his choice.I took 
off my hat.I saw the dog's eyes following the movement of my 
hand.I looked about me again incapable of speech.I did not know 
how I would ever be able to break this silence.I was on the point 
of turning away without having spoken.Finally I said, Ballyba, 
hoping it sounded like a question.The shepherd drew the pipe from 
his mouth and pointed the stem at the ground.I longed to say.Take me with you, I will serve you faithfully, just for a place to 
lie and a little food.I had understood, but without seeming to I

brings out trie lights, the stars in the sky and on earth the brave 
little lights of men.By day the shepherd would have raised his

sky.But now I felt the man turning towards me again, and the 
dog, and the man drawing on nis pipe again, in the hope it had 
not gone out.And I knew I was all alone gazing at that distant 
glow that would get brighter and brighter, I knew that too, then 
suddenly go out.And I did not like the feeling of being alone, with 
my son perhaps, no, alone, spellbound.And I was wondering 
how to depart without self-loathing or sadness, or with as little as 
possible, when a kind of immense sigh all round me announced 
it was not I who was departing, but the flock.Summarization models summary:

I watched them 
move away, the man in front, then the sheep, huddled together, 
their heads sunk, jostling one another, breaking now and then into 
a little trot, snatching blindly without stopping a last mouthful 
from the earth, and last of all the dog, jauntily, waving his long 
black plumy tail, though there was no one to witness his content- 
ment, if that is what it was.And so in perfect order, the shepherd 
silent and the dog unheeded, the little flock departed.And so no 
doubt they would plod on, until they came to the stable or the 
fold.And there the shepherd stands aside to let them pass and 
he counts them as they go by, though he knows not one is missing.Then he turns towards his cottage, the kitchen door is open, the 
lamp is burning, he goes in and sits down at the table, without 
taking off his hat.But the dog stops at the threshold, not knowing 
whether he may go in or whether he must stay out, all night.That night I had a violent scene with my son.I do not remem- 
ber about what.Wait, it may be important.No, I don’t know.I must have had so many scenes with my 
son.At the time it must have seemed a scene like any other, 
that’s all I know.I must have got the better of it as I always did, thanks to myMOLLOY

infallible technique, and brought him unerringly to a proper sense 
of his iniquities.But the next day I realised my mistake.For 
waking early I found myself alone, in the shelter, I who was 
always the first to wake.

And what is more my instinct told me 
I had been alone for some considerable time, my breatj^no longer 
mingling with the breath of my son, in the narrow shelter he had 
erected, under my supervision.Not that the fact of his having 
disappeared with the bicycle, during the night or with the first 
guilty flush of dawn, was in itself a matter for grave anxiety.And 
I would have found excellent and ’honourable reasons for this, if 
this had been all.Unfortunately he had taken his knapsack and 
his raincoat.And there remained nothing in the shelter, nor outside 
the shelter, belonging to him, absolutely nothing.And this was 
not yet all, for he had left with a considerable sum of money, he 
who was only entitled to a few pence from time to time, for his 
savings-box.For since he had been in charge of everything, under 
my supervision of course, and notably of the shopping, I was 
obliged to place a certain reliance on him in the matter of money.And he always had a far greater sum in his pocket than was 
strictly necessary.And in order to make all this sound more likely 
I shall add what follows.1.I desired him to learn double-entry book-keeping and had 
instructed him in its rudiments.2.I could no longer be bothered with these wretched trifles 
which had once been my delight.3.I had told him to keep an eye out, on his expeditions, for 
a second bicycle, light and inexpensive.For I was weary of the 
carrier and I also saw the day approaching when my son would 
no longer have the strength to pedal for the two of us.Summarization models summary:

But on examining my pocket-book I found it contained no 
more than fifteen shillings, which led me to the conclusion that 
my son had not been content with the sum already in his possession, 
but had gone through my pockets, before he left, while I slept.And the ^yjuman breast is so bizarre that my first feeling was of 
gratitude for his leaving me this little sum, enough to keep me 
going until help arrived, and I saw in this a kind of delicacy !I was therefore alone, with my bag, my umbrella (which he 
might easily have taken too) and fifteen shillings, knowing myself 
coldly abandoned, with deliberation and no doubt premeditation, in 
Ballyba it is true, if indeed I was in Ballyba, but still far from 
Bally.And I remained for several days, I do not know how many, in 
the place where my son had abandoned me, eating my last pro- 
visions (which he might easily have taken too), seeing no living 
soul, powerless to act, or perhaps strong enough at last to act no 
more.

For I had no illusions, I knew that all was about to end, 
or to begin again, it little mattered which, and it little mattered 
how, I had only to wait.And on and off, for fun, and the better 
to scatter them to the winds, I dallied with the hopes that spring 
eternal, childish hopes, as for example that my son, his anger 
spent, would have pity on me and come back to me!Or that 
Molloy, whose country this was, would come to me, who had not 
been able to go to him, and grow to be a friend, and like a father 
to me, and help me do what I had to do, so that Youdi would not 
be angry with me and would not punish me!Yes, I let them spring 
within me and grow in strength, brighten and charm me with a 
thousand fancies, and then I swept them away, with a great dis- 
gusted sweep of all my being, I swept myself clean of them and 
surveyed with satisfaction the void they had polluted.And in the 
evening I turned to the lights of Bally, I watched them shine 
brighter and brighter, then all go out together, or nearly all, foul 
little flickering lights of terrified men.And I said.To think I might 
be there now, but for my misfortune!And with regard to the 
Obidil, of whom I have refrained from speaking, until now, and 
whom I so longed to see face to face, all I can say with regard to 
him is this, that I never saw him, either face to face or darkly, 
perhaps there is no such person, that would not greatly surprise me.MOLLO Y

And at the thought of the punishments Youdi might inflict upon 
me I was seized by such a mighty fit of laughter that I shook, with 
mighty silent laughter and my features composed in their wonted 
sadness and calm.But my whole body shook, and even my legs, 
so that I had to lean against a tree, or against a bujW when the 
fit came on me standing, my umbrella being no longer sufficient 
to keep me from falling.Strange laughter truly, and no doubt 
misnamed, through indolence perhaps, or ignorance.And as for 
myself, that unfailing pastime, I must say it was far now from my 
thoughts.But there were moments when it did not seem so far 
from me, when I seemed to be drawing towards it as the sands 
towards the wave, when it crests and whitens, though I must say 
this image hardly fitted my situation, which was rather that of 
the turd waiting for the flush.And I note here the little beat my 
heart once missed, in my home, when a fly, flying low above my 
ash-tray, raised a little ash, with the breath of its wings.And I 
grew gradually weaker and weaker and more and more content.For several days I had eaten nothing.I could probably have found 
blackberries and mushrooms, but I had no wish for them.I re- 
mained all day stretched out in the shelter, vaguely regretting my 
son’s raincoat, and I crawled out in the evening to have a good 
laugh at the lights of Bally.And though suffering a little from wind 
and cramps in the stomach I felt extraordinarily content, content 
with myself, almost elated, enchanted with my performance.

And 
I said, I shall soon lose consciousness altogether, it is merely a 
question of time.But Gaber’s arrival put a stop to these frolics.It was evening.I had just crawled out of the shelter for my 
evening guffaw and the better to savour my exhaustion.He had 
already been there for some time.He was sitting on a tree-stump, 
half asleep.Well Moran, he said.You recognise me?I said.He 
took out and opened his notebook, licked his finger, turned over 
the pagwS till he came to the right page, raised it towards his eyes 
which at the same time he lowered towards it.I can see nothing,

I was.What did he tell you?I said.I don’t understand, said Gaber.You were saying a minute ago that he had told you something, 
I said, then I cut you short.Short?said Gaber.Do you know what 
he told me the other day, I said, those were your very words.His 
face lit up.The clod was just about as quick as my son.He said to 
me, said Gaber, Gaber, he said — .Louder!I cried.He said to me, 
said Gaber, Gaber, he said, life is a thing of beauty, Gaber, and a 
joy for ever.He brought his face nearer mine.A joy for ever, he 
said, a thing of beauty, Moran, and a joy for ever.He smiled.I 
closed my eyes.Smiles arc all very nice in their own way, very 
heartening, but at a reasonable distance.I said.Do you think he 
meant human life?I listened.Perhaps he didn’t mean human 
life, I said.I opened my eyes.I was alone.My hands were full 
of grass and earth I had torn up unwittingly, was still tearing up.I was literally uprooting.I desisted, yes, the second I realised what 
I had done, what I was doing, such a nasty thing, I desisted from 
it, I opened my hands, they were soon empty.That night I set out for home.I did not get far.But it was a 
start.It is the first step that counts.The second counts less.Each 
day saw me advance a little further.

That last sentence is not 
clear, it docs not say what I hoped it would.I counted at first 
by tens of steps.I stopped when I could go no further and I said, 
Bravo, that makes so many tens, so many more than yesterday.Then I counted by fifteens, by twenties and finally by fifties.Yes, 
in the end I could go fifty steps before having to stop, for rest.166

fields, the waters had to offer me in the way of edibles.I finished 
the morphine.It was in August, in September at the latest, that I was ordered 
home.It was spring when I got there, I will not be more precise.I had therefore been all winter on the way.Anyone else would have lain down in the snow, firmly re- 
solved never to rise again.Not I. I used to think that men would 
never get the better of me.I still think I am cleverer than things.There are men and there are things, to hell with animals.And with 
God.When a thing resists me, even if it is for my own good, it 
does not resist me long.This snow, for example.Though to tell the

resisted me.That was enough.Summarization models summary:

I vanquished it, grinding my teeth 
with joy, it is quite possible to grind one’s incisors.I forged my 
way through it, towards what I would have called my ruin if I 
could have conceived what I had left to be ruined.Perhaps I have 
conceived it since, perhaps I have not done conceiving it, it takes 
time, one is bound to in time, I am bound to.But on the way 
home, a prey to the malignancy of man and nature and my own 
failing flesh, I could not conceive it.My knee, allowance made for 
the dulling effects of habit, was neither more nor less painful than 
the first day.The disease, whatever it was, was dormant!How can 
such things be?But to return to the flies, I like to think of those 
that hatch out at the beginning of winter, within doors, and die 
shortly after.You see them crawling and fluttering in the warm 
corners, puny, sluggish, torpid, mute.That is you see an odd one 
now and then.They must die very young, without having been 
able to lay.You sweep them away, you push them into the dust-pan 
with the brush, without knowing.That is a strange race of flies.But 
I was succumbing to other affections, that is not the word, intestinal 
for the most part, I would have described them once, not now, 
I am sorry, it would have been worth reading.I shall merely sayMOL LO Y

that no one else would have surmounted them, without help.But 
I !Bent double, my free hand pressed to my belly, I advanced, and 
every now and then I let out a roar, of triumph and distress.

Certain 
mosses I consumed must have disagreed with me.I if I once 
made up my mind not to keep the hangman waiting, dlfe bloody 
flux itself would not stop me, I would get there on all fours shit- 
ting out my entrails and chanting maledictions.Didn’t I tell you 
it’s my brethren that have done for me.But I shall not dwell upon thip journey home, its furies and 
treacheries.And I shall pass over in silence the fiends in human 
shape and the phantoms of the dead that tried to prevent me from 
getting home, in obedience to Youdi’s command.But one or two 
words nevertheless, for my own edification and to prepare my soul 
to make an end.To begin with my rare thoughts.Certain questions of a theological nature preoccupied me 
strangely.As for example.1.What value is to be attached to the theory that Eve sprang, 
not from Adam’s rib, but from a tumour in the fat of his leg (arse?).2.Did the serpent crawl or, as Comestor affirms, walk upright?3.Did Mary conceive through the ear, as Augustine and 
Adobard assert?4.How much longer are we to hang about waiting for the 
antechrist?5.Does it really matter which hand is employed to absterge 
the podex?6.What is one to think of the Irish oath sworn by the natives 
with the right hand on the relics of the saints and the left on the 
virile member?7.Does nature observe the sabbath?8.Is it true that the devils do not feel the pains of hell?9.The algebraic theology of Craig.What is one to think ofthis?10.Summarization models summary:

Molloy is a goth chick with bad posture, a terrible voice, and a strong sense of honor. She often bullies her brother, but often ends up getting hurt herself. 
Yerk is the mascot of a local children's club, but he looks like the cartoon character Wile E. Coyote from the cartoon and dresses like the cartoon characters Rocky Horror from the movie, but that is not what he is supposed to look like. He is made of human skin like a man with a mohawk.

Merging and summarizing: 
These evolutions I finally 
interpreted as a system of signals by means of which the incoming 
bees, satisfied or dissatisfied with their plunder, informed the out- 
going bees in what direction to go, and in what not to go.But the 
outgoing bees danced too.It was no doubt their way of saying, 
I understand, or.Don’t worry about me.But away from the hive, 
and busily at work, the bees did not dance.Here their watchword 
seemed to be.Every man for himself, assuming bees to be capable 
of such notions.The most striking feature of the dance was its 
very complicated figures, traced in flight, and I had classified a 
great number of these, with their probable meanings.But there 
was also the question of the hum, so various in tone in the vicinity 
of the hive that this could hardly be an effect of chance.I first con- 
cluded that each figure was reinforced by means of a hum peculiar 
to it.But I was forced to abandon this agreeable hypothesis.For 
I saw the same figure (at least what I called the same figure) ac- 
companied by very different hums.So that I said.The purpose of 
the hum ' is not to emphasise the dance, but on the contrary to 
vary it.And the same figure exactly differs in meaning according 
to the hum that goes with it.And I had collected and classified a 
great number of observations on this subject, with gratifying results.But there was to be considered not only the figure and the hum, 
but also the height at which the figure was executed.And I acquired170
SAMUEL BECKETT


the conviction that the selfsame figure, accompanied by the self- 
same hum, did not mean at all the same thing at twelve feet from 
the ground as it did at six.For the bees did not dance at any level, 
haphazard, but there were three or four levels, always the same, 
at which tftey danced.And if I were to tell you what these levels 
were, and what the relations between them, for I had measured 
them with care, you would not believe me.And this is not the 
moment to jeopardise my credit.Sometimes you would think I was 
writing for the public.And in spite of all the pains I have lavished 
on these problems, I was more than ever stupefied by the complexity 
of this innumerable dance, involving doubtless other determinants 
of which I had not the slightest idea.And I said, with rapture.Here 
is something I can study all my life, and never understand.And all 
during this long journey home, when I racked my mind for a little 
joy in store, the thought of my bees and their dance was the nearest 
thing to comfort.For I was still eager for my little joy, from time 
to time!And I admitted with good grace the possibility that this 
dance was after all no better than the dances of the people of the 
West, frivolous and meaningless.But for me, sitting near my sun- 
drenched hives, it would always be a noble thing to contemplate, 
too noble ever to be sullied by the cogitations of a man like me, 
exiled in his manhood.And I would never do my bees the wrong 
I had done my God, to whom I had been taught to ascribe my 
angers, fears, desires, and even my body.Summarization models summary: 
The dance of the bees is described by Samuel Beckett as a system of signals by which the incoming bees communicate with the out-of-the-hive bees.
Samuel Beckett has collected and classified a great number of observations on the dance, including its complicated figures and the hum associated with them.
The bees in the hive communicate with each other by dancing, but away from the hive, where they are busy and busy at work, they do not dance.
SAMUEL BECKETT has developed a theory of the dance and has discovered that the same figure, accompanied by different hums, has different meanings depending on the level at which the figure is executed.
He has concluded that the purpose of the hum is not to enhance the dance but to alter it.

I have spoken of a voice giving me orders, or rather advice.It was on the way home I heard it for the first time.I paid no 
attention to it.Physically speaking it seemed to me I was now becoming 
rapidly unrecognisable.And when I passed my hands over my 
face, in a characteristic and now more than ever pardonable gesture, 
the face my hands felt was not my face any more, and the hands 
my face felt were my hands no longer.And yet the gist of the 
sensation was the same as in the far-off days when I was well- 
shaven and perfumed and proud of my intellectual’s soft white 
hands.And this belly I did not know remained my belly, my old 
belly, thanks to I know not what intuition.And to tell the truth 
I not only knew who I was, but I had a sharper and clearer senseMOLLO Y

of my identity than ever before, in spite of its deep lesions and the 
wounds with which it was covered.And from this point of view 
I was less fortunate than my other acquaintances.I am sorry if 
this last phrase is not so happy as it might be.It deserved, who 
knows, to be without ambiguity.Then there are the clothes that cleave so close to the body 
and are so to speak inseparable from it, in time of peace.Yes, I 
have always been very sensitive to clothing, though not in the least 
a dandy.I had not to complain of mine, tough and of good cut.I was of course inadequately covered, but whose fault was that?

And I had to part with my straw, not made to resist the rigours 
of winter, and with my stockings (two pairs) which the cold and 
damp, the trudging and the lack of laundering facilities had literally 
annihilated.But I let out my braces to their fullest extent and my 
knickerbockers, very baggy as the fashion is, came down to my 
calves.And at the sight of the blue flesh, between the knicker- 
bockers and the tops of my boots, I sometimes thought of my son 
and the blow I had fetched him, so avid is the mind of the flimsiest 
analogy.My boots became rigid, from lack of proper care.So skin 
defends itself, when dead and tanned.The air coursed through 
them freely, preserving perhaps my feet from freezing.And I had 
likewise sadly to part with my drawers (two pairs).They had 
rotted, from constant contact with my incontinences.Then the seat 
of my breeches, before it too decomposed, sawed my crack from 
Dan to Beersheba.What else did I have to discard?My shirt?Never!But I often wore it inside out and back to front.Let me 
see.I had four ways of wearing my shirt.Front to front right side 
out, front to front inside out, back to front right side out, back to 
front inside out.And the fifth day I began again.It was in the 
hope of making it last.Did this make it last?I do not know.It 
lasted.To major things the surest road is on the minor pains 
bestowed, if you don’t happen to be in a hurry.But what else did 
I have to discard?Summarization models summary:

myself faced with the following dilemma.Was I to go on leaning 
on my umbrella and get drenched or was I to stop and take shelter 
under my open umbrella?It was a false dilemma, as so many 
dilemmas are.For on the one hand all that remained of the canopy 
of my unibrella was a few flitters of silk fluttering from the stays 
and on the other I could have gone on, very slowly, using the um- 
brella no longer as a support, but as a shelter.But I was so accus- 
tomed, on the one hand to the perfect watertightness of my expen- 
sive umbrella, and on the other hand to being unable to walk 
without its support, that the dilemma remained entire, for me.I 
could of course have made myself a stick, out of a branch, and 
gone on, in spite of the rain, the snow, the hail, leaning on the 
stick and the umbrella open above me.But I did not, I do not 
know why.But when the rain descended, and the other things that 
descend upon us from above, sometimes I pushed on, leaning on 
the umbrella, getting drenched, but most often I stopped dead, 
opened the umbrella above me and waited for it to be over.Then 
I got equally drenched.But that was not the point.

And if it had 
suddenly begun to rain manna I would have waited, stock-still, 
under my umbrella, for it to be over, before taking advantage of it.And when my arm was weary of holding up the umbrella, then I 
gave it to the other hand.And with my free hand I slapped and 
rubbed every part of my body within its reach, in order to keep 
the blood trickling freely, or I drew it over my face, in a gesture 
that was characteristic, of me.And the long spike of my umbrella 
was like a finger.My best thoughts came to me during these halts.But when it was clear that the rain, etc., would not stop all day, 
or all night, then I did the sensible thing and built myself a proper 
shelter.But I did not like proper shelters, made of boughs, any 
more.For soon there were no more leaves, but only the needles 
of certain conifers.But this was not the real reason why I did not 
like proper shelters any more, no.But when I was inside them I 
could think of nothing but my son’s raincoat, I literally saw it, I 
saw nothing else, it filled all space.It was in reality what our 
English friends call a trench-coat, and I could smell the rubber, 
though trench-coats are not rubberised as a rule.So I avoided as 
far as possible having recourse to proper shelters, made of boughs.MOLLOY

But she, at least, who 
knows, in any case, yes, a pity, no matter.She is the Madonna 
of pregnant women, I said, of pregnant married women, and I have 
vowed to drag myself miserably to her niche, and thank her.This 
incident gives but a’ feeble idea of my ability, even at this late 
period.But I had gone a little too far, for the vicious look came 
back into his eye.May I ask you a favour, I said, God will reward 
you.I added, God sent you to me, this evening.Humbly to ask a 
favour of people who are on the point of knocking your brains out 
sometimes produces good results.A little hot tea,' I implored, 
without sugar or milk, to revive me.To grant such a small favour 
to a pilgrim on the rocks was frankly a temptation difficult to 
resist.Oh all right, he said, come back to the house, you can dry 
yourself, before the fire.But I cannot, I cannot, I cried, I have 
sworn to make a bee-line to her !And to efface the bad impression 
created by these words I took a florin from my pocket and gave it 
to him.For your poor-box, I said.And I added, because of the 
dark, A florin for your poor-box.It’s a long way, he said.God will 
go with you, I said.He thought it over.Well he might.Above all 
nothing to eat, I said, no really, I must not eat.Ah Moran, wily 
as a serpent, there was never the like of old Moran.Of course I 
would have preferred violence, but I dared not take the risk.

Finally he took himself off telling me to stay where I was.1 do not 
know what was in his mind.When I judged him at a safe remove 
I closed the umbrella and set off in the opposite direction, at right 
angles to the way I was going, in the driving rain.That was how 
I spent a florin.MOLLOY

Now I may make an end.I skirted the graveyard.It was night.Midnight perhaps.The 
lane is steep, I laboured.A little wind was chasing the clouds over 
the faint sky.It is a great thing to own a plot in perpetuity, a very 
great thing indeed.If only that were the only perpetuity.I came 
to the wicket.It was locked.Very properly.But I could not open it.The key went into the hole, but would not turn.Long disuse?A 
new lock?I burst it open.I drew back to the other side of the lane 
and hurled myself at it.I had come home, as Youdi had com- 
manded me.In the end I got to my feet.What smelt so sweet?The lilacs?The primroses perhaps.I went towards my hives.They 
were there, as I feared.I lifted the top off one and laid it on the 
ground.It was a little roof, with a sharp ridge, and steep over- 
hanging slopes.I put my hand in the hive, moved it among the 
empty trays, felt along the bottom.It encouiTtercd, in a corner, a 
dry light ball.It crumbled under my fingers.They had clustered 
together for a little warmth, to try and sleep.I took out a handful.It was too dark to see, I put it in my pocket.Summarization models summary:

I shall soon be quite dead at last in spite of all.Perhaps 
next month.Then it will be the month of April or of May.For 
the year is still young, a thousand little signs tell me so.Perhaps 
I am wrong, perhaps I shall survive Saint John the Baptist’s Day 
and even the Fourteenth of July, festival of freedom.Indeed I 
would not put it past me to pant on to the Transfiguration, 
not to speak of the Assumption.But I do not think so, I 
do not think I am wrong in saying that these rejoicings will 
take place in my absence, this year.I have that feeling, I 
have had it now for some days, ami I credit it.But in what does 
it differ from those that have abused me ever since I was born?No, that is the kind of bait I do not rise to any more, my need 
for prettiness is gone.

I could die to-day, if I wished, merely by 
making a little effort.But it is just as well to let myself die, quietly, 
without rushing things.Something must have changed.I will not 
weigh upon the balance any more, one way or the other.I shall be 
neutral and inert.No difficulty there.Throes are the only trouble.180

to be sum, quietly crying and laughing, without working myself 
up into a state.Yes I shall be natural at last, I shall sufTer more, 
then less, without drawing any conclusions, I shall pay less heed 
to myself, I shall be neither hot nor cold any more, I shah be 
tepid, I shall die tepid, without enthusiasm.I shall not watch 
myself die, that would spoil everything.Have I watched myself 
live?Have I ever complained?Then why rejoice now?T am con-

SAMUEL BECKETT
But reason has not much hold on me, just now.All things run 
together to encourage me.But can I really resign myself to the 
possibility of my dying without leaving an inventory behind?There I am back at my old quibbles.Presumably 1 can, since I 
intend tc^ake the risk.All my life long I have put off this reckon- 
ing, saying.Too soon, too soon.Well it is still too soon.All my 
life long I have dreamt of the moment when, edified at last, in so 
far as one can be before all is lost, I might draw the line and make 
the tot.This moment seems now at hand.I shall not lose my head 
on that account.So first of all my stories and then, last of all, if 
all goes well, my inventory.And I shall begin, that they may 
plague me no more, with the man and woman.

That will be the 
first story, there is not matter there for two.There will therefore 
be only three stories after all, that one, then the one about the 
animal, then the one about the thing, a stone probably.That is 
all very clear.Then I shall deal with my possessions.If after all 
that I am still alive I shall take the necessary steps to ensure my 
not having made a mistake.So much for that.1 used not to know 
where I was going, but I knew I would arrive, 1 knew there would 
be an end to the long blind road.What half-truths, my God.No 
matter.It is playtime now.I find it hard to get used to that idea.The old fog calls.Now the case is reversed, the way well charted 
and little hope of coming to its end.But I have high hopes.What 
am I doing now, I wonder, losing time or gaining it?I have also 
decided to remind myself briefly of my present slate before em- 
barking on my stories.I think this is a mistake.It is a weakness.But I shall indulge in it.I shall play with all the more ardour 
afterwards.And it will be a pendant to the inventory.Aesthetics 
are therefore on my side, at least a certain kind of aesthetics.For 
I shall have to become earnest again to be able to speak of my 
possessions.There it is then divided into five, the time that 
remains.Into five what?I don’t know.Everything divides into 
itself, I suppose.If I start trying to think, again I shall make a 
mess of my decease.I must say there is something very attractive 
about such a prospect.But I am on my guard.Summarization models summary:

An occasional interlude is to be feared.A full programme.I shall 
not deviate from it any further than I must.So much for that.I 
feel I am making a great mistake.No matter.Present state.This room seems to be mine.I can find no 
other explanation to my being left in it.All this time.Unless it 
be at the behest of one of the powers that be.That is hardly likely.Why should the powers have changed in their attitude towards 
me?It is better to adopt the simplest explanation, even if it is 
not simple, even if it does not explain very much.A bright light 
is not necessary, a taper is all one needs to live in strangeness, if 
it faithfully burns.Perhaps I came in for the room on ihe death 
of whoever was in it before me.I enquire no further in any case.It is not a room in a hospital, or in a madhouse, I can feel that.I have listened at different hours of the day and night and never 
heard anything suspicious or unusual, but always the peaceful 
sounds of men at large, getting up, lying down, preparing food, 
coming and going, weeping and laughing, or nothing at all, no 
sounds at all.And when I look out of the window it is clear to me 
from certain signs, that I am not in a house of rest in any sense 
of the word.No, this is just a plain private room apparently, in 
what appears to be a plain ordinary house.I do not remember 
how I got here.In an ambulance perhaps, a vehicle of some kind 
certainly.

One day I found myself here, in the bed.Having prob- 
ably lost consciousness somewhere, I benefit by a hiatus in my 
recollections, not to be resumed until I recovered my senses, in this 
bed.As to the events that led up to my fainting and to which I 
can hardly have been oblivious, at the time, they have left no 
discernible trace, on my mind.But who has not experienced such 
lapses?They are common after drunkenness.I have often amused 
myself with trying to invent them, those same lost events.But 
without succeeding in amusing myself really.But what is the last 
thing I remember, I could start from there, before I came to my 
senses again here?That too is lost.I was walking certainly, all 
my life I have been walking, except the first few months and 
since I have been here.But at the end of the day I did not know 
where I had been or what my thoughts had been.What then 
could I be expected to remember, and with what?I remember a184

for me was never any great loss.But perhaps I was stunned with 
a blow, on the head, in a forest perhaps, yes now that I speak of 
a forest I vaguely remember a forest.All that belongs to the past.Now it is the present I must establish, before I am avenged.It is

dying, L could well believe myself dead, expiating my sins, or in 
one of heaven’s mansions.But I feel at last that the sands are 
running out, which would not be the case if I were in heaven, or 
in hell.Beyond the grave, the sensation of being beyond the grave 
was stronger with me six months ago.Had it been foretold to me 
that one day I should feel myself living as I do to-day, I should 
have smiled.It would not have been noticed, but I would have 
known I was smiling.I remember them well, these last few days, 
they have left me more memories than the thirty thousand odd 
that went before.The reverse would have been less surprising.When I have completed my inventory, if my death is not ready for 
me then, I shall write my memoirs.That’s funny, I have made a 
joke.No matter.There is a cupboard I have never looked into.My possessions are in a corner, in a little heap.With my long 
stick I can rummage in them, draw them to me, send them back.My bed is by the window.I lie turned towards it most of the

not see any fields or hills.And yet they are near.But are they 
near?I don’t know.I do not see the sea either, but I hear it when 
it is high.I can see into a room of the house across the way.Queer things go on there sometimes, people are queer.Perhaps 
these are abnormal.They must see me too, my big shaggy head 
up against the window-pane.

I never had so much hair as now, 
nor so long, I say it without fear of contradiction.But at night 
they do not see me, for I never have a light.I have studied the

and perch on the window-sill, asking for food!It is touching.They rap on the window-pane, with their beaks.I never give them 
anything.But they still come.What are they waiting for?They 
are not vultures.Not only am I left here, but I am looked after!This is how it is done now.The door half opens, a hand puts a 
dish on the little table left there for that purpose, takes away the 
dish of the previous day, and the door closes again.This is done 
for me every day, at the same time probably.When I want to eat

table beside the dish.Then I go twenty-four hours without a pot.No, I have two pots.They have thought of everything.I am 
naked in the bed, in the blankets, whose number I increase and 
diminish as the seasons come and go.I am never hot, never cold.I don’t wash, but I don’t get dirty.If I get dirty somewhere I rub 
the part with my finger wet with spittle.What matters is to eat 
and excrete.Dish and pot, dish and pot, these arc the poles.In 
the beginning it was different.The woman came right into the 
room, bustled about, enquired about my needs, my wants.I 
succeeded in the end in getting them into her head, my needs and 
my wants.It was not easy.She did not understand.Until the day 
I found the terms, the accents, that fitted her.All that must be 
half imagination.It was she who got me this long stick.It has a 
hook ?: one end.Thanks to it I can control the furthest recesses 
of my abode.How gjeat is my debt to sticks!So great that I 
almost forget the blows they have transferred to me.She is an 
old woman.I don’t know why she is good to me.Yes, let us call it 
goodness, without quibbling.For her it is certainly goodness.I 
believe her to be even older than I.But rather less well preserved,186

in spite of her mobility.

Perhaps she goes with the room, in a 
manner of speaking.In that case she does not call for separate 
study.But it is conceivable that she does what she does out of 
sheer charity, or moved with regard to me by a less general feel- 
ing of compassion or affection.Nothing is impossible, I cannot 
keep on denying it much longer.But it is more convenient to 
suppose that when I came in for the room I came in for her too.All I see of her now is the gaunt hand and part of the sleeve.Not even that, not even that.Perhaps she is dead, having pre- 
deceased- me, perhaps now it is another’s hand that lays and clears 
my little table.I don’t know how long I have been here, I must 
have said so.All I know is that I was very old already before I 
found myself here.I call myself an octogenarian, but I cannot 
prove it.Perhaps I am only a quinquagenarian, or a quadragen- 
arian.It is ages since I counted them, my years I mean.I know 
the year of my birth, I have not forgotten that, but I do not know 
what year I have got to now.But I think I have been here for 
some very considerable time.For there is nothing the various 
seasons can do to me, within the shelter of these walls, that I do 
not know.That is not to be learnt in one year or two.In a flicker 
of my lids whole days have flown.Does anything remain to be 
said?A few words about myself perhaps.My body is what is 
called, unadvisedly perhaps, impotent.There is virtually nothing 
it can do.Summarization models summary:

uncared for.I might perhaps grow vegetables, he said.They cost 
less to buy, said his wife.Sapo marvelled at these conversations.Think of the price of manure, said his mother.And in the silence 
which followed Mr. Saposcat applied his mind, with the earnest- 
ness he brought to everything he did, to the high price of manure 
which prevented him from supporting his family in greater com- 
fort, while his wife made ready to accuse herself, in her turn, of 
not doing all she might.But she was easily persuaded that she 
could not do more without exposing herself to the risk of dying 
before iier time.Think of the doctor’s fees we save, said Mr. 
Saposcat.And the chemist’s bills, said his wife.Nothing remained 
but to envisage a smaller house.But we are cramped as it is, said 
Mrs. Saposcat.And it was an understood thing that they would 
be more and more so with every passing year until the day came 
when, the departure of the first-born compensating the arrival of the 
new-born, a kind of equilibrium would be attained.Then little by 
little the house would empty.And at last they would be all alone, 
with their memories.It would be time enough then to move.He 
would be pensioned off, she at her last gasp.They woald take a 
cottage in the country where, having no further need of manure, 
they could afford to buy it in cartloads.

And their children, 
grateful for the sacrifices made on their behalf, would come to 
their assistance.It was in this atmosphere of unbridled dream that 
these conferences usually ended.It was as though the Saposcats 
drew the strength to live from the prospect of their impotence.But sometimes, before reaching that stage, they paused to consider 
the case of their first-born.What age is he now?asked Mr. 
Saposcat.His wife provided the information, it being understood 
that this was of her province.She was always wrong.Mr. Saposcat 
took over the erroneous figure, murmuring it over and over to 
himself as though it were a question of the rise in price of some 
indispensable commodity, such as butcher’s meat.And at the same 
time he sought in the appearance of his ^on some alleviation of 
what he had just heard.Was it at least a nice sirloin?Sapo looked 
at his father’s face, sad, astonished, loving, disappointed, con- 
fident in spite of all.Was it on the cruel flight of the years he 
brooded, or on the time it was taking his son to command aMALONE DIES

salary?Sometimes he stated wearily his regret that his son should 
not be more eager to make himself useful about the place.It is 
better for him to prepare his examinations, said his wife.Starting 
from a given theme their minds laboured in unison.They had no 
conversation properly speaking.They made use of tlie spoken 
word in much the same way as the guard of a train makes use of 
his flags, or of his lantern.Or else they said.This is where we get

The first time an 
exasperated master threatened him with a cane, Sapo snatched it 
from his hand and threw it out of the window, which was closed, 
for it was winter.This was enough to justify his expulsion.But 
Sapo was not expelled, either then or later.I must try and discover, 
when I have time to think about it quietly, why Sapo was not 
expelled when he so richly deserved to be.For I want as little as 
possible of darkness in his story.A little darkness, in itself, at the 
time is nothing.You think no more about it and you go on.But I 
know what darkness is, it accumulates, thickens, then suddenly 
bursts and drowns everything.I have not been able to find out why Sapo was not expelled.I shall have to leave this question open.1 try not to be glad.I 
shall make haste to put a safe remove between him and this 
incomprehensible indulgence, I shall make him live as though he 
had been punished according to his deserts.We shall turn our backs 
on this little cloud, but we shall not let it out of our sight.It will 
not cover the sky without our knowing, we shall not suddenly 
raise our eyes, far from help, far from shelter, to a sky as black 
as ink.That is what I have decided.1 sec no other solution.It is 
the best I can do.At the age of fourteen he was a plump rosy boy.His wrists 
and ankles were thick, which made his mother say that one day 
he would be even bigger than his father.Curious deduction.ButMALONE DIES

the most striking thing about him was his big round head horrid 
with flaxen hair as stiff and straight as the bristles of a brush.Even his teachers could not help thinking he had a remarkable 
head and they were all the more irked by their failure to get 
anything into it.His father would say, when in good humour, One 
of these days he will astonish us all.It was thanks to Sapo’s skull 
that he was enabled to hazard this opinion and, in deflance of the 
facts and against his better judgment, to revert to it from time to 
time.But he could not endure the look in Sapo’s eyes and went 
out of his way not to meet it.He has your eyes, his wife would 
say.Then Mr. Saposcat chafed to be alone, in order to inspect his 
eyes in the mirror.They were palest blue.Just a shade lighter, 
said Mrs. Saposcat.Sapo loved nature, took an interest.This is awful.Sapo loved nature, took an interest in animals and plants 
and willingly raised his eyes to the sky, day and night.But he 
did not know how to look at all these things, the looks he rained 
upon them taught him nothing about them.He confused the birds 
with one another, and the trees, and could not tell one crop from 
another crop.He did not associate the crocus with the spring nor 
the chrysanthemum with Michaelmas.The sun, the moon, the 
planets and the stars did not fill him with wonder.He was some- 
times tempted by the knowledge of these strange things, some- 
times beautiful, that he would have about him all his life.Summarization models summary:

what he could brood on thus, hour after hour.His father supposed 
him a prey to the first flutterings of sex.At sixteen I was the

his wife.So I was, said Mr. Saposcat.But in the view of his 
teachers the signs were rather those of besottedness pure and

tedium.Live and cause to live.There is no use idicting words, 
they are no shoddier than what they peddle.After the fiasco, the 
solace, the repose, I began again, to try and live, cause to live, 
be another, in myself, in another.How false all this is.No time 
now to explain.I began again.But little by little with a different 
aim, no longer in order to succeed, but in order to fail.Nuance.What I sought, when I struggled out of my hole, then aloft

of furniture capable of intervening between me and njy posses-

But it so cleaves to the wall, to the 
two walls, for it stands in the comer, that it seems part of them.It may be objected that my button-boot, for it was a kind of 
button-boot, is in the cupboard.I thought of that.But I have 
gone through it, my stick has gone through the cupboard, opening 
the doors, the drawers, for the first time perhaps, and rooting 
everywhere.And the cupboard, far from containing my boot, is 
empty.No, I am now without this boot, just as I am now without 
certain other objects of less value, which I thought I had 
preserved, among them a zinc ring that sho’je like silver.I note 
on the other hand, in the heap, the presence of two or three 
objects I had quite forgotten and one of which at least, the bowl 
of a pipe, strikes no chord in my memory.I do not remember ever 
having smoked a tobacco-pipc.I remember the soap-pipe with 
which, as a child, I used to blow bubbles, an odd bubble.Never 
mind, this bowl is now mine, wherever it comes from.A number 
of my treasures are derived from the same source.I also dis- 
covered a little packet tied up in age-yellowed newspaper.It 
reminds me of something, but of what?I drew it over beside the 
bed and felt it with the knob of my stick.And my hand under- 
stood softness and lightness, better I think than if it had touched 
the thing directly, fingering it and weighing it in its palm.I

pouring of misery, impotence and hate.The forms are many in

was always subject to the deep thought, especially in the spring

the last of mine, as long as it lasts, should have living for its 
theme, that is all, I know what I mean.

of life I shall feel it All I ask is to know, before I abandon him 
whose life has so well begun, that my death and mine alone 
prevents him from living on, from winning, losing, joying, suffer- 
ing, rotting and dying, and that even had I lived he would have 
waited, before he died, for his body to be dead.That is what you 
might call taking a reef in your sails.My body does not yet make up its mind.But I fancy it 
weighs heavier on the bed, flattens and spreads.My breath, when 
it comes back, fills the room with its din, though my chest moves 
no more than a sleeping child’s.I open my eyes and gaze un- 
blinkingly and long at the night sky.So a tiny tot I gaped, first at 
the novelties, then at the antiquities.Between it and me the pane, 
misted and smeared with the filth of years.I should like to 
breathe on it, but it is too far away.It is such a night as Kaspar 
David Friedrich loved, tempestuous and bright.That name that 
comes back to me, those names.The clouds scud, tattered by the 
wind, across a limpid ground.If I had the patience to wait I 
would see the moon.But I have not.Now that I have looked 
I hear the wind.I close my eyes and it mingles with mv breath.Words and images run riot in my head, pursuing, flying, clashing, 
merging, endlessly.But beyond this tumult there is a great calm,

again.Summarization models summary:

fell in December and January, and from February onwards he 
waited impatiently for the return of that season, the principal 
event of which is unquestionably the Saviour’s birth, in a stable, 
while wondering if he would be spared till then.Then he would 
set forth, hugging under his arm, in their case, the great knives so 
lovingly whetted before the fire the night before, and in his pocket, 
wrapped in paper, the apron destined to protect his Sunday suit 
while he worked.And at the thought that he, Big Lambert, was 
on his way towards that distant homestead where all was in readi- 
ness for his coming, and that in spite of his great age he was still 
needed, and his methods preferred to those of younger men, then 
his old heart exulted.From these expeditions he reached home 
late in the night, drunk and exhausted by the long road and the 
emotions of the day.And for days afterwards he could speak of 
nothing but the pig he had just dispatched, 1 would say into the 
other world if I was not aware that pigs have none but this, to 
the great affliction of his family.But they did not dare protest, for 
they feared him.

Yes, at art' age when most people cringe and 
cower, as if to apologize for still being present, Lambert was 
feared and in a position to do as he pleased.And even his young 
wife had abandoned all hope of bringing him to heel, by means of 
her cunt, that trump card of young wives.For she knew what he 
would do to her if she did not open it to him.And he even 
insisted on her making things easy for him, in ways that often 
appeared to her exorbitant.And at the least show of rebellionMALONE DIES

continued to expatiate, to his near and dear ones, of an evening, 
while the lamp burned low, on the specimen he had jus» slaugh- 
tered, until the day he was summoned to slaughter another.Then 
all his conversation was of this new pig, so unlike the other in 
every respect, so quite unlike, and yet at bottom the same.For 
all pigs are alike, when you get to know their little ways, struggle, 
squeal, bleed, squeal, struggle, bleed, squeal and faint away, in 
more or less the same way exactly, a way that is all their own 
and could never be imitated by a lamb, for example, or a kid.But once March was out Big Lambert recovered his calm and 
became his silent self again.The son, or heir, was a great strapping lad»with terrible teeth.The farm.The farm was in a hollow, flooded in winter and in 
summer burnt to a cinder.Summarization models summary:

fatuous of lights.That’s it, babble.How long can it have lasted?Five minutes?Ten minutes?

Yes, no more, not much more.But 
my sliver of sky is silvery with it yet.In the old days I used to 
count, up to three hundred, four hundred, and with other things 
too, the showers, the bells, the chatter of the sparrows at dawn, or 
with nothing, for no reason, for the sake of counting, and then I 
divided, by sixty.That passed the time, I was time, I devoured 
the world.Not now, any more.A man changes.As he gets on.In- the filthy kitchen, with its earth floor, Sapo had his place, 
by the window.Big Lambert and his son left their work, came 
and shook his hand, then went away, leaving him with the mother 
and the daughter.But they too had their work, they too went 
away and left him, alone.There was so much work, so little time, 
so few hands.The 4 voman, pausing an instant between two tasks, 
or in the midst of one, flung up her arms and, in the same breath, 
unable to sustain their great weight, let them fall again.Then she 
began to toss them about in a way difficult to describe, and not 
easy to understand.The movements resembled those, at once 
frantic and slack, of an arm shaking a duster, or a rag, to rid it 
of its dust.And so rapid was the trepidation of the limp, empty 
hands that there seemed to be four or five at the end of each arm, 
instead of the usual one.At the same time angry unanswerable 
questions, such as.What’s the use?fell from her lips.Her hair

task.Sapo remained alone, by the window, the bowl of goat’s 
milk on the table before him, forgotten.It was summer.The room 
was dark in spite of the door and window open on the great 
outer light.Through these narrow openings, far apart, the light 
poured, lit up a little space, then died, undiffused.It had no 
steadfastness, no assurance of lasting as long as day lasted.But it 
entered at every moment, renewed from without, entered and died 
at every moment, devoured by the dark.

And at the least abate-

in it was visible any more.For the dark had triumphed.And Sapo, 
his face turned towards an earth so resplendent that it hurt his 
eyes, felt at his back and all about him the uflconquerable dark, 
and it licked the light on his face.Sometimes abruptly he turned 
to face it, letting it envelop and pervade him, with a kind of 
relief.Then he heard more clearly the sounds of those at work, 
the daughter calling to her goats, the father cursing his mule.But 
silence was in the heart of the dark, the silence of dust and the 
things that would never stir, if left alone.And the ticking of the 
invisible alarm-clock was as the voice of that silence which, like 
the dark, would one day triumph too.And then all would be still 
and dark and all things at rest for ever at last.Finally he took 
from his pocket the few poor gifts he had brought, laid them on 
the table and went.But it sometimes happened, before he decided 
to go, before he went rather, for there was no decision, that a hen, 
taking advantage of the open door, would venture into the room.No sooner had she crossed the threshold than she paused, one 
leg hooked up under her breech, her head on one side, blinking, 
anxious.Then, reassured, she advanced a little further, jerkily, 
with concertina neck.It was a grey hen, perhaps the grey hen.Sapo got to know her»well and, it seemed to him, to be well

necessary, in order that it might be known whether there was 
only one grey hen or more than one, was for someone to be 
present when all the hens came running towards Mrs. Lambert as 
she cried.Tweet!Tweet!, and banged on an old tin with an old 
spoon.But after a&I what use would that have been?For it was 
quite possible there were several grey hens, and yet only one in 
the habit of coming to the kitchen.And yet the experiment was 
worth making.For it was quite possible there was only one grey 
hen, even at feeding-time.Which would have clinched the matter.And yet that is a thing that will never be known.

For among 
those who must have known, some arc dead and the others have 
forgotten.And the day when it was urgent for Sapo to have this 
point cleared up, and his mind set at rest, it was too late.Then he 
was sorry he had not understood, in time to profit by it, the 
importance that those hours were one day to assume, for him, 
those long hours in that old kitchen where, neither quite indoors 
nor quite out of doors, he waited to be on his feet again, and in 
motion, and while waiting noted many things, among them this 
big, anxious, ashen bird, poised irresolute on the bright threshold, 
then clucking and clawing "behind the range and fidgeting her 
atrophied wings, soon to be sent flying with a broom and angry 
cries and soon to return, cautiously, with little hesitant steps, 
stopping often to listen, opening and shutting her little bright black 
eyes.And so he went, all unsuspecting, with the fond impression 
of having been present at everyday scenes of no import.He 
stooped to cross the threshold and saw before him the well, with 
its winch, chain and bucket, and often too a long line of tatteredMALONE DIES

path he had come by, along the edge of the meadow in the

Or the Lamberts saw him, from far off or from near by, or 
some of them from far off and the others from near by, suddenly 
emerge from behind the washing and set off down the path.Then 
they did not try to detain him or even call goodbye, unresentful 
at his leaving them in a way that seemed so lacking in friendliness, 
for they knew he meant no harm.Or if at the time they could 
not help feeling a little hurt, this feeling was quite dispelled a 
little later, when they found on the kitchen-table the crumpled 
paper-bag containing a few little articles of haberdashery.And 
these humble presents, but oh how useful, and this oh so delicate 
way of giving, disarmed them too at the sight of the bowl of 
goat’s milk only half emptied, or left untouched, and prevented 
them from regarding this as an affront, in the way tradition 
required.But it would appear on reflection that Sapo’s departure 
can seldom have escaped them.For at the least moment within 
sight of their land, were it only that of a little bird alighting or 
taking to wing, they raised their heads and stared with wide eyes.And even on the road, of which segments were visible more than 
a mile away, nothing could happen without their knowledge, and 
they were able not only to identify all those who passed along it 
and whose remoteness reduced them to the size of a pin’s head, 
but also to divine whence they were coming, where they were 
going, and for what purpose.

Then they cried the news to one 
another, for they often worked at a great distance apart, or they 
exchanged signals, all erect and turned towards the event, for it 
was one, before bowing themselves down to the earth again.And 
at the first spell of rest taken in common, about the table or 
elsewhere, each one gJIve his version of what had passed and 
listened to those of the others.And if at first they were not in 
agreement about what they had seen, they talked it over doggedly 
until they were, in agreement I mean, or until they resigned them- 
selves to never being so.It was therefore difficult for Sapo to glide206

away unseen, even in the deep shadow of the trees that bordered 
the stream, even supposing him to have been capable of gliding, 
for his movements were rather those of one floundering in a quag.And all raised their heads and watched him as he went, then 
looked aft one another, before stooping to the earth again.And on 
each face bent to the earth there played perhaps a little smile, a 
little rictus rather, but without malice, each wondering perhaps 
if the others felt the same thing and making the resolve to ask 
them, at their next meeting.But the face of Sapo as he stumbled 
away, "now in the shadow of the venerable trees he could not 
name, now in the brightness of the waving meadow, so erratic 
was his course, the face of Sapo was as always grave, or rather 
expressionless.And when he halted it was not the better to think, 
or the closer to pore upon his dream, but simply because the voice 
had ceased that tefld him to go on.Summarization models summary:

stared down at the earth, blind to its beauty, and to its utility, 
and to the little wild many-coloured flowers happy among the 
crops and weeds.But these stations were short-lived, for he was 
still young.And of a sudden lie is off again, on his wanderings, 
passing from light to shadow, from shadow to light, unhcedingly.When I stop, as just now, the noises begin again, strangely 
loud, those whose turn it is.So that I seem to have again the 
hearing of my boyhood.Then in my bed, in the dark, on stormy 
nights, I could tell from one another, in the outcry without, the 
leaves, the boughs, the groaning trunks, even the grasses and the 
house that sheltered me.Each tree had its own cry, just as no 
two whispered alike, when the air was still.1 heard afar the iron 
gates clashing and dragging at their posts and the wind rushing 
between their bars.There was nothing, not even the sand on the 
paths, that did not utter its 'try.The still nights too, still as the 
grave as the saying is, were nights of storm for me, clamorous 
with countless pantings.These I amused myself with identifying, 
as I lay there.Yes, I got great amusemtnt, when young, from 
their so-called silence.The sound I liked best had nothing noble 
about it.It was the barking of the dogs, at night, in the clusters 
of hovels up in the hills, where the stone-cutters lived, like genera- 
tions of stone-cutters before them.It came down to me where IMALONE DIES

lay, in the house in the plain, wild and soft, at the limit of earshot, 
soon weary.The dogs of the valley replied with their gross bay 
all fangs and jaws and foam.From the hills another joy came 
down, I mean the brief scattered lights that sprang up on their 
slopes at nightfall, merging in blurs scarcely brighter thar^the sky, 
less bright than the stars, and which the palest moon extinguished.They were things that scarcely were, on the confines of silence 
and dark, and soon ceased.So I reason now, at my ease.Standing 
before my high window I gave myself to them, waiting for them 
to end, for my joy to end, straining towards the joy of ended joy.But our business at the moment is less with these futilities than 
with my ears from which there spring two impetuous tufts of no 
doubt yellow hair, yellowed by wax and lack of care, and so long 
that the lobes are hidden.I note then, without emotion, that of 
late their hearing seems to have improved.Oh #iot that I was ever 
even incompletely deaf.But for a long time now I have been 
hearing things confusedly.There I go again.What I mean is 
possibly this, that the noises of the world, so various in themselves 
and which I used to be so clever at distinguishing from one 
another, had been dinning at me for so long, always the same old 
noises, as gradually to have merged into a single noise, so that all 
I heard was one vast continuous buzzing.The volume of sound 
perceived remained no doubt the same, I had simply lost the 
faculty of decomposing it.Summarization models summary:

write, but I had to resign myself to it in the end.It is in order to 
know where I have got to, where he has got to.At first I did not 
write, I just said the thing.Then I forgot what I had said.A 
minimum of memory is indispensable, if one is to live really.Take hif family, for example, I really know practically nothing 
about his family any more.But that does not worry me, there is 
a record of it somewhere.It is the only way to keep an eye on 
him.But as far as I myself am concerned the same necessity does 
not arise, or does it?

And yet I write about myself with the same 
pencil and in the same exercise-book as about him.It is because 
it is no longer I, I must have said so long ago, but another whose 
life is just beginning.It is right that he too should have his little 
chronicle, his memories, his reason, and be able to recognize the 
good in the bad, the bad in the worst, and so grow gently old all 
down the unchanging days and die one day like any other day, 
only shorter.That is my excuse.But there must be others, no less 
excellent.Yes, it is quite dark.I can see nothing.I can scarcely 
even see the window-pane, or the wall forming with it so sharp 
a contrast that it often looks like the edge of an abyss.I hear the 
noise of my little finger as it glides over the paper and then that 
so different of the pencil following after.That is what surprises 
me and makes me say that something must have changed.Whence 
that child I might have been, why not?And 1 hear also, there we

when it goes soft.It is a song I know, I don't know how, and 
when it fades, and when it dies quite away, it goes on inside me, 
but too slow, or too fast, for when it comes on the air to me again 
it is not together with mine, but behind, or ahead.It is a mixed

stilled within me, could not this song have simply been to the 
honour and glory of him who was the first to rise from the dead.MALONE DIES 209to him who saved me, twenty centuries in advance?Did I say the 
first?The final bawl lends colour to this view.I fear I must have fallen asleep again.In vain I grope, I can- 
not find my exercise-book.But I still have the pencil in my hand.I shall have to wait for day to break.God knows what I «m going 
to do till then.I have just written, I fear I must have fallen, etc.I hope this 
is not too great a distortion of the truth.I now add these few lines, 
before departing from myself again.I do not depart from myself 
now with the same avidity as a week ago for example.For this 
must be going on now for over a week, it must be over a week since 
I said, I shall soon be quite dead at last, etc.Wrong again.That 
is not what I said, I could swear to it, that is what I wrote.This 
last phrase seems familiar, suddenly I seem to have written it 
somewhere before, or spoken it, word for word.

Yes, I shall soon 
be, etc., that is what I wrote when I realised I did not know what 
I had said, at the beginning of my say, and subsequently, and that 
consequently the plan I had formed, to live, and cause to live, at 
last, to play at last and die alive, was going the way of all my 
other plans.I think the dawn was not so slow in coming as I had 
feared, I really do.But I feared nothing, I fear nothing any more.High summer is truly at hand.Turned towards the window I saw 
the pane shiver at last, before the ghastly sunrise.It is no ordinary 
pane, it brings me sunset and it brings me sunrise.The exercise- 
book had fallen to the ground.I took a long time to find it.It 
was under the bed.How are such things possible?I took a long 
time to recover it.I had to harpoon it.It is not pierced through 
and through, but it is in a bad way.It is a thick exercise-book.I 
hope it will see me out.From now on I shall write on both 
sides of the page.Where docs it come from?I don’t know.I found 
it, just like that, the day I needed it.Knowing perfectly well I had 
no exercise-book I rummaged in my possessions in the hope of 
finding one.I was not ^disappointed, not surprised.If tomorrow I 
needed an old love-letter I would adopt the same method.It is 
ruled in squares.The first pages are covered with ciphers and

The summer holidays were drawing to a close.The decisive 
moment was at hand when the hopes reposed in Sapo were to be 
fulfilled, or dashed to the ground.He is trained to a hair, said 
Mr. Saposcat.And Mrs. Saposcat, whose piety grew warm in 
times of crisis, prayed for his success.Kneeling at her bedside, in 
her night-dress, she ejaculated, silently for her husband would not 
have approved.Oh God grant he pass, grant he pass, grant he 
scrape through!When this first ordeal was surmounted there would be others, 
every year, several times a year.But it seemed to the Saposcats 
that these would be less terrible than the c lirst which was to give 
them, or deny them the right to say, He is doing his medicine, or.He is reading for the bar.For they felt that a more or less normal

count.A Bird.I shall give it to him on the morning of the ex- 
amination, he said.He took off the long cardboard lid and showed 
the pen to his wife.Leave it in its box!he cried, as she made to

containing the instructions for use.Mr. Saposcat parted the edges

before, to give him time to get used to the nib?You are right, he 
said, I had not thought of that.Or even two days before, she said, 
to give him time to change the nib if it does not suit him.A bird, 
its yellow beak agape to show it was singing, adorned the lid, 
which Mr. Saposcat now put on again.He wrapped with expert

band.He was not pleased.It is a medium nib, he said, and it will 
certainly suit him.This conversation was renewed the next day.Mr. Saposcat

him he could keep it for his own, if he passed?Then we must do 
so at once, said Mrs. Saposcat, otherwise there is no point in it.To which Mr. Saposcat, made, after a silence, a first objection, 
and then, after a second silence, a second objection.He first 
objected that his son, if he received the pen forthwith, would 
have time to break it, or lose it, before the paper.He secondly 
objected that his son, if he received the pen immediately, and

his mouth, and joined him.Lambert then climbed out of the hole 
and the son went down into it.Drawing closer Sapo saw the 
mule’s black corpse.Then all became clear to him.The mule was 
lying on its side, as was to be expected.The forelegs were stretched 
out straight and rigid, the hind drawn up under the belly.The 
yawning jaws, the wreathed lips, the enormous teeth, the bulging 
eyes, composed a striking death’s-head.Edmund handed up to 
his father the pick, the shovel and the spade and climbed out of 
the hole.Together*ihev dragged the mule bv the legs to the edge

the hole.Sapo stood watching him.A great calm stole over him.Great calm is an exaggeration.He felt better.The end of a life is 
always vivifying.Edmund paused to rest, leaned panting on the 
spade and smiled.There were great pink gaps in his front teeth.Big Lambert sat by the window, smoking, drinking, watching his 
son.Sapo sat down before him, laid his hand on the table and 
his head on his hand, thinking he was alone.Between his head and 
his hand he slipped the other hand and sat there marble still.Louis began to talk.He seemed in good spirits.The mule, in his 
opinion, had died of old age.He had bought it, two years before, 
on its way to the slaughter-house.So he could not complain.After 
the transaction the owner of the mule predicted that it would 
drop down dead at the first ploughing.But Lambert was a con- 
noisseur of mules.In the case of mules it is the eye that counts, 
the rest is unimportant.So he looked the mule full in the eye, at 
the gates of the slaughter-house, and saw it could still be made 
to serve.And the mule returned his gaze, in the yard of the 
slaughter-house.As Lambert unfolded his story the slaughter-MALONE DIES

house loomed larger and larger.

Thus the site of the transaction 
shifted gradually from the road that led to the slaughter-house to 
the gates of the slaughter-house and thence to the yard itself.Yet a little while and he would have contended for the mule with 
the knacker.The look in his eye, he said, was like a jrayer to 
me to take him.It was covered with sores, but in the case of 
mules one should never let oneself be deterred by senile sores.Someone said.He’s done ten miles already, you’ll never get him 
home, he’ll drop down dead on the road.I thought I might screw 
six months out of him, said Lambert, and I screwed two years.All 
the time he told this story he kept his eyes fixed on his son.There they sat, the table between them, in the gloom, one speak- 
ing, the other listening, and far removed, the one from what he 
said, the other from what he heard, and far from each other.The 
heap of earth was dwindling, the earth shope strangely in the 
raking evening light, glowing in patches as though with its own 
fires, in the fading light.Edmund stopped often to rest, leaning 
on the spade and looking about him.The slaughter-house, said 
Lambert, that’s where I buy my beasts, will you look at that 
loafer.He went out and set to work, beside his son.They worked 
together for a time, heedless of each other.Then the son dropped 
his shovel, turned aside and moved slowly away, passing from toil 
to rest in a single unbroken movement that did not seem of his 
doing.The mule was no longer visible.Summarization models summary:

The face of the earth, on 
which it had plodded its life away, would see it no more, toiling 
before the plough, or the dray.And Big Lambert would soon 
be able to plough and harrow the place where it lay, with another 
mule, or an old horse, or an old ox, bought at the Knacker’s yard, 
knowing that the share would not turn up the putrid flesh or be 
blunted by the big bones.For he knew how the dead and buried 
tend, contrary to what one might expect, to rise to the surface, in 
which "they resemble the drowned.And he had made allowance 
for this when digging Jhe hole.Edmund and his mother passed 
each other by in silence.She had been to see a neighbour, to 
borrow a pound of lentils for their supper.She was thinking of 
the handsome steelyard that had served to weigh them and 
wondering if it was true.Before her husband too she rapidly214
SAMUEL BECKETT
passed, without a glance, and in his attitude there was nothing to 
suggest that he had seen her either.She lit the lamp where it 
stood at its usual place on the chimney-piece, beside the alarm- 
clock flanked in its turn by a crucifix hanging from a nail.The 
clock, be : ng the lowest of the three, had to remain in the middle, 
and the lamp and crucifix could not change places because of 
the nail from which the latter was hung.She stood with her fore- 
head and her hands pressed against the wall, until she might turn 
up the wick.She turned it up and put on the yellow globe which 
a larger hole defaced.

Seeing Sapo she first thought he was her 
daughter.Then her thoughts flew to the absent one.She set down 
the lamp on the table and the outer world went out.She sat down, 
emptied out the lentils on the table and began to sort them.So 
that soon there were two heaps on the table, one big heap getting 
smaller and one snrall heap getting bigger.But suddenly with a 
furious gesture she swept the two together, annihilating thus in 
less than a second the work of two or three minutes.Then she 
went away and came back with a saucepan.It won’t kill them, 
she said, and with the heel of her hand she brought the lentils to 
the edge of the table and over the edge into the saucepan, as if 
all that mattered was not to be killed, but so clumsily and with 
such nervous haste that a great number fell wide of the pan to 
the ground.Then she took up the lamp and went out to fetch 
wood perhaps, or a lump of fat bacon.Now that it was dark 
again in the kitchen the dark outside gradually lightened and 
Sapo, his eye against the window-pane, was able to discern certain 
shapes, including that of Big Lambert stamping the ground.To 
stop in the middle of a tedious and perhaps futile task was some- 
thing that Sapo could readily understand.For a great number of 
tasks arc of this kind, without a doubt, and the only way to end 
them is to abandon them.She could have gone on sorting her 
lentils all night and never achieved her purpose, which was to 
free them from all admixture.But in tH end she would have 
stopped, saying, I have done all I can do.Summarization models summary:

by the ears, and disposed in the most convenient position to 
receive the blow, whether on the back of the neck or on some 
other part.And often you strike a corpse, without knowing it.For you have just seen the rabbit alive and well behind the wire

having succeeded with the first blow, and not caused unnecessary 
suffering, whereas in reality you have taken all that trouble for 
nothing.This occurs most frequently at night, fright being greater

worn table at which her family would soon be united, waiting for 
her to serve them, and to feel about her, ready for use, the life-

These first three words the bird managed well 
enough, but the celebrated restriction was too much for it, all you 
heard was a series of squawks.This annoyed Jackson, who kept 
nagging at it to begin all over again.Then Polly flew into a rage 
and retreated to a corner of its cage.It was a very fine cage, with 
every convenience, perches, swings, trays, troughs, stairs and 
cuttle-bones.It was even overcrowded, personally I would have 
felt cramped.Jackson called me the merino, I don’t know why, 
perhaps because of the French expression.I could not help think- 
ing that the notion of a wandering herd was better adapted to 
him than to me.But I have never thought anything but wind, the 
same that was never measured to me.relations with Jackson 
were of short duration.I could have put up with him as a friend, 
but unfortunately he found me disgusting, as did Johnson, Wilson, 
Nicholson, and Watson, all whoresons.I then tried, for a space, to 
lay hold of a kindred spirit among the inferior races, red, yellow.MALONE DIES

chocolate, and so on.And if the plague-stricken had been less diffi- 
cult of access I would have intruded on them too, ogling, sidling, 
leering, ineffing and conating, my heart palpitating.With the insane 
too I failed, by a hair’s-breadth.That must have been the way with 
me then.But the point is rather what is the way with r.«e now.When young the old filled me with wonder and awe.Bawling 
babies are what dumbfound me now.

The house is full of them 
finally.Suave mari magno, especially for the old salt.What tedium.And I thought I had it all thought out.If I had the use of my 
body I would throw it out of the window.But perhaps it is the 
knowledge of my impotence that emboldens me to that thought.All hangs together, I am in chains.Unfortunately I do not know 
quite what floor I am on, perhaps I am only on the mezzanine.The doors banging, the steps on the stairs, the noises in the street, 
have not enlightened me, on this subject.All I- know is that the 
living are there, above me and beneath me.It follows at least that 
I am not in the basement.And do I not sometimes see the sky 
and sometimes, through my window, other windows facing it 
apparently?But that proves nothing, I do not wish to prove 
anything.Or so I say.Perhaps after all I am in a kind of vault 
and this space which I take to be the street in reality no more 
than a wide trench or ditch with other vaults opening upon it.But the noises that rise up from below, the steps that come 
climbing towards me?Perhaps there arc other vaults even deeper 
than mine, why not?In which case the question arises again as to 
which floor I am on, there is nothing to be gained by my saying I 
am in a basement if there are tiers of basements one on top of 
another.But the noises that I say rise up from below, the steps 
that I say come climbing towards me, do they really do so?I 
have no proof that they do.Summarization models summary:

To conclude from this that I am a prey

take.And I honestly believe that in this house there are people 
coming and going and »even conversing, and multitudes of fine

paces to and fro forever on the same level, I mean for one not 
only intignorance of his position and consequently of what he is 
to expect, in the way of sounds, but at the same time more than 
half-deaf more than half the time.There is naturally anotherpossibility that does not escape me, though it would be a greatdisappointment to have it confirmed, and that is that I am dead 
already and that all continues more or less as when I was not.Perhaps I expired in the forest, or even earlier.In which case allthe trouble I have been taking for some time past, for what 
purpose I do not clearly recall except that it was in some way 
connected with the feeling that my troubles were nearly over, has 
been to no purpose whatsoever.But my horse-sense tells me I 
have not yet quite ceased to gasp.

And it summons in support of 
this view various considerations having to do for example with the 
little heap of my possessions, my system of nutrition and elimin- 
ation, the couple across the way, the changing sky, and so on.Whereas in reality all that is perhaps nothing but my worms.Take for example the light that reigns in this den and of which 
the least that can be said, really the least, is that it is bizarre.I 
enjoy a kind of night and day, admittedly, often it is even pitch 
dark, but in rather a different way from the way to which I 
fancy I was accustomed, before I found myself here.Example, 
there is nothing like examples, I was once in utter darkness and 
waiting with some impatience for dawn to break, having need of 
its light to see to certain little things which it is difficult to sec 
in the dark.And sure enough little by little the dark lightened and 
I was able to hook with my stick the objects I required.But the 
light, instead of being the dawn, turned out in a very short time 
to be the dusk.And the sun, instead of rising higher and higher 
in the sky as I confidently expected, calmly set, and night, the 
passing of which I had just celebrated after my fashion, calmly 
fell again.Now the reverse, as you might say, I mean day closing

myself to declare that I experienced that too.And yet how often 
I have implored night to fall, all the livelong day, with all my 
feeble strength, and how often day to break, all the livelong night.Summarization models summary:

But before leaving this subject and entering upon another* I feel 
it is my duty to say that it is never light in this place, never really 
light.The light is there, outside, the air sparkles, the granite wall 
across the way glitters with all its mica, the light is against my 
window, but it does not come through.So that here all bathes, I 
will not say in shadow, nor even in half-shadow, but in a kind of 
leaden light that makes no shadow, so that it is hard to say from 
what direction it comes, for it seems to come from all directions 
at once, and with equal force.I am convinced for example that 
at the present moment it is as bright under my bed as it is under 
the ceiling, which admittedly is not saying much, but I need say 
no more.And does not that amount to simply this, that there is 
really no colour in this place, except in so far as this kind of grey 
incandescence may be called a colour?Yes, no doubt one may 
speak of grey, personally I have no objection, in which case the 
issue here would lie between this grey and the black that it over- 
lays more or less, 1 was going to say according to the time of day, 
but no, it does not always seem to depend on the time of day.I 
myself am very grey, I even sometimes have the feeling that I 
emit grey, in the same way as my sheets for example.And my 
night is not the sky’s.Naturally black is black the whole world 
over.

But how is it my little space is not visited by the luminaries 
I sometimes see shining afar and how is it the moon where Cain 
toils bowed beneath his burden never sheds its light on my face?In a word there seems to be the light of the outer world, of those 
who know the sun and moon emerge at such an hour and at 
such another plunge again below the surface, and who rely on 
this, ano who know that clouds are always to be expected but 
sooner or later always jlass away, and mine.But mine too has 
its alternations, I will not deny it, its dusks and dawns, but that is 
what I say, for I too must have lived, once, out there, and there 
is no recovering from that.And when I examine the ceiling and 
walls I see there is no possibility of my making light, artificial222

would have to give me a lamp, or a torch, you know, and I don’t 
know if the air here is of the kind that lends itself to the comedy 
of combustion.Mem, look for a match in my possessions, and 
see if burns.The noises too, cries, steps, doors, murmurs, cease 
for whole days, their days.Then that silence of which, knowing 
what I know, I shall merely say that there is nothing, how shall 
I merely say, nothing negative about it.And softly my little space 
begins to throb again.You may say it is all in my head, and 
indeed sometimes it seems to me I am in a head and that these

brought me the solution and conclusion of the whole sorry business, 
I mean the business of Malone (since that is what I am called 
now) and of the other, for the rest is no business of mine.And 
it was, though more unutterable, like the crumbling away of two 
little heaps of finest sand, or dust, or ashes, of unequal s ; fe, but 
diminishing together as it were in ratio, if that means anything, 
and leaving behind them, each in its own stead, the blessedness 
of absence.While this was going on I was struggling to retrieve 
my pencil, by fits and starts.My pencil.It is a little Venus, still 
green no doubt, with five or six facets, pointed at both ends and 
so short there is just room, between them, for my thumb and the 
two adjacent fingers, gathered together in a little vice.I use the 
two points turn and turn about, sucking them frequently, I love 
to suck.And when they go quite blunt I strip them with my nails 
which are long, yellow, sharp and brittle for want of chalk or is 
it phosphate.So little by little my little pencil dwindles, inevitably, 
and the day is fast approaching when nothing will remain but a 
fragment too tiny to hold.So I write as lightly as I can.But the 
lead is hard and would leave no trace if I wrote too lightly.But

The conversation takes place in a place where an air circulates and waves gather and break, creating a sound similar to an aerial surf.
There is a kind of air that moves and beats against walls and waves, which can be heard beating against the walls and being beaten back by other waves.
The air can create a vacuum in the skull, allowing one to hear the sounds of children, the dying, the lovers, and the cries of the innocent.
If one closes their eyes, one can hear a sudden storm that rises and drowns the voices of the children and the dying and the lovers.

Between a hard lead with which one dare not 
write too lightly, if a trace is to be left, and a soft fat lead which 
blackens the page almost without touching it, what possible 
difference can there be, from the point of view of durability.Ah 
yes, I have my little pastimes.The strange thing is I have another 
pencil, made in France, a long cylinder hardly broached, in the 
bed with me somewhere I think.So I have nothing to worry about, 
on this score.And yet 1 do worry.Now while 1 was hunting for 
my pencil I made a curious discovery.The floor is whitening.I 
struck it several blows with my stick and the sound it gave forth 
was at once sharp and dull, wrong in fact.So it was not without 
some trepidation that I inspected the other great planes, above 
and all about me.And all this time the sand kept trickling away 
and I saying to myself, I f i is gone for ever, meaning of course the 
pencil.And I saw that all these superficies, or should I say in- 
fraficies, the horizontal as well as the perpendicular, though they 
do not look particularly perpendicular from here, had visibly

not when.And this is all the more singular as the tendency of 
things in general is I believe rather to darken, as time wears on, 
with of course the exception of our mortal remains and certain 
parts of the body which lose their natural colour and from which 
the bl^Kxl recedes in the long run.Does this mean there is more 
light here now, now that I know what is going on?

No, I fear 
not, it is the same grey as heretofore, literally sparkling at times, 
then growing murky and dim, thickening is perhaps the word, 
until all things are blotted out except the window which seems in 
a manner of speaking to be my umbilicus, so that I say to myself.When it too goes out I shall know more or less where I am.No, 
all I mean is this, that when I open staring wide my eyes I see at 
the confines of this restless gloom a gleam and shimmering as of 
bones, which was not hitherto the case, to the best of my 
knowledge.And, I can even distinctly remember the paper- 
hangings or wall-paper still clinging in places to the walls and 
covered with a writhing mass of roses, violets and other flowers 
in such profusion that it seemed to me I had never seen so many 
in the whole course of my life, nor of such beauty.But now they 
seem to be all gone, quite gone, and if there were no flowers on 
the ceiling there was no doubt something else, cupids perhaps, 
gone too, without leaving a trace.And while I was busy pursuing 
my pencil a moment came when my exercise-book, almost a 
child’s, fell also to the ground.But it I very soon recovered, slipping 
the hook of my stick into one of the rents in the cover and hoist- 
ing it gently towards me.And during all this time, so fertile in 
incidents and mishaps, in my head I suppose all was streaming 
and emptying away as through a sluice, to my great joy, until 
finally nothing remained, either of Malone or of the other.Summarization models summary:

 SAMUEL BECKETT has always dreamed of living long enough to get acquainted with free carbonic gas.
Samuel is now an old foetus, hoar, impotent, and has rotted his mother.
He fears that his mother will drop him with the help of gangrene and he will land head-foremost in the charnel-house.
Despite his dreams of old age, Samuel will become the living embodiment of death by natural causes,  when he becomes one of the first humans to fall from the atmosphere.   The Earth's crust has been slowly falling out of the sky, in a rapid decline that will make human civilization's very existence impossible on Earth. The scientists warn us that the Earth is in danger of falling out of the sky, and that the Earth's crust is in danger of being blown over by supercolliders traveling at incredibly high speeds.

bench.How did I know it was he?The eyes perhaps.No, I don’t 
know how I knew.I’ll take back nothing.Perhaps it is not he.No matter, he is mine now, living flesh and needless to say male, 
living with that evening life which is like a convalescence, if my 
memories are mine, and which you savour doddering about in the 
wake of the fitful sun, or deeper than the dead, in the corridors 
of the underground railway and the stench of their harassed mobs 
scurrying from cradle to grave to get to the right place at the 
right time.What more do I want?Yes, those were the days, 
quick to night and well beguiled with the search for warmth 
and reasonably edible scraps.And you imagine it will be so till 
the end.But suddenly all begins to rage and roar again, you are 
lost in forests of high threshing ferns or whirled far out on the 
face of wind-swept wastes, till you begin to wonder if you have 
not died without knowing and gone to hell or been born again 
into an even worse place than before.

Then it is hard to believe 
in those brief years when the bakers were often indulgent, at 
close of day, and baking-apples, I was always a great man for 
apples, to be had almost for the whinging if you knew your way 
about, and a little sunshine and shelter for those who direly 
needed them.And there he is as good as gold on the bench, his 
back to the river, and dressed as follows, though clothes don’t 
matter, I know, I know, but he’ll never have any others, if I 
know anything about it.He has had them a long time already, to 
judge by their decay, but no matter, *they are the last.But most 
remarkable of all is his greatcoat, in the sense that it covers him 
completel; and screens him from view.For it is so well buttoned, 
from top to bottom, by 'means of fifteen buttons at the very least, 
set at intervals of three or four inches at the very most, that 
nothing is to be seen of what goes on inside.And even the two 
feet, flat on the ground demurely side by side, even they are partly 
hidden by this coat, in spite of the double flexion of the body,228

For the posture is completely lacking in 
abandon, and but for the absence of bonds you might think he 
was bo^nd to the bench, the posture is so stiff and set in the 
sharpness of its planes and angles, like that of the Colossus of 
Memnon, dearly loved son of Dawn.In other words, when he 
walks, or simply stands stockstill, the tails of this coat literally 
sweep the ground and rustle like a train, when he walks.And 
indeed (his coat terminates in a fringe, like certain curtains, and 
the thread of the sleeves too is bare and frayed into long waving 
strands that flutter in the wind.And the hands too are hidden.For the sleeves of this vast rag arc of a piece with its other parts.But the collar has remained intact, being of velvet or perhaps shag.Now as to the colour of this coat, for colour too is an important 
consideration, there is no good denying it, all that can be said is 
that green predominates.And it might safely be wagered that 
this coat, when new, was of a fine plain green colour, what you 
might call cab green, for there used to be cabs and carriages 
rattling through the town with panels of a handsome bottle green, 
I must have seen them myself, and even driven in them, I would 
not put it past me.But perhaps l am wrong to call this coat a 
greatcoat and perhaps I should rather call it an overcoat or even 
cover-me-down, for that is indeed the impression it gives, that it 
covers the whole body all over, with the exception obviously of 
the head which emerges, lofty and impassive, clear of its embrace.

Yes, passion has marked the face, action too possibly, but it 
seems to have ceased from suffering, for the time being.But one 
never knows, does one?Now with regard to the buttons of this 
coat, they are not so much genuine buttons as little wooden 
cylinders two or three inches long, with a hole in the middle for 
the thread, for one hole is ample, though two and even four are 
more usual, and this because of the inordinate distension of the 
button-holes consequent on wear and tear.And cylinders is per- 
haps an exaggeration, for if some of these little sticks or pegs are 
in fact cylindrical, still more have no definable form.But all arc 
roughly two and a half inches long and thus prevent the lappetsMALONE DIES

from flying apart, all have this feature in common.Now with 
regard to the material of this coat, all that can be said is that it 
looks like felt.And the various dints and bulges inflicted upon it 
by the spasms and contortions of the body subsist long after the 
fit is past.So much for this coat.I’ll tell myself stories Hbout the 
boots another time, if I can.The hat, as hard as iron, superbly 
domed above its narrow guttered rim, is marred by a wide crack 
or rent extending in front from the crown down and intended 
probably to facilitate the introduction of the skull.For coat and 
hat have this much in common, that whereas the coat is too big, 
the hat is too small.Summarization models summary:

And though the edges of the split brim close 
on the brow like the jaws of a trap, nevertheless the hat is 
attached, by a string, for safety, to the topmost button of the 
coat, because, never mind.And were there nothing more to be 
said about the structure of this hat, the important thing would 
still remain unsaid, meaning of course its colour, of which all 
that can be said is this, that a strong sun full upon it brings out 
shimmers of buff and pearl grey and that otherwise it verges on 
black, without however ever really approaching it.AnS it would 
not surprise me to learn that this hat once belonged to a sporting 
gentleman, a turf-man or breeder of rams.And if we now turn 
to consider this coat and this hat, no longer separately, but in 
relation to each other, we are very soon agreeably surprised to 
see how well they are assorted.And it would not surprise me to 
learn that they had been bought, one at the hatter’s, the other at 
the tailor’s, perhaps the same day and by the same toff, for such 
men exist, I mean fine handsome men six foot tall and over and 
all in keeping but the head, small from over-breeding.And it is 
a pleasure to find oneself again in the presence of one of those 
immutable relations between harmoniously perishing terms and 
the effect of which is this, that when weary to death one is almost 
resigned to — I was going to say to the immortality of the soul, 
but I don’t see the connexion.

But to pass on now to the garments 
that really matter, subjacent and even intimate, all that can be 
said is that this for the moment is delicate ground.For Sapo— 
no, I can’t call him that any more, and I even wonder how I was 
able to stomach such a name till now.So then for, let me see.230

the last barges, freighted with empty barrels.The water cradles 
already the distant fires of the sunset, orange, rose and green, 
quenches them in its ruffles and then in trembling pools spreads 
them bright again.His back is turned to the river, but perhaps it 
appears to him in the dreadful cries of the gulls that evening 
assembles, in paroxysms of hunger, round the outflow of the 
sewers, opposite the Bellevue Hotel.Yes, they too, in a last frenzy 
before night and its high crigs, swoop ravening about the offal.But his face is towards the people that throng the streets at this 
hour, their long day ended and the whole long evening before them.The doors open and spew them out, each door its contingent.For

the things they have to do together, things one cannot do alone.So there they are for a few hours in safety.Then the drowsiness, 
the little memorandum book with its little special pencil, the 
yawned goodbyes.

Some even take a cab to get more quickly to 
the rendezvous or, when the fun is over, home or to the hotel, 
where their comfortable bed is waiting for them.Then you see 
the last stage of the horse, between its recent career as a pet 
horse, or a race-horse, or a pack-horse, or a plough-horse, and 
the shambles.It spends most of its time standing still in an attitude 
of dejection, its head hanging as low as the shafts and harness 
permit, that is to say almost to the cobble-stones.But once in 
motion it is transformed, momentarily, perhaps because of the 
memories that motion revives, for the mere fact of running 
and pulling cannot give it much satisfaction* under such con- 
ditions.But when the shafts tilt up, announcing that a fare has 
been taken on board, or when on the contrary the back-hand 
begins to gall its spine, according as the passenger is seated facing 
the way he is going or, what is perhaps even more restful, with 
his back to it, then it rears its head, stiffens its houghs and looks 
almost content.And you see the cabman too, all alone on his 
box ten feet from the ground, his knees covered at all seasons and 
in all weathers with a kind of rug as a rule originally brown, the 
same precisely which he has just snatched from the rump of his 
horse.Furious and livid perhaps from want of passengers, the 
least fare seems to excite him to a frenzy.Then with his huge 
exasperated hands he tears at the reins or, half rising and leaning 
out over his horse, brings them down with a crack all along its 
back.Summarization models summary:

place, by the shortest route or deviously, through the press of 
other misplaced persons.And each one has his reasons, while 
wondering from time to time what they are worth, and if they 
are the^rue ones, for going where he is going rather than some- 
where else, and the horse hardly less darkly than the men, though 
as a rule it will not know where it is going until it gets there, and 
not always even then.And if as suggested it is dusk, then another 
phenomenon to be observed is the number of windows and shop- 
windows that light up an instant, almost after the fashion of the 
setting sun, though that all depends on the season.But for 
Macmann, thank God, he’s still there, for Macmann it is a true 
spring evening, an equinoctial gale howls along the quays bordered 
by high red houses, many of which are warehouses.

Or it is per- 
haps an evening yi autumn and these leaves whirling in the air, 
whence it is impossible to say, for here there are no trees, are per- 
haps no longer the first of the year, barely green, but old leaves 
that have known the long joys of summer and now are good for 
nothing kut to lie rotting in a heap, now that men and beasts have 
no more need of shade, on the contrary, nor birds of nests to lay 
and hatch out in.and trees must blacken even where no heart 
beats, though it appears that some stay green forever, for some 
obscure reason.And it is no doubt all the same to Macmann 
whether it is spring or whether it is autumn, unless he prefers 
summer to winter or inversely, which is improbable.But it must 
not be thought he will never move again, out of this place and 
attitude, for he has still the whole of his old age before him, and 
then that kind of epilogue when it is not very clear what is happen- 
ing and which does not seem to add very much to what has already 
been acquired or to shed any great light on its confusion, but 
which no doubt has its usefulness, as hay is left out to dry before 
being garnered.He will therefore rise, whether he likes it or not.and proceed by other places to another pjacc, and then by others 
still to yet another, unless he comes back here where he seems to 
be snug enough, but one never knows, does one?And so on, on, 
for long years.Because in order not to die you must come and go, 
come and go, unless you happen to have someone who brings you 
food wherever you happen to be, like myself.Summarization models summary:

for perhaps there are three of them, and how it sways and totters,

and white of flesh, then pink that must come from a garment and 
gold too that I haven’t time to understand.So it is not oold they 
are, standing so lighty clad by the open window.Ah how stupid

I’ll see now if

they tackle the titbit.Back and forth, back and forth, that must

electricity.So he lay down, prostrate, after a moment’s hesitation, 
for he could just as easily have lain down supine or, meeting 
himself half-way, on one of his two sides.But he fancied that 
the nape of the neck and the back right down to the loins were 
more vulnerable than the chest and belly, not realizing, any more 
than if he had been a crate of tomatoes, that all these parts are 
intimately and even indissolubly bound up together, at least until 
death do them part, and to many another too of which he had no 
conception, and tli.it a drop of water out of season on the coccyx

into his hat through the crack, Macmann took it off and laid it

cheek to the ground.His hands at the ends of the long out- 
stretched arms clutched the grass, each hand a tuft, with as much 
energy as if he had been spreadeagled against the face of a cliff.Let us by all means continue this description.The rain pelted 
down on his back with the sound first of a drum, but in a short time 
of washing, as when washing is soused gurgling and squelching in 
a tub, and he distinguished clearly and with interest the difference 
in noise of the rain falling on him and falling on the earth.

For 
his ear, which is on the same plane as the cheek or nearly, was

impressed by the posture of the body and the fingers clenched 
as though in torment.And without knowing exactly what his sin 
was he felt full well that living was not a sufficient atonement for 
it or that this atonement was in itself a sin, calling for more 
atonement, and so on, as if there could be anything but life, for 
the living.And no doubt he would have wondered if it was really 
necessary to be guilty in order to be punished but for the memory, 
more and more galling, of his having consented to live in his 
mother, than to leave her.'And this again he could not see as 
his true sin, but as yet another atonement which had miscarried 
and, far from cleansing him of his sin, plunged him in it deeper 
than before.And truth to tell the ideas guilt and punishment 
were confused together in his mind, as those of cause and effect

think and feel correctly, he would suddenly begin to smile for no 
reason, as now, as then, for already it is long since that afternoon, 
in March perhaps, or in November perhaps, in October rather, 
when the rain caught him far from shelter, to smile and give 
thanks for the teeming rain and the promise it contained of stars 
a little later, to light his way and enable him to get his bearings, 
should he wish to do so.For he did not know quite where he was, 
except that he was in a plain, and the mountains not far, nor the 
sea, nor the town, and that all he needed was a dust of light and 
a few fixed stars to enable him to make definite headway towards 
the one, or the other, or the third, or to hold fast where he was, 
in the plain, as he might be pleased to decide.For in order to 
hold fast in the place where you happen to be you need light 
too, unless you go round in circles, which is practically impossible 
in the dark, or halt and wait, motionless, for day to dawn again, 
and then you die of cold, unless it does not happen to be cold.But Macmann would have been more than human, after forty or 
forty-five minutes of sanguine expectation, seeing the rain persist 
as heavy as ever and day recede at last, if he had nof begun to 
reproach himself with what he had done, namely with having lain 
down on the ground instead of continuing on his course, in as 
straight a line as possible, in the hope of chancing sooner or 
later on a tree, or a ruin.

And instead of being astonished at 
such long and violent rain, he was astonished at not having under- 
stood, from the moment the first timid drops began to fall, that it 
was going to rain violently and long and that he must not 
stop and lie down, but on the contrary press forward, as fast 
as his legs could carry him, for he was no more than human, 
than the son and grandson and greatgrandson of humans.But 
between him and those grave and sober men, first bearded, 
then moustached, there was this difference, that his semen 
had never done any harm to anyone.So his link with his 
species was through fiis ascendants only, who were all dead, 
in the fond hope they had perpetuated themselves.But the 
better late than never thanks to which true men, true links, 
can acknowledge the error of their ways and hasten on to the 
next, was beyond the power of Macmann, to whom it some-242
SAMUEL BECKETT
times seemed that he could grovel and wallow in his mortality 
until the end of time and not have done.And without going so 
far as that, he who has waited long enough will wait for ever.And there comes the hour when nothing more can happen and 
nobody «nore can come and all is ended but the waiting that 
knows itself in vain.Perhaps he had come to that.And when (for 
example) you die, it is too late, you have been watting too long, 
you are no longer sufficiently alive to be able to stop.Perhaps he 
had come to that.But apparently not, though acts don’t matter, 
I know, I know, nor thoughts.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
For having reproached himself 
with what he had done, and with his monstrous error of apprecia- 
tion, instead of springing up and hurrying on he turned over on 
his back, thus offering all his front to the deluge.And it was then 
his hair appeared clearly for the first time since his walks bare- 
headed in the smiling haunts of his youth, his hat having re- 
mained in the place which his head had just left.For when, lying 
on your stomach in a wild and practically illimitable part of the 
country, you turn over on your back, then there is a sideways 
movement of the whole body, including the head, unless you 
make a point of avoiding it, and the head comes to rest at x 
inches approximately from where it was before, x being the width 
of the shoulders in inches, for the head is right in the middle of 
the shoulders.But when you are in a narrow bed, I mean one 
just wide enough to contain you, a pallet shall we say, then it is 
in vain you turn over on your back, then back over on your 
stomach, the head remains always in the same place, unless you 
make a point of inclining it to the right or to the left, and some 
there doubtless are who go to this trouble, in the hope of finding 
a little freshness.He tried to look at the dark streaming mass 
which was all that remained*of sky and air, but the rain hurt his 
eyes and shut them.He opened his mouth and lay for a long time 
thus, his mouth open and his hands also and as far apart as 
possible from each other.

For it is a curidtis thing, one tends less 
to clutch the ground when on one’s back than when on one’s 
stomach, there is a curious remark which might be worth follow- 
ing up.And just as an hour before he had pulled up his sleeves

the better to feel the rain pelting down on his palms, also called 
the hollows of the hands, or the flats, it all depends.And in the 
midst — but I was nearly forgetting the hair, which from the point 
of view of colour was to white very much as the hour’s gloom to 
black and from the point of view of length very long what*is more, 
very long behind and very long on either side.And on a dry and 
windy day it would have gone romping in the grass almost like 
grass itself.But the rain glued it to the ground and churned it 
up with the earth and grass into a kind of muddy pulp, not a 
muddy pulp, a kind of muddy pulp.And in the midst of his 
suffering, for one does not remain so long in such a position with- 
out being incommoded, he began to wish that the rain would 
never cease nor consequently his sufferings or pain, for the cause 
of his pain was almost certainly the rain, recumbency in itself 
not being particularly unpleasant, as if there Existed a relation

For 
the rain could cease without his ceasing to suffer, just as he could 
cease to suffer without the rain’s ceasing on that account^ And on 
him already this important quarter-truth was perhaps beginning to 
dawn.For while deploring he could not spend the rest of his life 
(which would thereby have been agreeably abridged) under this 
heavy, cold (without being icy) and perpendicular rain, now 
supine, now prone, he was quarter-inclined to wonder if he was 
not mistaken in holding it responsible for his sufferings and if in 
reality his discomfort was not the effect of quite a different 
cause or set of causes.For people are never content to suffer, 
but they must have heat and cold, rain and its contrary which is 
fine weather, and with that love, friendship, black skin and sexual 
and peptic deficiency for example, in short the furies and frenzies 
happily too numerous to be numbered of the body including the 
skull and its annexes, whatever that means, such as the club-foot, 
in order that they may know very precisely what exactly it is that 
dares prevent their happiness from being unalloyed.And sticklers 
have been met with who had no peace until they knew for certain 
whether their carcinoma was of the pylorus or whether on the 
contrary it was not rather of the duodenum.But these are flights 
for which Macmann was not yet Hedged, and indeed he was244
SAMUEL BECKETT
rather of the earth earthy and ill-fitted for pure reason, especially 
in the circumstances in which we have been fortunate enough to 
circumscribe him.

And to tell the truth he was by temperament 
more reptile than bird and could suffer extensive mutilation and 
survive,*happier sitting than standing and lying down than sitting, 
so that he sat and lay down at the least pretext and only rose 
again when the £lan vital or struggle for life began to prod him 
in the arse again.And a good half of his existence must have been 
spent in a motionlessness akin to that of stone, not to say the 
three quarters, or even the four fifths, a motionlessness at first 
skin-deep, but which little by little invaded, I will not say the vital 
parts, but at least the sensibility and understanding.And it 
must be presumed that he received from his numerous forbears, 
through the agency of his papa and his mama, a cast-iron vegetative 
system, to have itached the age he has just reached and which is 
nothing or very little compared to the age he will reach, as I know 
to my cost, without any serious mishap, I mean one of a nature 
to carry, him off on the spot.For no one ever came to his help, to 
help him avoid the thorns and snares that attend the steps of 
innocence, and he could never count on any other craft than his 
own, any other strength, to go from morning to evening and then 
from evening to morning without mortal hurt.And notably he 
never received any gifts of cash, or very seldom, and very paltry, 
which would not have mattered if he had been able to earn, in 
the sweat of his brow or by making use of his intelligence.Summarization models summary:

He hasn't slept since the storm hit and it was raining so hard at his cabin all night because it was so cold.  He's still wearing a sweater because the storm caused it to rain.  He's also having trouble sleeping because of the wind.  He's also having trouble sleeping because of rainwater. 
 The worst thing about the storm is the blackout. 
 That's exactly what's bothering him because he has a sore throat and a burning nose

when given the job of weeding a plot of young carrots for 
example, at the rate of threepence or even sixpence an hour, it 
often happened that he tore them all up, through absentminded- 
ness, or carried away by I know not what irresistible urge that 
came over him at the sight of vegetables, and even of flowers, 
and literally blinded him to his true interests, the urge to make a 
clean sweep and have nothing before his eyes but a patch of 
brown earth rid of its parasites, it was often more than he could 
resist.Or without going so far as that, suddenly all swam before

which must have their usefulness too, for the earth to favour 
them so, such as squitch beloved of dogs and from which man too 
in his turn has succeeded in extracting a brew, and the hoe fell 
from his hands.And even with such humble occupations as street- 
cleaning to which with hopefulness he had sometimes turned, on 
the off chance of his being a born scavenger, he did not succeed 
any better.And even he himself was compelled to admit that the 
place swept by him looked dirtier at his departure than on his 
arrival, as if a demon had driven him to collect, with the broom, 
shovel and barrow placed gratis at his disposal by the corporation, 
all the dirt and filth which chance had withdrawn from the sight 
of the tax-payer and add them thus recovered to those already 
visible and which he was employed to remove.

distributed on the crown of the street, as though in orcjpr to in- 
spire the greatest possible disgust in the passers-by or provoke 
the greatest possible number of accidents, some fatal, by means 
of the slip.And yet he had done his honest best to give satis- 
faction, taking as his model his more experienced colleagues, 
and doing as they did.But it was truly as if he were not master 
of his movements and did not know what he was doing, while he 
was doing it, nor what he had done, once he had done it.For 
someone had to say to him.Look at what you have done, sticking 
his nose in it so to speak, otherwise he did not realize, but thought 
he had done as any man of good will would have done in his 
place and with very much the same results, in spite of his lack of 
experience.And yet when it came to' doing some little thing for 
himself, as for example when he had to repair or replace one of 
his buttons or pegs, which were not long-lived being mostly of 
green wood and exposed to all the rigours of the temperate zone, 
then he really exhibited a certain dexterity, without the help of 
any other apparatus than his bare hands.And indeed he had 
devoted to these little tasks a great part of his existence, that is

which to tell the truth he did not, particularly, but he had to, for 
obscure reasons known who knows to God alone, though to tell 
the truftl God does not seem to need reasons for doing what he 
does, and for omitting to do what he omits to do, to the same 
degree as his creatures, does he?Such then seemed to be Mac-

pansies or marigolds and leaving one standing and at the same 
time well able to consolidate his boots with willow bark and 
thongs of wicker, so that he might come and go on the earth 
from time to time and not wound himself too sorely on the stones, 
thorns and broken glass piovided by the carelessness or wicked- 
ness of man, with hardly a complaint, for he had to.For he was 
incapable of picking his steps and choosing where to put down 
his feet (which would have permitted him to go barefoot).And 
even had he been so he would have been so to no great purpose, 
so little f was he master of his movements.And what is the good 
of aiming at the smooth and mossy places when the foot, missing 
its mark, comes down on the flints and shards or sinks up to the 
knee in the anv-pads?

But to pass on now to considerations of 
another order, it is perhaps not inappropriate to wish Macmann, 
since wishing costs nothing, sooner or later a general paralysis at 
a pinch the arms if that is conceivable, in a place impermeable as 
far as possible to wind, rain, sound, cold, great heat (as in the 
seventh century) and daylight, with one or two eiderdowns just 
in case and a charitable soul say once a week bearing eating- 
apples and sardines in oil for the purpose of postponing as long 
as possible the fatal hour, it would be wonderful.But in the mean- 
time in the end, the rain ttill falling with unabated violence in 
spite of his having turned over on his back, Macmann grew rest- 
less, flinging himself from side to side as though in a fit of the 
fever, buttoning himself and unbuttoning and finally rolling over 
and over in the same direction, it little matters which, with a 
brief pause after each roll to begin with, and then without break.And in theory his hat should have followed him, seeing it was

came to the town, or the ocean, but not necessarily.Now it was 
not the first time that Macmann rolled upon the ground, but he 
had always done so without ulterior locomotive motive.Summarization models summary:

gliding, jogging, less and less dear, I would hoist it up on the bed 
in such a way as not to break the window or damage the ceiling, 
and at last I would have it in my hands.If it was my hat I might 
put it on, that would remind me of the good old days, though I 
remember them sufficiently well.It has lost its brim, it looks like 
a bell-glass to put over a melon.In order to put it on and take 
it off you have to grasp it like a great ball, between your palms.It is perhaps the only object in my possession the history of which 
I have not forgotten, I mean counting from the day it became 
mine.I know in what circumstances it lost its brim, I was there 
at the time, it was so that I might keep it on while I slept.I 
should rather like it to be buried with me, a harmless whim, but 
what steps should I take?Mem, put it on on the off chance, well 
wedged down, before it is too late.

But all in due time.Should I 
go on I wonder.I feel I am perhaps attributing to myself things I 
no longer possess and reporting as missing others that are not 
missing.And I feel there are others, over there in the corner, 
belonging to a third category, that of those of which 4 know 
nothing and with regard to which therefore there is little danger 
of my being wrong, or of my being right.And I remind myself 
also that since I last went through my possessions much water 
has passed beneath Butt Bridge, in both directions.For I have 
sufficiently perished in this room to know that some things go out, 
and other things come in, through I know not what agency.And 
among those that go out there are some that come back, after a 
more or less prolonged absence, and others that never come back.With the result that, among those that come in, some are familiar 
to me, others not.I don’t understand.And, stranger still, there 
exists a whole family of objects, having apparently very little in 
common, which have never left me, since I have been here, but 
remained quietly in their place, in the corner, as in any ordinary 
uninhabited room.Or elst^they were very quick.How false all that 
rings.But there is no guarantee things will be ever thus.I cannot 
account in any other way for the changing aspect of my posses- 
sions.So that, strictly speaking, it is impossible for me to know, 
from one moment to the next, what is mine and what is not, 
according to my definition.So I wonder if I should go on, I mean252

interpreted in the right quarters, the dish remains empty.One of 
the pots on the other hand remains full, and the other is filling

produce less waste and so eliminate less.The pots do not seem to 
be mine, I simply have the use of them.They answer to the defin-

definition that is at fault.They have each two handles or ears, 
projecting above the rim and facing each other, into which I insert 
my stick.In this way I move my pots about, lift them up and set 
them down.Nothing has been left to chance.Or is it a happy 
chance?I can therefore easily turn them upside down, if I am 
driven to it, and wait for them to empty, as long as necessary.After this passing reference to my pots I feel a little more lively.They are not mine, but I say my pots, as I say my bed, my win-

But I don’t like screaming.I have spoken softly,

multitudes of people that they are walking on top of one another.They do not dare come near me.In that case I could scream my 
head off to no purpose.I shall try all the same.I have tried.I 
heard nothing out of the ordinary.No, I exaggerate, I heard a kind 
of burning croak deep down in the windpipe, as when one has 
heartburn.With practice I might produce a groan, before I die.I am not sleepy any more.In any case I must not sleep any 
more.What tedium.I have missed the ebb.Did I say I only say 
a small proportion of the things that come into my head?I must 
have.I choose those that seem somehow akin.It is not always 
easy.I hope they arc the most important.I wonder if I shall ever 
be able to stop.Perhaps I should throv: away my lead.I could

right.The stick, having slipped, would have plucked me from the 
bed if I had not let it go.It would of course have been better for 
me to relinquish my bed than to lose my stick.But I had not time 
to think.The fear of falling is the source of many a folly.It is a 
disaster.I suppose the wisest thing now is to live it over again, 
meditate upon it and be edified.It is thus that man distinguishes 
himself from the ape and rises, from discovery to discover^', ever

befallen me, a blessing in disguise.How comforting that is.Catastrophe too in the ancient sense no doubt.To be buried in

made of.To know you can do better next time, unrecognizably 
better, and that there is no next time, and that it is a blessing 
there is not, there is a thought to be going on with.I thought I 
was turning my stick to the best possible account, like a monkey 
scratching its fleas with the key that opens its cage.For it is 
obvious to me now that bV making a more intelligent use of my 
stick I might have extracted myself from my bed and perhaps 
even got myself back into it, when tired of rolling and dragging 
myself about the floor or on the stairs.That would have intro- 
duced a little variety into my decomposition.How is it that256

It might just as well 
be at the equator, or one of the poles.No, not quite, for perhaps 
I shall devise a way of retrieving it, I am so ingenious.All is 
not then yet quite irrevocably lost.In the meantime nothing is 
mine any more, according to my definition, if I remember rightly,

it really exists* I did well to stop my inventory, it was a happy 
thought.I feel less weak, perhaps they fed me while I slept.I see the pot, the one that is not full, it is lost to me too.1 
shall doubtless be obliged to forget myself in the bed, as when I 
was a baby.At least I shall not be skelped.But enough about 
me.You would think I was relieved to be without my stick.I 
think I know how I might retrieve it.But something occurs to me.Are they depriving me of soup on purpose to help me die?One 
judges people too hastily.But in that case why feed me during 
my sleep?But there is no proof they have.But if they wished to 
help me would it not be more intelligent to give me poisoned 
soup, large quantities of poisoned soup?Perhaps they fear an 
autopsy.It is obvious they see a long way ahead.That reminds 
me that among my possessions I once had a little phial, un- 
labelled, containing pills.Laxatives?Sedatives?I forget.To turn 
to them for calm and merely obtain a diarrhoea, my, that would 
be annoying.In any case the question does not arise I am calm, 
insufficiently, I still lack a little calm.But enough about me.Summarization models summary:

Why this need of activity?I am growing nervous.One day, much later, to judge by his appearance, Macmann 
came to again, once again, in a kind of asylum.At first he did 
not know it was one, being plunged within it, but he was told so 
as soon as he was in a condition to receive news.They *aid in 
substance.You are now in the House of Saint John of God, with 
the number one hundred and sixty-six.Fear nothing, you are 
among friends.Friends!Well well.Take no thought for anything, 
it is we shall think and act for you, from now forward.We like it.Do not thank us therefore.In addition to the nourishment care- 
fully calculated to keep you alive, and even well, you will receive, 
every Saturday, in honour of our patron, an imperial half-pint of 
porter and a plug of tobacco.Then followed instructions regarding 
his duties and prerogatives, for he was credited with a certain 
number of prerogatives, notwithstanding the bounties showered 
upon him.Stunned by this torrent of civility, for he had eluded 
charity all his days, Macmann did not immediately grasp that he 
was being spoken to.

The room, or cell, in which he lay, was 
thronged with men and women dressed in white.They swarmed 
about his bed, those in the rear rising on tiptoe and craning 
their necks to get a better view of him.The speaker was a man, 
naturally, in the flower and the prime of life, his features stamped 
with mildness and severity in equal proportions, and he wore a 
scraggy beard no doubt intended to heighten his resemblance to 
the Messiah.To tell the truth, yet again, he did not so much read 
as improvise, or recite, to judge by the paper he held in his hand 
and on which from time to time he cast an anxious eye.He finally 
handed this paper to Macmann, together with the stump of an 
indelible pencil, the point of which he first wetted with his lips, 
and requested him to sign, adding thai it was a mere formality.And whei Macmann had obeyed, either because he was afraid 
of being punished if he refused or because he did not realize the 
seriousness of what he was doing, the other took back the paper, 
examined it and said, Mac what?It was then a woman’s voice, 
extraordinarily shrill and unpleasant, was heard to say, Mann, his 
name is Macmann.This woman was standing behind him, so 
that he could not see her, and in each hand she clutched a bar258

and sat down om a chair by the bed.She was a little old woman, 
immoderately ill-favoured of both face and body.She seems 
called on to play a certain part in the remarkable events which, 
I hope, will enable me to make an end.The thin yellow arms 
contorted by some kind of bone deformation, the lips so broad 
and thick that they seemed to devour half the face, were at first 
sight her most revolting features.She wore by way of ear-rings 
two long ivory crucifixes which swayed wildly at the least 
movement of her head.I pause to record that I feel in extraordinary form.Delirium 
perhaps.It seemed probable to Macmann that he was committed to 
the care and charge of this person.Correct.

For it had been 
decreed, by those in authority, that one hundred and sixty-six 
was Moll’s, she having applied for him, formally.She brought 
him food (one large dish* daily, to first hot, then cold), emptied 
his chamber-pot every morning first thing and showed him how to 
wash himself, his face and hands every day, and the other parts 
of the body successively in the course 'of the week, Monday the 
feet, Tuesday the legs up to the knees, Wednesday the thighs, and 
so on, culminating on Sunday with the neck and ears, no, Sunday 
he rested from washing.She swept the floor, shook up the bed

polishing until they shone the frosted lights of the unique window, 
which was never opened.She informed Macmann, when he did 
something, if that thing was permitted or not, and similarly, when 
he remained inert, whether or not he was entitled to.Does this 
mean that she stayed with him all the time?Why no, and m> doubt 
she had other attentions to bestow elsewhere, and other instruc- 
tions to give.But in the early stages, before he had grown used to 
this new tide in his fortune, she assuredly left him alone as little as 
possible and even watched over him part of the night.How 
understanding she was, and how good-natured, appears from the 
following anecdote.One day, not long after his admission, 
Macmann realized he was wearing, instead of his usual accoutre- 
ment, a long loose smock of coarse linen, or possibly drugget.Summarization models summary:

He at once began to clamour loudly for his clothes, including 
probably the contents of his pockets, for he cried.My things!My things!, over and over again, tossing about in the bed and 
beating the blanket with his palms.Then Moll sat down on the 
edge of the bed and distributed her hands as follows, one on top 
of one of Macmann’s, the other on his brow.She was so small 
that her feet did not reach to the floor.When he was a little 
calmer she told him that his clothes had certainly ceased to exist 
and could not therefore be returned to him.With regard to the 
objects found in the pockets, they had been assessed as quite 
worthless and fit only to be thrown away with the exception of a 
little silver knife-rest which he could have back at any time.But 
these declarations so distressed him that she hastened to add, with 
a laugh, that she was only joking and that in reality his clothes, 
cleaned, pressed, mended, strewn with mothballs and folded away 
in a cardboard box bearing his name and number, were as safe as 
if they had been received in deposit »by the Bank of England.But as Macmann continued vehemently to demand his things, as 
if he did ',ot understand a word of what she had just told him, 
she was obliged to invoke the regulations which tolerated on no 
account that an inmate should resume contact with the trappings 
of his derelict days until such time as he might be discharged.But as Macmann continued passionately to clamour for his 
things, and notably for his hat, she left him, saying he was not260

reasonable.

And she came back a little later, holding with the tips 
of her fingers the hat in question, retrieved perhaps from the 
rubbish-heap at the end of the vegetable-garden, for to know 
everything takes too long, for it was fringed with manure and 
seemed to be rotting away.And what is more she suffered him to 
put it on, and even helped him to do so, helping him to sit up in 
the bed and arranging his pillows in such a way that he might 
remain propped up without fatigue.And she contemplated with 
tenderness the old bewildered face relaxing, and in its tod of 
hair the mouth trying to smile, and the little red eyes turning 
timidly towards her as if in gratitude or rolling towards the re- 
covered hat, and the hands raised to set it on more firmly and 
returning to rest trembling on the blanket.And at last a long 
look passed between them and Moll’s lips puffed and parted in a 
dreadful smile, which made Macmann’s eyes waver like those of 
an animal glared on by its master and compelled then finally to 
look away.End of anecdote.This must be the selfsame hat that 
was abandonend in the middle of the plain, its resemblance to it 
is so great, allowance being made for the additional wear and 
tear.Can it be then that it is not the same Macmann at all, after 
all, in spite of the great resemblance (for those who know the 
power of the passing years), both physical and otherwise.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
It is 
true the Macmanns are legion in the island and pride them- 
selves, what is more, with few exceptions, on having one and all, 
in the last analysis, sprung from the same illustrious ball.It is 
therefore inevitable they should resemble one another, now and 
then, to the point of being confused even in the minds of those 
who wish them well and would like nothing better than to tell 
between them.No matter, any old remains of flesh and spirit do, 
there is no sense in stalking people.So long as it is what is called 
a living being you can’t go wrong, you have the guilty one.For 
a long time he did not stir from his bed, not knowing if he could 
walk, or even stand, and fearing to rifii foul of the authorities, 
if he could.Let us then first consider this first phase of Macmann’s 
stay in the House of Saint John of God.We shall then pass on to 
the second, and even to the third, if necessary.A thousand little things to report, very strange, in view of myMALONE DIES

situation, if I interpret them correctly.But my notes have a 
curious tendency, as I realize at last, to annihilate all they purport 
to record.So I hasten to turn aside from this extraordinary heat, 
to jnention only it, which has seized on certain parts of my 
economy, I will not specify which.And to think I was expecting 
rather to grow cold, if anything!This first phase, that of the bed, was characterized by the 
evolution of the relationship between Macmann and his keeper.

There sprang up gradually between them a kind of intimacy 
which, at a given moment, led them to lie together and copulate 
as best they could.For given their age and scant experience of 
carnal love, it was only natural they should not succeed, at the 
first shot, in giving each other the impression they wore made for 
each other.The spectacle was then offered of Macmann trying to 
bundle his sex into his partner’s like a pillow into a pillow-slip, 
folding it in two and stuffing it in with his fingers.But far from 
losing heart they warmed to their work.And though both were 
completely impotent they finally succeeded, summoning to their 
aid all the resources of the skin, the mucus and the imagination, 
in striking from their dry and feeble clips a kind of sombre 
gratification.So that Moll exclaimed, being (at that stage) the more 
expansive of the two.Oh would we had but met sixty years agQ!But on the long road to this what flutterings, alarms and bashful 
fumblings, of which only this, that they gave Macmann some 
insight into the meaning of the expression, Two is company.He 
then made unquestionable progress in the use of the spoken word 
and learnt in a short time to let fall, at the right time, the yesses, 
noes, mores and enoughs that keep love alive.It was also the 
occasion of his penetrating into the enchanted world of reading, 
thanks to the inflammatory letters which Moll brought and put 
into his hands.Summarization models summary: 
Macmann is one of the most famous families in the island and is known for having a strong resemblance to one another.
Macmann has been in a state of fear and uncertainty during his stay in the House of Saint John of God.
During his time in the house, Macmann has developed a deep affection for his keeper, Moll, and has learned to let go of the past and let the present through the use of the spoken word.
The relationship between Macmann and his keeper developed gradually into a kind of intimacy, which led to them having sex together and copulating.
Moll was the more sexually active of the two, but despite their inexperience, they managed to successfully copulate despite being impotent.
