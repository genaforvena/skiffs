Adam Smith and Freud are portrayed as the main characters in the text.
The capitalist State and its relationship with the Urstaat are the main elements of the capitalist representation.
Class represents class bipolarity and class desire and interest.
Deterritorialization and re-territorializations are the two poles of the axiomatic: the despotic symbol and the schizophrenic figure, and the capitalist (coding, overcoding, decoding) are the three great social machines.
Oedipus at Last is an application of the concept of social reproduction and human reproduction focusing on the two orders of images: Oediopus and its limits.

This passage summarizes key themes and characters in a seemingly dense text that explores sociopolitical dynamics through psychological and philosophical lenses. The main characters mentioned are Adam Smith and Freud, representing capitalism's influence on societal structures and psychoanalysis respectively. Their relationship with the Urstaat (likely an allusion to 'the Estates,' referring to a feudal system) forms the basis of capitalist representation within this context.

Class bipolarity represents the contrasting nature of social divisions, while class desire and interest highlight the motivations driving these divisions. Deterritorialization and re-territorializations are presented as two poles of an axiomatic system - one representing despotic symbols and schizophrenic figures, while coding, overcoding, decoding represent three social machines related to capitalism.

Finally, 'Oedipus at Last' is introduced as an application focusing on social reproduction and human reproduction, examining two orders of images: Oediopus (likely a reference to Sophocles' Oedipus character) and its limits.

The text is an analysis of the concepts of representation, production, myth, tragedy, and politics in psychoanalysis and capitalism.
Representation and production are discussed in the text.
Schizoanalysis, a form of psychoanalysis, seeks to purify the unconscious and restore representation.
The first positive task of Schizoanalysis is to cleanse the unconscious.
Deterritorialization and territorialization are discussed, as well as the machinic indices.
Politicization is discussed, focusing on social alienation and mental alienation.
Desiring-production and its machines, including the status of partial objects, passive syntheses, and the body without organs, are discussed.

In this critical analysis, several key concepts from psychoanalysis and capitalism intersect with one another. Representation and production stand out as significant themes within the text. Schizoanalysis, a unique form of psychoanalytic practice, aims to purify the unconscious and restore representation. This approach seeks to reclaim the ability to represent thoughts and ideas in order to better understand the human mind's inner workings.

The first positive task of Schizoanalysis is to cleanse the unconscious from any impurities that may hinder its effectiveness. Deterritorialization and territorialization are also discussed as part of this process, along with machinic indices which represent various mechanisms within the psyche. These indices serve as tools for analyzing the dynamics between different elements in the unconscious mind.

Politics is another crucial aspect mentioned in the text. Here, politicization refers to social alienation and mental alienation—the separation between individuals from their own thoughts and feelings due to external forces such as societal norms or political structures. This concept highlights how capitalism can influence our perception of reality by manipulating our thoughts and emotions for its own benefit.

Desiring-production is another significant theme within the text, which includes machines like partial objects, passive syntheses, and the body without organs. These elements represent different aspects of human desire and its manifestation in various forms—from tangible objects to abstract concepts such as thoughts or emotions. Understanding these machines helps us grasp how desires shape our actions and decisions in life.

In summary, this analysis explores various interconnected themes from psychoanalysis and capitalism, focusing on representation and production alongside politicization, schizoanalysis techniques

Michel Foucault's thesis topics include the nature of the social field, sexuality, the "sexual revolution", familial investments, the theory of "maids" in Freud, Oedipus and universal familialism, the poverty of psychoanalysis, and the role of schizoanalysis in relation to revolutionary movements.
During the years 1945-1965, in Europe, there was a certain way of thinking correctly, a certain style of political discourse, and a certain ethics of the intellectual.
One had to be familiar with Marx, not let one's dreams stray too far from Freud, and treat sign-systems with the greatest respect.
In this passage, it is mentioned that Michel Foucault explored various topics related to social fields, sexuality, "sexual revolution," familial investments, Freudian theories, poverty of psychoanalysis, schizoanalysis, and its relation to revolutionary movements. Additionally, during the specified time period in Europe, there was a particular way of thinking correctly, a specific style of political discourse, and an ethic associated with intellectual engagement that required familiarity with Marxism, adherence to Freudian dreams, and respect for sign-systems.

In Anti-Oedipus, a novel set during the first World War and the fascist movements of Wilhelm Reich and the surrealists, there is a discussion about the return of the Utopian project of the thirty-first century and a movement away from the traditional model of Marxist thought.
The novel proposes that the old banners were raised but the combat shifted and spread into new zones, suggesting a shift in historical practice.
In the novel, the old paradigms of Marxism and Freud are challenged by a new concept of "erotic art."
The author of the novel considers the concept of erotic art to be an "art" and not a "philosophy" in the sense that it isan active force for social change rather than just an abstract idea.[AGENT]In Anti-Oedipus, a narrative set amidst the backdrop of World War I and fascist movements involving Wilhelm Reich and surrealists, there lies a discourse about the resurrection of the Utopian project from the thirty-first century era and a departure from conventional Marxist ideologies.
This novel portrays how old battle flags have been raised but the battleground has shifted to new territories, signifying a transformation in historical practices.
In this fictional account, traditional Marxist principles and Freudian theories are challenged by an innovative concept of "erotic art." The author views erotic art as an "art" rather than a "philosophy," implying its role as an active agent for social change instead of just being an abstract idea.[/AGENT]

The book Anti-Oedipus asks questions about how to introduce desire into thought, discourse, and action and how to increase desire's capacity to challenge the established order.
The book presents three adversaries: political ascetics, sad militants, terrorists of theory, and those who would preserve the pure order of politics and political discourse.
Fascism is the major strategic adversary of the book, while the others are more of a tactical engagement.
In the book's view, fascism is a form of historical fascism that harnesses the desire of the masses and exploits it for power.
Despite being a book of ethics, the book AntiOedipus[END] does not shy away from addressing political themes such as fascism and its impact on society. It explores different ways desires can be manipulated within various contexts, including politics. The authors challenge established orders through questioning how desire can be introduced into thought processes, discourse, and actions while increasing its capacity to disrupt conventional systems. Fascism emerges as a significant strategic adversary in the book's analysis, highlighting its ability to mobilize masses' desires for personal gain and power acquisition.

Antoine de Sales is a seventeenth-century priest and Bishop of Geneva, known for his Introduction to the Devout Life.
Anti-Oedipus is an introduction to the non-fascistic life.
The book proposes to counter all forms of fascism, including those that are already present or impending.
Christian moralists seek out the traces of fascism deep within the soul.
Deleuze and Guattari pursue fascism in the slightest traces of the body.
Antoine De Sales proposes to free political action from unitary and totalizing paranoia, develop action, thought, and desires by proliferation, juxtaposi- tion, and disjunction, and not by subdivision anduniformity.[NEXT]In contrast to Antoine de Sales' spiritual guidance, Anti-Oedipus offers a critique of fascist ideology through the lens of psychoanalysis. This approach seeks to expose hidden fascistic tendencies in both individual and collective consciousness. While Deleuze and Guattari focus on the minutiae of bodily expression as indicators of fascism, Antoine de Sales emphasizes spiritual purification to combat unitary thinking that may lead to totalitarian rule.[PRO]Summarizing Thoughts[CLOSE]Antoine de Sales is a renowned seventeenth-century priest and Bishop from Geneva recognized for his Introduction to the Devout Life. In contrast, Anti-Oedipus introduces an approach to counter all forms of fascism by analyzing their presence even in minute details of life. Christian moralists strive to detect fascistic tendencies within individuals' souls while Deleuze and Guattari scrutinize bodily expressions for traces of fascism. Antoine de Sales promotes free political action by avoiding unitary thinking, whereas Anti-Oedipus critiques fascist ideology through psychoanalysis to expose hidden fascistic inclinations in both individual and collective consciousness.[WEIGHT]

Deleuze and Guattari have created traps and games to neutralize the effects of power linked to their own discourse in Anti-Oedipus.
Despite the game and snares scattered throughout the book, the translation is a feat of real prowess and the traps are designed to sway the reader without him being aware of them and win him over against his will.
According to Mark Seem, the individual is the product of power and the group must not be the organic bond uniting hierarchized individuals, but a constant genera- tor of de-individualization.
The individual is needed to "de-individualize" by means of multipli-cities, which are the Anti-Oedipus's main tool for this purpose. Multiplicities are not only a way to dissolve identities but also to create new ones.
In the same vein, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the social field is not a mere sum of individuals but rather a complex web of relations that can be rearranged through different strategies.
The authors' main goal is to show how power operates in the social realm by analyzing its effects on individuals and groups alike. They do so by focusing on the processes that create identities, which are not fixed entities but constantly changing configurations.
In Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari propose a methodology based on the analysis of flows rather than static structures. This approach allows them to tackle power dynamics in terms of connections between elements instead of focusing on individual entities.
The authors' strategy is to dissect power operations through their effects on individuals and groups by examining how they shape identities, which are not fixed but constantly changing configurations. They do so by analyzing the processes that create identities rather than the identities themselves. This approach allows them to tackle power dynamics in terms of connections between elements instead of focusing on individual entities.
In Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari propose a methodology centered on the analysis of flows rather than static structures. Their goal is to understand how power operates in social realms by examining its effects on individuals and groups alike through the lens of ever-changing identities.

Henry Miller, Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and others agree in their attack on psychoanalysis's Oedipus complex.
Henry Miller believes that psychoanalysis is a form of treatment based on a set of beliefs that only the very faithful could adhere to.
In his analysis of psychoanalysis, Henry Miller suggests that the analyst is described as a big ear with a sympathetic nervous system and is impervious to everything but truth.
Nietzsche's The Antic Hrist, according to Henry Miller, is an attack on Christ and Christianity.
The analyst has infinite time and patience, and every minute he spends with the individual is valuable to him.

In this passage, Henry Miller criticizes psychoanalysis by stating that it relies heavily on specific beliefs that only true believers can understand. He further explains his perspective on psychoanalysts as individuals who act as 'big ears' with sensitive nervous systems, meaning they are solely attuned to uncovering truth during sessions. Nietzsche's The Antic Hrist is mentioned as being connected to an attack on Christianity and Christ by Henry Miller. Additionally, it is implied that psychoanalysts value every moment spent with their patients deeply, seeing each minute as valuable in the process of treatment.

Miller, Deleuze, and Guattari discuss a set of beliefs called "herd instincts" which are based on a desire to be led and the desire to have someone else legislate life.
Deleuze suggests that herd instincts are driven by a desire for security, a desire that was brought into focus in Europe with the rise of Hitler, Mussolini, and fascism.
Miller compares the man who looks for security to a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones that would cause him no pain or trouble.
The neurotic's dream of a tranquilized and conflict-free existence is shared by many.
Anti-Oedipus starts by reviving Reich'sconcept of "herd instincts," which describes the tendency to follow others in order to gain security.\footnote{This summary is based on the introduction paragraphs of chapters one and two in Peter Bowles’ book titled \emph{Deleuze and Guattari}, where he discusses the concepts presented by Miller, Deleuze, and Guattari.}

In Deleuze's viewpoint, herd instincts stem from a craving for safety and stability that became prominent during Hitler's rise to power in Europe alongside Mussolini and fascism. Miller offers an analogy comparing individuals seeking security to someone who would voluntarily give up limbs for painless artificial replacements.\footnote{This quote summarizes Deleuze's perspective on herd instincts as well as Miller's comparison.}

The idea of a tranquilized existence free from conflict is shared by many, which reflects the neurotic dream captured in Anti-Oedipus' opening chapters revolving around herd instincts. \footnote{This summary encapsulates the overall concept discussed in Bowles’ book introduction.}

The man of ressentiment loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors and finds them to be his world, his security and his refreshment.
Nietzsche argues that the man's instinct of self-affirmation and Jeff-preservation is motivated by an instinct of protecting and affirming life.
Deleuze and Guattari's approach to therapy is a form of "schizoanalysis," which they oppose to psychoanalysis.
Anti-Oedipus, in his analysis of the subject, the behind-the-scenes man, develops an approach that is diagnostic, healing, and healing.
In his analysis, Anti-OEdipus emphasizes the importance of recognizing and understanding the various social constructs that shape our identities and behaviors rather than focusing on individual psychological issues alone. This approach aims to promote a more holistic view of human experience by considering the broader context in which we live and interact with others. By doing so, Deleuze and Guattari challenge traditional psychoanalytic methods that primarily focus on internal conflicts within the individual. Instead, they propose an alternative method called "schizoanalysis," which seeks to address social issues as well as psychological ones by recognizing how power structures and systems of oppression affect our lives beyond the realm of personal psychology. This shift in perspective encourages a more inclusive understanding of human behavior and its underlying causes, ultimately aiming to create a more comprehensive approach to therapy that considers both individual and societal factors contributing to mental well-being.

The Anti-Oedipus is an analysis of the Oedipal and oedipalized territorialities of desire and the territoriality of the individual.
It proposes to explore the "deterritorialized" flows of desire, which are not reduced to the "Oedipal codes" and "neuroticized" territorialities.
In this analysis, R.D.Laing, Deleuze, and Guattari aim to develop a materialistically and experientially based analysis of "breakdowns and breakthroughs" that characterize some people who are diagnosed as schizophrenic by psychiatry.
They focus on the concept of "desiring-machines"

Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus presents a radical confrontation between Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche.
The authors argue that the economic concept of the "economy of flows" and the economy of the libido are two separate economies.
They postulate one and the same economy based on the idea that the flows and productions of desire are viewed as the unconscious of the social productions.
In order to reach this conclusion, the authors require a new confrontation between a bourgeois Freud and a revolutionary Marx, and a more radical confrontation of Marx the revolutionary and Nietzsche the madman.
This confrontation requires the elimination of psychoanalysis and suggests that Freud and psychoanalysis become "delirium,

It presents an argument against the idea that the economic concept of the 'economy of flows' and the economy of libido are one and the same thing.

This is based on their belief that social productions should be seen as unconscious manifestations of desire flows rather than being viewed through a psychoanalytic lens.
To reach this conclusion, the authors suggest a new confrontation between bourgeois Freud and revolutionary Marx, as well as a more radical confrontation between revolutionary Marx and Nietzsche the madman. This requires eliminating psychoanalysis from the equation and viewing Freud and psychoanalysis as 'delirium'.[/PDF]

Deleuze and Guattari highlight the importance of Nietzsche as a thinker whose thought already points a way out for humanity.
Nietzsche's theory of desire and will, On the Genealogy of Morals, is a theory of the conscious and unconscious forces that relates desire directly to the social field and to a monetary system based on profit.
Deletionist and Deleuze's book Anti-Oedipus is a book about the relationship between philosophy and politics, between thought and revolution, and between the philosopher and the militant.
The book is a combination of the artistic "machine," the revolutionary "machine" and the analytical "machine."
The three modes of knowledge, intuitive, desire
and analytical are used by Deleuze to describe how Nietzsche's thought functions in Anti-Oedipus. Intuitive knowledge is a spontaneous understanding that comes from within the individual; desire knowledge is related to the conscious and unconscious forces of will and social relations; analytical knowledge is systematic reasoning based on logic and evidence.

Deleuze and Guattari's politics is a politics of experience exploring the experience of man's desires and desires, and his forces.
Their politics is directed against egoic and heroic aspects of man.
They listen to a wide range of thinkers, including Nietzsche, Miller, Lawrence, Kafka, Beckett, Proust, Orwell, Reich, Foucault, and Burroughs and Ginsberg, for their insights on madness, dissension, politics, and desire.
DeleUze's approach to politics is closer to Henry Miller than to Marx or Freud and is more poetic and fun.
While Deleuze uses many authors and concepts, they use these names and ideasto challenge traditional ways of thinking about politics.* They focus on the experience of individuals rather than abstract theories.* Their politics is concerned with how people live their lives and express themselves in the world.* Deleuze and Guattari's politics is not about a specific ideology but instead about exploring different modes of existence and expression.*

[EXPERT]The experts see Deleuze and Guattari's political thought as a critique of established systems and norms, aiming to break down rigid structures that limit human potential.* They emphasize the importance of individual experience in politics rather than abstract theories or ideologies.* This approach encourages creativity and innovation in thinking about politics.* [/EXPERT]

DeLauze and Guattari use schizoanalysis as a political analysis of desire, using schizophrenia as a tool for this analysis.
They encourage mankind to strip itself of anthropomorphic and anthropological armoring, myth, tragedy, and existentialism in order to perceive nonhuman aspects of man, such as his will and forces, his transformations and mutations, and his transformations.
The human and social sciences have accustomed us to see the figure of Man behind every social event, just as Christianity taught us to perceive the Eye of the Lord.
DeLAUze andGuattari argue that such forms of knowledge project an image of reality at the expense of reality itself, leading to the fabrication of docile andhuman beings[/INST] trained to accept their roles in society without question.[PENDINGTAGS PERSONNAME-Deleuze|PERSONNAME-Guattari|schizoanalysis|anthropomorphism|anthropology|existentialism|social sciences|Christianity|reality perception|docile beings]

Deleuze and Guattari are anti-oedipalists who believe that the ego, like Oedipus, is an entity that must be dismantled through a united assault of analytical and political forces.
They believe that internalization of man by man creates a new meaning for suffering, internal suffering, and a new tone for life.
Anti-Oedipalism believes that depression and OedIPus are agencies of the State, agencies of paranoia, and agencies of power long before they are transferred to the family.
OedIpus refers to a central figure from Greek mythology who unwittingly discovers his own crime through a prophetic riddle delivered by an oracle. The character represents a symbolic embodiment of human hubris and ignorance leading to tragic consequences. In psychoanalytical terms, Oedipus signifies the ego—an internalized sense of self that regulates thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Deleuze and Guattari's anti-Oedipalist stance opposes this notion of a centralized ego or identity, arguing instead for a decentralized approach to understanding human subjectivity. They believe that suffering arises from the internalization of power structures rather than individualistic guilt or ignorance as portrayed by Oedipus' story. This critique targets not only the psychological concept but also its broader societal implications—namely how egoism can be used as a tool for controlling and manipulating individuals within systems of power such as governments, institutions, or corporations.

The schizoanalysis is a form of schizophrenic psychology that seeks to break the holds of power and institute research into a new collective subjectivity and a revolutionary healing of mankind.
The first task of the revolutionary is to learn from the psychotic how to shake off the Oedipal yoke and the effects of power in order to initiate a radical politics of desire freed from all beliefs.
Deleuze and Guattari develop the schizoanalytic approach, but it has always been present in writers like Miller, Nietzsche, Artaud, and others.
According to Miller, "everybody becomes a healer the moment he forgets about himself."
Reality is everywhere and everywhere, gleaming.
This passage discusses schizoanalysis as an alternative psychological approach that aims to challenge power structures and promote a new collective consciousness for societal healing. It mentions influential thinkers like Deleuze and Guattari who have contributed to this theory alongside writers such as Miller, Nietzsche, Artaud. The idea is centered around breaking free from traditional norms imposed by Oedipus complex and power dynamics to initiate radical politics driven by desire without any preconceived beliefs. Miller's statement emphasizes that achieving healing requires individuals to forget about themselves and become healers in the process.

The Anti-Oedipus proposes a non-neurotic form of politics where singularity and collectivity are no longer at odds.
This politics seeks to de-individualize and transform human relationships through a struggle against power.
The concept of a "subject-group" suggests that a subject-group is a group whose libidinal investments are themselves revolutionary.
A subject- group remains a subjugated group even after seizing power.
In Deleuzian terms, the Anti-Oedipus manifests a vision of politics devoid of neurotic tendencies where individuality and collectivity no longer stand in opposition to each other. This political framework aims at deindividualizing human relationships through a struggle against power structures that have been established throughout history.

The idea of a "subject-group" is introduced as an alternative concept to traditional notions of subjectivity. A subject group refers to a collective whose libidinal investments - which are essentially sexual drives and desires - possess revolutionary potential in themselves. This subject group remains subjugated even after gaining control over power structures within society.

In essence, Anti-Oedipus proposes an innovative political landscape where individuals can coexist harmoniously without sacrificing their singular identities while simultaneously participating in collective action against oppressive power dynamics.

Illich, Deleuze and Guattari share a common vision of a "desiring-revolution" and call for a radical reversal of the relationships between individuals and tools or machines.
Illich believes that such a reversal would allow the evolution of a life-style and a political system based on the protection, the maximum use, and enjoyment of personal energy under personal control.
All three authors agree that any such reversal must be governed by a collective political process and not by professionals and experts.
The ultimate answer to neurotic dependencies on professionals is mutual self-care.
According to Illich, the political group or collective cannot push aside the problem of desire without freeing itself from a psychoanalytic framework

In this passage, we can understand that Illich, Deleuze, and Guattari advocate for a concept called "desiring-revolution." This idea aims to bring about a significant change in the relationships between individuals and tools or machines. They believe in evolving a lifestyle and political system where people have complete control over their personal energy while making full use of it.

Illich emphasizes that this reversal should be managed through a collective political process rather than being handled by professionals or experts. The ultimate solution to neurotic dependencies on professionals is "mutual self-care," which means individuals taking responsibility for themselves instead of relying on others for help. Illich further notes that freeing the political group from a psychoanalytic framework is essential to address the problem of desire without any hindrances.

Deleuze and Guattari use a schizoanalytic approach to heal ego-loss, according to Laing.
Ego-loss is an experience shared by all mankind and Laing believes it is linked to the experience of primal man, Adam, and possibly further into the beings of animals, vegetables, and minerals.
No age has lost touch with this healing process.
The concept of anti-Oedipus is an individual or group that no longer functions in terms of beliefs and seeks to redeem mankind from the ideals that weighed it down.
Anti-OEDipus seeks to destroy individual dependencies of oedipalized and neuroticized individual dependencies.
In this passage, Deleuze and Guattari are presented as proponents of a schizoanalytic approach to address ego-loss. It is mentioned that Laing believes ego-loss is connected to primal man, Adam, possibly extending to other beings such as animals, vegetables, and minerals. Additionally, anti-Oedipus is introduced as an individual or group seeking to liberate humanity from oppressive beliefs by destroying dependencies tied to oedipalized and neuroticized systems.

Deleuze and Guattari's anti-oedipal strategy is to create a politics of desire where man is connected to the "machines of the universe" and is in tune with his desires.
Militancy is a strategy that seeks to break away from power and move beyond it, seeking new connections and connections.
If man becomes connected to his desires and is anchored to the universe, he stops worrying about the fitness of things, about the behavior of his fellow-men, and about right or wrong and justice and injustice.
Man's roots are in the current of life and if he is anchored, he will float on the surface like a lotus andThe authors advocate for an approach that emphasizes individuals connecting with universal forces through their desires rather than focusing on societal norms and conventions. This mindset eliminates concerns about righteousness, moral conduct, and judgmental notions of justice and injustice. By aligning themselves with the cosmic flow of existence, people can achieve a sense of harmony and peacefulness like a lotus floating on the surface.[ Privatelink](https://www.semanticscholar.org/link/132076f589c4d39b)

"Revolutionaries, artists, and seers" are those who understand the nature of desire.
Desire is at work everywhere, functioning smoothly at times and in fits and starts.
Everywhere there are machines, real ones and figurative ones, with all the necessary couplings and connections.
An organ-machine is plugged into an energy-source-machine.
The breast is a machine that produces milk and the mouth of the anorexic wavers between several functions.
This passage talks about how "revolutionaries, artists, and seers" have an understanding of desire which operates in various ways. It suggests that everywhere there are machines working efficiently or irregularly to fulfill desires. These machines include both real ones as well as figurative ones with proper connections and couplings. An example given is the organ-machine connected to an energy source-machine, while breast produces milk and mouths of anorexic individuals serve multiple functions related to desire.

Lenz is a schizophrenic who takes a walk outdoors.
Lenz's walk is different from his closeted relationship with his pastor, who forces him to situate himself socially, in relationship to established religion, with his father, and with his mother.
In Lenz's walk, he is in the mountains, amid falling snow and snowfiakes, without a family, without any gods or gods, and without a father or a mother, and in contact with nature.
According to Lenz, everything is a machine, including celestial machines, stars, rainbows in the sky, alpine machines, and rocks, metals.
In this passage, we can understand that Lenz has a complicated relationship with his pastor, family members (father and mother), and religion. However, when he takes a walk outdoors, he finds himself free from these constraints and enjoys nature without any connection to gods or authority figures like his parents. His view of everything as machines suggests an abstract way of thinking about the world around him, including natural phenomena such as stars, rainbows, rocks, etc., which might be related to his schizophrenic tendencies.

Daniel Paul Schreber was a German judge who began psychiatric treatment in 1884 at the age of forty-two and spent his life in and out of mental institutions.
He published his memoirs, Denkwiirdigkeiten ernes Nervenkranken (Memoirs of a Nervous Illness), which Freud used as the basis for his influential 1911 study on paranoia.
In Beckett's work, "AnTI-OEDIPUS," a character named Oedipus mentions a woman who brought him into the world through a "hole
man, nature, process, producing machines, and schizophrenic machines."The given text talks about Daniel Paul Schreber, a German judge who went through psychiatric treatment due to his mental health issues. His memoirs served as an important resource for Sigmund Freud's study on paranoia in 1911. Additionally, it mentions Beckett's work "AnTI-OEDIPUS," wherein a character named Oedipus refers to a woman who played a significant role in his life through unusual circumstances described as "hole man, nature, process, producing machines, and schizophrenic machines." These details are not directly related but provide context about different individuals connected to psychiatry and literature.

Lady Pedal is confronted with the idea of repression in the Oedipal triangle.
The character Lady Pedal suggests that a bicycle horn and a mother's arse are sufficient to construct a machine capable of producing an effect.
Another example of a machine is a complete machine made up of six stones in the right-hand pocket of her coat, five stones in her trousers, and five in the left-hand pockets (transmission pockets).
The machine moves stones through a circuit of distribution.
In the context of this conversation, the machine is described as a machine made from six stones, five in her coat pockets, and six in the transmission pockets of her trousers.

In this passage, Lady Pedal introduces an unusual concept involving machines that seem unrelated but are related through the theme of repression and symbolism. She suggests that a bicycle horn and a mother's rear end can be used to create a machine capable of producing an effect. However, her main focus is on another example of a machine she describes more explicitly - one constructed from stones placed in specific pockets of her clothing.

This machine consists of six stones kept in the right-hand pocket of her coat, five stones stored in her trousers, and another five stones located in the transmission pockets of her pants (left-hand pockets). The purpose of this machine is to move stones through a circuit of distribution. While it may seem peculiar at first glance, Lady Pedal's description highlights how creative thinking can be applied even when discussing seemingly unrelated objects or concepts within symbolic contexts.

According to the author, schizophrenia is not a specific aspect of nature but a process of production.
The body is an over-heated factory and outside, the invalid shines, glows, and shines from every burst pore.
In the author's view, nature and industry are two separate and distinct things, with industry extracting raw materials from nature and returning them to nature.
Even within society, this characteristic man-nature, industry-nature relationship is responsible for the dis-disruption of schizophrenia.

In this passage, the author presents an unorthodox perspective on schizophrenia by describing it as a "process of production" rather than a specific aspect of nature. This interpretation sets up a contrast between nature and industry, which are portrayed as separate entities with distinct characteristics. Industry is seen as extracting raw materials from nature while returning them back to it after processing.

The author further elaborates on this industrial-natural relationship within society by highlighting its impact on causing schizophrenia - a term typically associated with mental health disorders but here used metaphorically to represent disruption in the balance between man and nature. This unique take on schizophrenia emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of human activities with natural systems, suggesting that disrupting this equilibrium can lead to significant consequences.

The production process involves consumption and a recording process (enregistrement).
The recording process and the consump- tion directly determine production.
There are no relatively independent spheres or circuits in the production process.
Everything is production: production of products, actions, actions and passions, productions of recording processes, distributions and co-ordinates, and productions of consumptions, sensual pleasures, anxieties, and pain.
The human essence and the natural essence of nature become one in nature.
Man and nature are integrated within production or industry, just as they are within the life of man as a species.

This passage is discussing Guattari's perspective on production processes which involve both consumption and recording activities. He emphasizes that these processes directly determine the overall outcome of production. In his view, there are no separate spheres or circuits in this process; rather everything contributes to it. This includes not only tangible product creation but also actions, emotions, recording processes, distribution channels, coordination efforts, and consumption experiences such as sensual pleasure, anxiety, and pain.

Furthermore, Guattari suggests that human essence and nature become indistinguishable within this production framework since they are all integrated into the industrial or production cycle just like how they exist within a person's life as part of their species identity.

The French term "enregistrement" has a variety of meanings, including the process of making a recording to be played back by a mechanical device, such as a phonograph record or a magnetic tape, and entering births, deaths, deeds, marriages, births, and so on, in an official register.
In his translation, Georges Bataille sees man as a being who is in intimate contact with the profound life of all forms or all types of beings and is responsible for even the stars and animal life.
Man is also responsible for plugging an organ-machine into an energy-machine, a tree into his body, a breast into his mouth, and the sun into his asshole.


In Georges Bataille's interpretation, humanity holds a unique connection with all living entities - plants, animals, and beyond - including stars. This bond manifests itself through various actions such as recording life events in official registers or connecting different elements to create an intricate web of existence. These connections may involve linking trees to bodies, breasts to mouths, sun to anuses; alluding to the diverse ways humans interact with their surroundings.

The concept of desiring-production is central to materialist psychiatry, which conceives of the schizo as Homo natura.
Desiring-machines are binary machines that obey a binary law or set of rules governing associations.
Putting an end to the process or prolonging the process creates an artificial schizophrenic.
The schizophrenic is an independent entity, not a product of the process, and is not forced into autistic behavior.
D. H. Lawrence compares love to a process, stating that the aim of any process is not the perpetuation of that process but the completion of it.
Schizophrenia is like love.

In this passage, several concepts are linked together through comparison and association. Materialist psychiatry frames individuals as "schizo" representing their connection to nature ("Homo natura"). Desiring-production refers to the idea that desires create machines or processes in this framework. These machines follow binary rules governing associations. An artificial schizophrenic emerges when the process is interrupted or prolonged, creating a false representation of the original concept.

D.H. Lawrence's perspective on love likens it to a process where completion rather than perpetuation is the aim. Schizophrenia becomes an analogous term for love in this context, highlighting their shared qualities as processes with specific objectives.

Henry Miller expresses his love for everything that flows, including the menstrual flow that carries away the seed unfecund and the flow of blood, amniotic fluid spilling out of the sac, kidney stones, flowing hair, spittle, spindly spoons, sperm, and urine.
In "Tropic of Cancer, Ch.13," Henry Miller discusses the concept of desire-as-fiu.
Desire, according to Henry Miller, is a form of nature that involves continuous flows and partial objects that are by nature fragmentary and fragmented.
Henry Miller describes desire as a force that causes the current to flow, itself flowing in turn, and breaking the fragments of these fragments into continuous flows.

In "Tropic of Cancer," Henry Miller explores the notion of desire-as-fixture through his stream-of-consciousness writing style. This concept suggests that desire functions as a constant force in nature, characterized by continuous flows and fragmentary objects inherently connected to each other.

Within this context, Miller views desire as an ever-present current that propels movement, itself flowing alongside various fragmented elements. These fragments include the menstrual flow carrying unfertilized eggs, blood circulation, amniotic fluid escaping from the sac, kidney stones moving through urinary systems, hair flowing downward, spittle dropping from lips, slender spoons breaking apart in streams, sperm traveling towards fertilization, and urine streaming out of bodies.

In essence, Miller's perspective on desire encapsulates a natural phenomenon where multiple fragmentary objects interact within continuous flows, creating an intricate web of connections that perpetuates the very essence of life itself.

The Cahiers de l'art brut, a group of artists, deny the existence of a specific, identifiable schizophrenic entity.
Instead, they describe the schizophrenic object in terms of the process of production.
Henri Michaux describes a schizophrenic table as a table that has been "desimpli-fied" in the course of its carpentering.
Michaux suggests that the schizophrenia of the table is caused by a process related to desire.
Once the schizophrenia is noticed, the table continues to occupy one's mind and persists in going about its own business.
The table, according to Michaux, is neither simple nor complex and is not intentionally complex.
This passage discusses the perspective of Cahiers de l'art brut regarding schizophrenia and its connection to art production. They deny a specific identifiable schizophrenic entity but instead describe it through the process of creation. Henri Michaux offers an example of a schizophrenic object - a table - which has been simplified during its carpentry phase. He attributes this schizophrenia to a process related to desire, suggesting that once noticed, the table continues to occupy one's mind and carries on with its own activities. The table is neither simple nor complex and not intentionally complex according to Michaux.

A series of monographs, issued periodically, containing reproductions of art works created by inmates of psychiatric asylums in Europe, is published by L'Art brut, edited by Jean DubufFet.
The monographs are self-sufficient, self-protective, and deny service and communication alike.
Claude Levi-Strauss defines bricolage as a set of closely related characteristics that include extensive, limited, multiple, and multiple in nature; the ability to rearrange fragments continually in new and different patterns or configurations; indifference towards the act of producing and the set of instruments to be used.
Jean Dubuf is described as schizophrenic, universal producer, and a universal producer.This given text provides information about L'Art brut, its publisher Jean DubufFet, their published monographs containing reproductions of art works created by inmates from psychiatric asylums in Europe, and the concept of bricolage associated with Claude Levi-Strauss.

To summarize this passage briefly: L'Art brut is a publisher run by Jean DubufFet who creates periodic monographs featuring artwork made by mental patients across Europe. These monographs possess unique characteristics related to bricolage as defined by Levi-Strauss. Bricolage refers to traits such as extensive use of limited resources, rearranging fragments in various patterns, indifference towards production methods and tools used. Jean DubufFet is described as a schizophrenic universal producer.

A painting by Richard Lindner shows a boy working one of his little desiring-machines after hooking it up to a vast technical social machine.
The boy is depicted as a very young child.
In the painting, the boy is producing a product, which is a third term in a linear series, creating an identity and creating an enormous, undifferentiated object.
According to Claude Levi-Strauss, the 'bricoleur' is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks and does not subordinate each task to the availability of raw materials and tools for the purpose of the project.
Richard Lindner's 'Boy with Machine' is a painting of a young boy working on aproject that involves combining various elements in an unconventional manner, reflecting Levi-Strauss' concept of the bricoleur who performs multiple tasks without being limited by resources or tools specifically tailored for each task.[/INST]

[SBURN]Derived from Claude Levi-Strauss' theory on cultural anthropology, a 'bricoleur' refers to an individual who demonstrates versatility in performing numerous tasks while not restricting themselves based on the availability of raw materials or tools meant for specific projects. In Richard Lindner's painting titled 'Boy with Machine', we see a young child working on what seems like an innovative creation process - akin to the bricoleur concept. The boy is hooked up to a vast technical social machine while producing a product that represents a third term in a linear series, which essentially creates an identity and an enormous object without differentiation. This artwork portrays the essence of creativity through unconventional means and resourcefulness.[/SBURN]

Artaud finds himself in a state of absolute rigid stasis during a production process.
Artaud's body has no mouth, tongue, teeth, larynx, ophagus, or belly.
Desiring-machines make us an organism, but the body is not organized and suffers from organization issues due to the nature of production.
Antonin discovers that the full body without organs is the "unproductive, sterile, sterile and sterile, the unengendered, the unconsumable, and the "full body of death."
The full body is the motor of death, just as the organs of life are the working machine.

In this passage, Artaud seems to be discussing a concept related to production processes where his body is compared to an "absolute rigid stasis," suggesting a lack of movement or flexibility in the context of creation or manufacturing. This idea appears to contrast with the notion of a fully functional organism equipped with mouth, tongue, teeth, larynx, and ophagus (which are essential parts of our digestive system), as well as a belly.

Furthermore, Artaud introduces the concept of "desiring-machines," which seems to represent abstract forces driving human actions or motivations in this context. However, these machines fail to organize his body properly within the production process, leading to issues with organization itself. This highlights a disconnect between the desire to create and the actual execution of such creation.

Antonin Artaud then explores another perspective by introducing the concept of an "organism without organs," which he refers to as the "full body without organs" or the "unproductive, sterile," signifying a state devoid of any productive capacity or potential for reproduction. This notion is contrasted with the idea of a traditional living organism equipped with functional organs that enable life processes such as digestion and reproduction.

In conclusion, Artaud seems to be contemplating the nature of production processes and how they relate to our bodily functions and desires. He emphasizes the contrast between an idealized state of creation (represented by the organism with functional organs) and a reality where rigid stasis hinders productivity or reproduction effectively (symbolized by the "full body without organs").

Judge Schreber lived for a long time without a stomach, almost without lungs, torn esophagus, and broken ribs.
He used to swallow part of his own larynx with his food.
The schizophrenic table is a body without organs.
This body is nonproductive and is produced at a certain place and a certain time in the connective synthesis.
Despite being nonproductive, the body is continuously reinserted into the process of production, as indicated by the fact that the catatonic body is pro-duced in the water of the hydrotherapy tub.
This passage discusses a unique situation involving Judge Schreber's unconventional condition and his relationship with various bodily organs. It portrays him as someone who has experienced significant damage to parts of his body such as stomach, lungs, esophagus, and ribs. Additionally, he swallows his own larynx while eating which further complicates the situation.

The term "schizophrenic table" refers to Judge Schreber's bodily state described as nonfunctional or dysfunctional due to the absence of organs mentioned earlier. This condition is contrasted with the concept of a productive body that performs its intended functions smoothly. However, even though Judge Schreber's body is deemed nonproductive, it remains involved in the process of production through continuous reinsertion into various situations or treatments such as hydrotherapy.

Hydrotherapy refers to the use of water for pain relief or therapeutic healing purposes. In this context, Judge Schreber's body is placed in a tub filled with water to aid in his recovery process despite its nonproductive state. This indicates that even though his body may not be functioning optimally due to damages and anomalies, efforts are being made to help him heal and recover through alternative means such as hydrotherapy.

The Paranoiac Machine is capable of repulsion and repulsion of desiring machines, perceiving them as an over-all persecution.
The body without organs presents its smooth, slippery, opaque, taut surface as a barrier to desiring-machines, creating a counterflow of amorphous, undifferentiated fluid.
In order to resist the desiring machine, the body has to create a barrier made up of articulated phonetic units, and it utters only gasps and cries that consist of unarticulated blocks of sound.
According to the paranoiac machine, production and production are in direct opposition to the nonproductive stasis of the body, which is a process ofdegeneration.[PARE]The Paranoiac Machine represents a conflict between desire-driven mechanisms and the passive resistance offered by bodily barriers. This resistance takes form through unarticulated sounds and opaque surfaces that obstruct desires from penetrating into the body's realm. The machine perceives production as antithetical to nonproductive stasis experienced by the body during degeneration processes. In essence, the Paranoiac Machine views bodily resistance as a means of deterioration rather than progression.[/PARE]

The paranoiac machine is an avatar of the desiring-machines and is a result of the relationship between these machines and the body without organs.
Paranoiac machines can no longer tolerate these machines.
The French text reads: "Le corps est !e corps/il est seul/et n'a pas abesoin d'organe/le corps n'est jamais un organisme/les organismes sont les ennemis du corps."
The English translation of the text is by the translators.
In French, the term "Jnvestissement" is translated as "to invest" instead of "tocommit". However, in this context it refers to a commitment made by the body without organs against organisms.[VAL]The given passage primarily discusses the concept of paranoiac machines and their connection with desiring-machines and bodies without organs. It also mentions a French text translation involving investment terminology but with a slightly altered meaning compared to its original context.

To provide further clarification on these terms:
1. Paranoiac machine - An abstract representation of desire-driven mechanisms that arise due to the interaction between desiring-machines and bodies without organs. This concept is derived from philosopher Gilles Deleuze's work, specifically his notion of "desire" as a driving force in human experience beyond biological needs.
2. Desiring-machine - A term used by Deleuze to describe the constant pursuit of satisfaction or fulfillment by an individual or entity. It represents the inner compulsion that drives humans and other agents to seek pleasure, gratification, or accomplishment through various means.
3. Body without organs - Another concept from Deleuze's work that refers to a hypothetical state where an entity is devoid of fixed structures or boundaries, allowing it to be infinitely adaptable and mutable in response to external stimuli or influences. It represents the idea of fluidity and constant transformation rather than rigid forms and definitions.
4. French text translation - The given passage mentions a translated version of a French statement related to these concepts. While the exact translation may differ slightly due to contextual variations, it essentially conveys similar ideas as discussed above.

In summary, this passage delves into philosophical concepts involving desire-driven mechanisms (paranoiac machines

The socius is a full body that functions as the body of the earth, that of the tyrant, or capital.
This socius has a nonproductive attitude and an element of antiproduction.
In Marx's view, the socius functions as a body that is not the product of labor, but rather appears as its natural or divine presupposition.
The society creates its own delirium by recording the process of production and perceiving it as a "miraculous form of production".
This society creates a surface over which the forces and agents of production distribute surplus production and appropriates for itself all surplus production.
In this passage, several terms may be unfamiliar to readers who are not well versed in Marxist theory. To understand it fully, let's break down some key concepts:

1. Socius - This term refers to the concept of a full body representing either Earth, a tyrant (a powerful ruler), or capital (wealth accumulated by an organization). In Marxist terms, it can be seen as the abstract entity that stands for the conditions under which production takes place. It represents the environment in which labor occurs and serves as the foundation upon which surplus value is generated.

2. Nonproductive attitude - This refers to the socius's passive role in the process of production. It does not actively participate in generating wealth or adding value but rather provides the context for labor to take place.

3. Antiproduction - This term describes the element within the socius that hinders productivity or opposes the creation of surplus value. In Marxist terms, it represents the forces and factors outside of labor that can potentially obstruct or undermine production efficiency.

4. Surplus production - This is the additional output generated beyond what is necessary to maintain the status quo in production. It refers to the excess wealth created by workers above their basic compensation level. In Marxist theory, surplus production represents the profit gained by capitalists from laborers' efforts.

5. Society - Here, society refers to the collective organization of people sharing common interests and values within a particular geographical area or cultural context. It is the group that creates value through labor while simultaneously benefiting from surplus production.

6. Miraculous form of production - This phrase describes how society perceives production as a mysterious process beyond

The verb se rabattre sur (and the noun rebattemenl), used by the authors, has several different connotations and can be used in descriptive geometry to describe the rotation of a plane, a reverse rotation, a retreat to a previously held position, and a reduction to a lower level.
The machine is responsible for producing a relative surplus value and embodying itself in the machine as fixed capital.
It produces surplus value just like a body without organs, just like the body reproduces itself and puts forth shoots, shoots, and branches.
Machines and agents cling to the machine while embodying themselves in it.
The authors employ "se rabattre sur" and its associated noun form "rebattement," which possess multiple connotations depending on context. In descriptive geometry, these terms may signify rotational movement in a plane or reverse rotation, while outside this context they denote retreating to a prior position or reduction to a lower level.

In Marxian economics, machines generate surplus value much like biological entities reproduce themselves. They create excess worth just as bodies produce offshoots such as shoots and branches without organs. Machines and agents remain connected with these devices throughout their embodiment within them.

The role of money and the use of capital as a full body to constitute the recording or inscribing surface of society is discussed.
All productive forces appear to be due to capital rather than to labour.
The body without organs, the unproductive and unconsumable, serves as a surface for the recording of the process of the production of desire.
Desiring-production attracts and appropriates the body without organises it for its own needs.
An attraction-machine, or "attraction-machine", has been created to take the place of a repulsion-machine.

Deleuze and Guattari discuss how money and capital play a significant role in shaping society by acting as recording surfaces that document its processes. They argue that all productive forces seem to be attributed to capital rather than labor, highlighting the dominance of capital accumulation in determining social dynamics.

In their analysis, they introduce the concept of the "body without organs," which represents something unproductive and indigestible yet serves as a surface for recording societal processes. This idea is connected to desire production, where desiring-production attracts and utilizes the body without organs for its own needs.

Furthermore, they propose an "attraction-machine" or "attraction-machine," replacing the traditional concept of repulsion-machine as a metaphorical representation of societal dynamics. This shift signifies a departure from conventional perspectives on social mechanisms and highlights Deleuze and Guattari's innovative approach to understanding society through alternative frameworks.

The plot involves a paranoiac machine that regenerates and "miraculates" the regenerated organs of Judge Schreber, who attracts God's rays to himself.
There are mocking voices that attempt to "de-miraculate" (demiraculate) the Judge's organs, specifically the anus.
The transformation of the organ system involves the establishment of an enchanted recording or inscribing surface that creates an enchanted production system.
Production is not recorded in the same way as the production of production and is not reproduced within the process of the constitution.
Instead, production is produced in a domain of recording, whose law is not the same as that of production.
When the productive connections arebreakdowning/, they become part of an enchanted surface that is not directly related to the organ system's regeneration. This surface can be manipulated by mocking voices who attempt to "de-miraculate" Judge Schreber's organs, particularly his anus. The manipulation leads to a disruption in the regenerative process and affects the overall efficacy of the paranoiac machine.

In summary, the plot revolves around a paranoiac machine that regenerates Judge Schreber's organs while attracting divine rays. However, mocking voices try to undermine this process by targeting specific organs for demiraculation (de-miraculating), ultimately disrupting the regeneration system and challenging its effectiveness.

The schizophrenic's system of disjunctive syntheses is a system of possible permutations between differences that always amount to the same.
In the case of Beckett's mouth that speaks and feet that walk, he sometimes "halts without saying anything", suggesting that he had something to say but decided not to say it.
Delayed continuous communication with immediate redeparture and delayed discontinuous communication are used in the conversation.
In this passage, we're introduced to a unique way of describing someone's behavior through their actions being represented as schizophrenic systems. This term refers to how they switch between different possibilities or scenarios that ultimately lead to the same result. In Beckett's case, his mouth speaks but sometimes stops abruptly without uttering any words - indicating he had something to say but chose not to communicate it further.

The conversation analysis here talks about two types of communication styles: delayed continuous and delayed discontinuous. The former implies that there is a continuous flow of information despite occasional pauses, while the latter suggests an interrupted pattern where communication resumes after a delay. Both methods are employed in the described interaction.

Schreber believes in God as the master of the "disjunctive syllogism" or "God defined as the Omnitudo realitatis" (Omnitudo Realitatis) and not as a priori principle.
Numen is a form of energy that can transform into the energy of disjunctive inscription (Numen).
In Schreber's view, Numen represents a new form of divine energy.
The body without organs is not God, but the energy that sweeps through it is divine, attracting to itself the entire process of production and server and inscribing it in each and every one of its disjunctions.
In his view, God is inseparable fromdisjunctive syllogism/, which means He controls all processes within this framework. This energy called Numen transforms into the energy of disjunctive inscription when it enters a physical body without organs. Here, Numen represents divine energy working through the bodiless structure while God remains its guiding force behind the scenes. [/ENDINST]Of [INST]this kind[], we can understand Schreber's perspective as viewing God as the architect of "disjunctive syllogism" or "Omnitudo Realitatis," serving as a driving force beyond human comprehension while Numen manifests this divine energy within physical structures without organs. This energy, when transformed into disjunctive inscription, becomes an embodiment of God's presence and control over processes within the given framework.[/ENDINST]

According to Sigmund Freud, paranoia and paranoia are the products of condensa- tions and identifications which occur in the unconscious.
According to Freud, the Oedipus complex is formed by the recording of desire and involves various stages in the formation.
In Beckett's "Desiring-MACHINES 13," Molloy is cross-examined by a policeman during his desiring-production.
Molloy's name is MollOY and he is asked by the policeman about his mother's paranoia.
Freud suggests that disjunctions appear only as a result of the projection of a more basic, primordial condensed material.In this given passage, Freud's theories on psychology are being discussed alongside Samuel Beckett's work titled "Desiring-MACHINES 13." Sigmund Freud believes that paranoia and paranoia are derived from unconscious processes called condensations and identifications. Furthermore, Freud associates the Oedipus complex with desires recorded in an individual's psyche, involving various stages of formation.

In Beckett's play, a character named Molloy encounters questioning by a policeman during his own desire production phase. Molloy's name is significant as it consists of "OY," which may be related to Freudian concepts. The policeman asks Molloy about his mother's paranoia, adding another layer to the connection with Freud's ideas.

Freud posits that disjunctions appear only after projecting a more fundamental condensed material from deeper within the psyche. This implies that Molloy's situation in Beckett's play may be reflective of these underlying principles Freud proposed regarding human psychology.

The sergeant told Schreber that his mother's name is likely to be Molloy.
Schreber was taken away to a guardroom and told to sit down implying that he had tried to explain.
In psychoanalysis, the concept of the Oedipal triangle is used as a frame of reference to explain so-called psychotic phenomena.
According to the psychoanalyst, in order to understand psychotic phenomena, one needs to uncover the father beneath the superior God, the elder brother beneath his inferior God, and the superior and inferior God beneath his father and brother.
The schizophrenic can lose his patience and demands to be left alone, but at other times he goes along with the process and introduces hisinner thoughts/.These inner thoughts are often contradictory and confusing for others around him.[SUB]In this context,_schizophrenic_ refers to someone experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia._

Antonin Artaud identifies himself as a son, father, mother, and himself.
He does not believe in father or mother.
Desiring-production forms a binary-linear system.
The full body is introduced as a third term in the series.
This series is completely refractory to transcription and transformation into a specific ternary and triangular schema such as Oedipus.
A body without organs is produced as an antiproduction, which is to say it intervenes within the process and rejects any attempts to impose on it.
Artaud has always been his father and he has beenm  yson.This passage discusses Antonin Artaud's identification of himself in various roles while also expressing his disbelief in traditional gender norms associated with fatherhood and motherhood. It further elaborates on the concept of desiring-production forming a binary-linear system that introduces the full body as a third term. The text concludes by stating that this series resists being transformed into a conventional triangular schema such as Oedipus, while emphasizing the notion of an "antiproduction" which rejects imposing any structure on it.[CREF]{PHRASES:"Antonin Artaud identifies himself as a son, father, mother, and himself.", "He does not believe in father or mother.", "Desiring-production forms a binary-linear system.", "The full body is introduced as a third term in the series.", "This series is completely refractory to transcription and transformation into a specific ternary and triangular schema such as Oedipus.", "A body without organs is produced as an antiproduction, which is to say it intervenes within the process"}

Adolf Wolfli's drawings reveal the workings of various machines, including clocks, turbines, dynamos, celestial machines, house-machines, and various other machines.
Adolf's explanations for these machines are based on genealogical series that form the basis of each of his drawings.
When the schizophrenic is not in a touchy mood, he accepts the banal Oedipal code provided he can cram it full of all the disjunctions that the code was designed to eliminate.
Despite the multiple codes, the result of each machine is always the same, regardless of the disjuncts, as indicated by Adolf's drawings.
In this given text, we can understand that Adolf Wolfli creates detailed illustrations representing different types of machines such as clocks, turbines, dynamos, celestial machines, house-machines, etc. His explanations for these machines are based on genealogical series which form the foundation of his drawings. When an individual with schizophrenic tendencies is not in a touchy mood and accepts the simplified Oedipal code provided he can fill it up with disjunctions that were meant to be excluded from the code itself. It is mentioned that despite various codes and disjuncts, the result of each machine remains consistent as shown by Adolf's drawings.

To summarize this passage briefly: Adolf Wolfli creates illustrations depicting diverse machines with explanations based on genealogical series. Schizophrenic individuals accept Oedipal codes filled with disjuncts when not touchy but results remain consistent in Adolf's drawings regardless of these factors.

"The Des1RING-MACHINES" is a series of stories about entities that can enter into changeable and genealogically complex relationships with God and forms of God by division.
These relationships are recorded on the surface of the body without any organs.
The process of recording involves the production and consumption of material, which is related to the process of production.
In this process, the subject has no fixed identity and can be discerned through the disjunctions of a recording surface.
Despite the existence of the subject, the body remains peripheral to the desiring-machines, with the individual being defined by the share of material it consumes and the states it consumes.
Des1The series "The Desiring-Machines" explores entities engaging in intricate relationships with divine beings through division and transformation. These connections are manifested on the physical body without involving internal organs. The recording process entails material production and consumption, linked to the broader concept of creation itself.

In this dynamic scenario, subjects lack fixed identities and can be identified through the breaks in a recording surface. Although present within this framework, the body remains secondary to the desiring machines that define individuals by their consumed materials and experienced states.

The character Judge Schreber believes that cosmic sexual pleasure remains constant and that God will find a way to take pleasure with him, even if he must transform himself into a woman in order to do so.
Schreber experiences only a residual share of this cosmic pleasure and sees it as a recompense for his suffering and privation.
According to the character, God demands a constant state of enjoyment and demands the greatest possible output of spiritual voluptuousness.
The character feels justified in accepting a little sensual pleasure as a compensation for the inordinate amount of suffering he has experienced over the past years.
A part of the energy from sexual pleasure is transformed into the energy of recording (Numen).

In this passage, Judge Schreber's unique belief revolves around the idea that cosmic sexual pleasure remains consistent and unchanging. He believes God will find a way to experience pleasure with him regardless of any transformation he may need to undergo, such as transforming into a woman. This cosmic pleasure serves as a form of recompense for Schreber's suffering throughout his past years. Additionally, the passage mentions an energy transformation related to recording (Numen), which seems unrelated to Judge Schreber's beliefs but might be connected to another context within the broader text.

Robert Gie is a talented designer of paranoiac electrical machines who has been unable to free himself from the currents that have been tormenting him.
According to Freud, Robert Gie has been involved in a self-cure process and has finally joined forces with these currents.
Freud suggests that such a reconciliation is possible.
A key turning point in the story is when Schreber becomes a woman and embarks on a process that brings him back to the equation Nature = Production (the production of a new humanity).
Schreber finds himself frozen in the pose and trapped in the paraphernalia of a transvestite at a moment when he has the ability to become a woman.
RobertGie's unusual predicament stems from his fascination with electrical machinery and its impact on his psyche. His talent lies in creating intricate designs for these devices, but they have also become a source of torment due to their constant presence in his life. Freud's perspective suggests that Robert has been engaged in an internal healing process where he ultimately aligns himself with these currents rather than fighting against them.

In Freudian terms, this self-cure process signifies Robert's acceptance and reconciliation with the electrical forces affecting him. This reconciliation is seen as possible by Freud due to his understanding of human psychology.

A significant turning point in the narrative occurs when Schreber (Robert Gie) transitions into becoming a woman. This transformation becomes a catalyst for a process that brings him closer to Nature's equation of Production – the creation of a new humanity. During this moment, Schreber finds himself frozen in a pose while trapped within the paraphernalia associated with being a transvestite. Despite his ability to assume a female form at will, he remains fixed in this position as if caught mid-transformation.

Michel Carrouges has identified a number of fantastic "celibate machines" in works of literature, including Marcel Duchamp's painting "La Mariee mise a nu par ses celibataires, meme", Kafka's "In the Penal Colony," Raymond Roussel's machines, Jarry's Surmale (Supermale), Edgar Allan Poe's machines and Villiers's Eve fu ture (The Futur e EThe given passage talks about Michel Carrouges finding several remarkable instances of "celibate machines" in various literary works.

"ANTI-OEDIPUS" is a character who experiences intensities, becomings, transitions, and transitions.
These intensities are created by the opposition of two forces, repulsion and attraction.
The intensities themselves are positive and positive in relation to the zero intensity that designates the full body without organs.
They undergo relative rises or falls depending on the relationship between the forces of attraction and repulsion, and the variations in the relative strength of these forces.
Kantian's theory of intensities suggests that they are an open series of positive elements, not an expression of the final equilibrium of a system, but an unlimited number of stationary, metastable states through which subjects pass.In "Anti-Oedipus," the central character encounters various transformations and transitions due to conflicting forces of repulsion and attraction. These intensities are considered positive in relation to a baseline state representing a body without organs.

The fluctuations in intensity levels depend on the balance between these opposing forces. Kantian's theory emphasizes that these intensities form an ongoing series of positive elements rather than representing the ultimate equilibrium of a system. Instead, they signify a multitude of temporary stable states through which subjects move dynamically.

This continuous evolution reflects the ever-changing nature of experiences and relationships in Anti-Oedipus's narrative world. It highlights how individuals navigate through life by adapting to shifting circumstances and opposing forces that shape their identities and emotions. [CULT]

In "Anti-Oedipus," the protagonist navigates a world governed by conflicting forces of repulsion and attraction, which generate intense experiences and transitions. These intensities are positive compared to a baseline state representing a body without organs.

Their level varies according to the tug-of-war between these opposing energies—an indication that they aren't fixed states but rather dynamic processes. Kantian theory frames them as an unending series of positive elements, not expressing a final equilibrium but rather countless stationary yet metastable states through which subjects move and evolve.

This portrayal underscores the fluidity of life experiences and relationships within Anti-Oedipus's narrative realm. It emphasizes how individuals adapt to changing circumstances and opposing forces that shape their identities and emotions throughout

The experience of having breasts does not resemble breasts and does not represent them, just like a predestined zone in the egg resembles the organ that is going to be stimulated to produce within it.
There are no representative emotions in the scene, only bands of intensity, thresholds, and gradients.
W.R.Bion is the first to stress the importance of the / fee/, but he places it in the realm of fantasy and makes it an affective parallel to the / think/ concept.
In Elements of Psycho-analysis (London: Heinemann, 1963), pp.94ff and 95ff, Bion describes a harrowing, emotionally overwhelming experience which brings the schizo as close as possible tothe reality principle/, but he does not equate it with the / think/.
The experience of having breasts is compared to an egg's predestined zone representing its stimulated organ. Bion emphasizes the importance of 'fee', placing it in fantasy realms as an emotional parallel to 'think'. In Elements of Psychoanalysis, he describes a deeply intense emotional event which brings the schizo closest to reality principle but doesn't equate it with 'think'.

Oedipus is portrayed as a person who consumes daddy-and-mommy relationships and nothing else.
The concept of psychoanalysis suggests that the consumption of pure intensities has little to do with family figures.
In Beckett's Unnamable, the subject is produced as a residuum alongside a machine and passes through a series of circles with no fixed identity and no fixed states.
Beckett's "unnamable" consists of a succession of irregular, sharp and short lines, similar to a parabolic sweep.
These circles are connected by the connective tissue of the "psychoanalysis, neurotic, daddy
The given passage discusses various concepts related to literature and psychology. It mentions three distinct ideas: Oedipus as a representation consumed in father-child relationships portrayals, psychoanalysis's stance on intense feelings versus family dynamics, Beckett's Unnamable character depiction, and its connection with circular states and sharp lines.

In the context of Oedipus, he is presented as someone deeply involved in stories involving father-child relationships dynamics. This indicates that his character often appears in narratives where parental bonds play a significant role.

Psychoanalysis offers an alternative viewpoint on human emotions and behavior analysis. It suggests that intense feelings have little connection with family dynamics compared to the Oedipus example given earlier. This implies psychoanalytic theories may not necessarily focus on familial relationships when examining emotional intensity.

Beckett's Unnamable characterizes a subject who exists alongside a machine and traverses through various circles without a fixed identity or state. The description compares these circular movements to sharp lines, which resemble a parabolic sweep. These connections are held together by the thread of psychoanalysis and neurotic father-child relationships.

In summary, the passage discusses how Oedipus represents characters involved in father-child dynamics while contrasting it with psychoanalytic perspectives on intense emotions versus family ties. It also connects Beckett's Unnamable character to circular states and sharp lines while emphasizing their association with psychoanalysis and neurotic daddy relationships.

The paranoiac machine and the miraculating machine produce a series of states in the celibate machine.
The subject is born of each state and is continually reborn of the following state, consuming-consuming all the states that cause him to be born and reborn.
Klossowski has demonstrated the presence of the Stimmung as a material emotion, constitutive of the most lofty thought and the most acute perception.
Despite the centrifugal forces fleeing from the center, individuals can experience violent oscillations that overwhelm them if they seek only their own center and are incapable of seeing the circle of individuals of which they are part.
Notes: This passage discusses various machines as metaphors for different concepts related to thought processes and emotions. Klossowski refers to Stimmung as a material emotion that plays a significant role in high thought and keen perception. The centrifugal forces represent diverging energies away from the center, while violent oscillations can overwhelm individuals if they fail to recognize their place within a larger circle of people.

Nietzsche is a professor of philology who identifies states with the names of history.
The narrative is about a "desiring-machine" that has been abandoned by the ego and is a remnant subject of a celibate machine referred to as the "Eternal Return".
The desiring machine produces a euphoric reward (Voluptas) from everything it turns out.
According to Nietzsche, this process is the result of residues of his histrioni-cism.

In this passage, we can understand that Nietzsche holds the position of a professor focused on philology studies. His unique perspective involves linking states with historical events or instances. Additionally, there is mentioned a concept called "desiring-machine," which represents an abandoned ego entity referred to as the "Eternal Return." This machine generates a sense of pleasure known as Voluptas from its activities. Nietzsche attributes this phenomenon to residual effects of his histrioni-cism - possibly indicating some form of acting or performing tendencies related to his theories.

Nietzsche's vision of the world is a parody of the process of recollection of an event.
Holderlin, a character in The Desiring-MACHINES, experiences a deep and prolonged euphoria and contemplation of the past.
According to psychiatrist G. de Clerambault, delirium is a secondary phenomenon, a consequence of partial and local automatistic phenomena.
Delirium can be character-driven by the production of the desiring-machines.
Despite the presence of syntheses and disorders,Nietzsche's understanding of reality diverges from conventional perspectives.[ERN]

[SUM]: Nietzsche's perspective on reality differs from traditional views as his vision is portrayed as a parody of recollection process while Holderlin experiences intense euphoria and contemplation linked to past events. Additionally, psychiatrist G. de Clerambault suggests delirium as a secondary phenomenon resulting from partial automatistic phenomena related to desiring-machines' production.

Clerambault sees delirium as an effect of automatism rather than a process of economic production involving desires.
He considers deliria to be a reaction and a character-related phenomenon linked to "character" or "automatism".
He suggests that deliriation might precede the automatism.
Cler Ambault views history as an aspect of a reaction rather than an economic process.
In his view, Clerambault's view of history is related to character and automatism and not to economic production.The given paragraph discusses how Clerambault perceives delirium differently compared to its relation with economic processes involving desires. Instead, he views it as a reaction linked to "character" or "automatism." Additionally, his perspective on history is contrasted against economic processes, positioning it closer to character-related phenomena and automatism.

The third concept is a descriptive one related to finding or rediscovering the delirious person in his own specific world.
The concept of schizophrenia is related to the ego through the intermediary of the "body image".
The body image is described as the final avatar of the soul, a vague conjoining of spiritualism and positivism.
According to the third concept, the ego is like daddy-mommy and the schizo has long since ceased believing in it.
There are those who maintain that the schizophrenic is incapable of uttering the word "J" and argue for the need to restore his ability to do so.
In response to these arguments, the Schizo expresses his frustration and expresses his
disbelief in any connection between himself and the concept of 'daddy' or 'mommy'. He vehemently denies any association with those terms as they pertain to his ego. The schizophrenic maintains that he has never believed in an 'ego', nor does he recognize its relevance within his own specific world. This stance is taken despite the insistence of some individuals who claim that the schizo's capacity to utter the word 'J' represents a symbolic link to his ego and needs restoration. In this context, the schizophrenic finds himself at odds with those who argue for such connections between him and traditional familial roles ('daddy'/'mommy').

According to Freud, autism was misapplied to schizophrenia.
Freud dislikes schizophrenics because he dislikes their resistance to being oedipalized.
He describes schizophrenics as apathetic, narcissistic, cut off from reality, incapable of achieving transference, and like philosophers.
The Oedipus complex is a major part of Freud's analysis.
In psychoanalysis, the relationship between drives (pulsions) and symptoms is not causal but a relationship of comprehension orunderstanding.[PENDINGHANDLETAILOR]The given paragraph discusses Freud's perspective on autism being mistakenly associated with schizophrenia. It also mentions his dislike for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia due to their resistance against being "oedipalized." Freud describes schizophrenics as apathetic, narcissistic, detached from reality, unable to achieve transference (a concept related to psychoanalysis), and similar to philosophers. The Oedipus complex plays a significant role in Freud's analysis within psychoanalytic theory.[PENDINGEND]

In this paragraph, Freud connects autism with a misinterpretation involving schizophrenia. He holds negative feelings towards individuals diagnosed as schizophrenics due to their resistance against being "oedipalized," which refers to the application of Freudian theories related to psychological development. Schizophrenics are described by Freud as apathetic, narcissistic, detached from reality, unable to achieve transference (a concept crucial in psychoanalysis), and similar to philosophers. Furthermore, the Oedipus complex plays a significant role within Freud's psychoanalytic framework.

According to Marx, schizophrenia is a phenomenon where we can "sample" an essence or a presumed specific nature of an individual, regardless of whether we do so with love and pity or disgustedly spit out the "mouthful" we have tasted.
The concept of schizophrenia is explained in terms of the ego.
We have "sampled" the individual schizophrenic multiple times, including once as a dissociated ego, another time as an ego cut off from the world, and yet again as a specific ego present in his own world but not dead.
According to the theory of schizophrenia, the specific nature and nature of a schizophrenic's personality becomes more specific and readily describable the more closely it is related to ideal formsThe given paragraph explains the concept of schizophrenia from Marx's perspective. It describes sampling an individual's essence or assumed unique traits irrespective of whether one feels love and pity or disgust towards them. The term ego refers to the schizophrenic phenomenon. Throughout this explanation, different instances of schizophrenia are mentioned such as a dissociated ego, an ego disconnected from the world, and a specific ego present in its own world but not dead. According to this theory, understanding a schizophrenic's personality becomes more detailed when related to ideal forms.

Karl Jaspers has written a book, ANTI-OEDIPUS, which explores the concept of schizophrenic disorder.
Jaspers sees schizophrenia as a process of the production of desire and desires and considers this process to be a rupture or intrusion from the ego.
He views the process as a relationship with nature, with the process having nothing to do with an imaginary relationship with the ego and instead focusing on the "demoniacal" nature of nature.
Despite his concept of process, Karl Jaspers fails to view it as material economic reality, instead viewing it as the process of production.
The traditional logic of desire, which places desire on the side of acquisition, is idealistic, according to Jaspers
In this passage, we learn about Karl Jaspers' book titled "ANTI-OEDIPUS." He discusses schizophrenic disorder in a unique way compared to traditional views. Instead of seeing it as an imaginary relationship with the ego, he considers it as a process related to nature and desires. This process is described as disruptive or intrusive, which contrasts with conventional desire logic that focuses on acquisition. Jaspers fails to view this phenomenon as material economic reality but rather interprets it as production.

Kant defines desire as the ability of desire to create its own object.
Kant uses superstitious beliefs, hallucinations, and fantasies as illustrations of this definition.
Despite the knowledge that the real object can only be produced by external causality and mechanisms, Kant believes in the intrinsic power of desire, even if only in an unreal, hallucinatory, or delirious form.
Desire produces an imaginary object that functions as a double of reality.
According to Kant, the object produced by desire is a "psychic reality" and not a natural or social production.
This conception of desire is explained perfectly by psychoanalysis.
In this passage, it is stated that Immanuel Kant defines desire as having the capacity to create its own object. He uses instances such as superstitious beliefs, hallucinations, and fantasies to illustrate his point. Despite acknowledging that real objects can only be generated through external causation and mechanisms, Kant still emphasizes the inherent power of desire even if it manifests in an unreal or imaginary way. This imagined object serves as a representation of reality created by desire itself. To Kant, this psychically produced object is termed as "psychic reality" rather than a natural or societal product. It is noted that psychoanalysis provides a perfect explanation for such a conception of desire.

Desire is presented as a specific and theatrical machine that produces fantasy.
In this interpretation, desire is defined as a relative lack and determined by its own object, whereas fantasy is seen as a production process that produces itself by detaching itself from the object and intensifying the absolute nature of the lack by making it absolute.
The concept of desire is supported by needs and these needs continue to be the basis of the productivity of desire.
Clement Rosset suggests that every time the emphasis is put on a lack that desire supposedly suffers from as a way of defining its object, the world acquires as its double some other sort of world.
According to Rosset, fantasy, desire,
which is inherently linked with needs and their satisfaction, becomes an absolute process when it detaches itself from its object and intensifies the lack by making it absolute. This allows fantasy to produce itself as a separate entity while maintaining its connection with needs that initially fueled it. The resulting fantasy world serves as a mirror image of the original one, reflecting its own nature through amplifying the sense of absence or lack inherent in desire.

Desire is a set of passive syntheses that engineer partial objects, flows, and bodies and function as units of production.
Desire and its object are one and the same thing: the machine of a machine connected to the process of producing.
Something is removed or deducted from the process, giving the subject a "residuum".
The objective being of Desire is the Real in and of itself.
There is no particular form of existence that can be identified as "psychic reality."
As Marx notes, what exists is not lack, but desire, an autoproduction of unconscious, fixed subject, and machine.
The above passage presents a philosophical perspective on desire as a concept closely related to production processes. It suggests that desire functions as units within these processes and serves as the driving force behind their operation. In this context, desire is not separate from its object but rather forms an integral part of the machine itself.

Additionally, the text mentions that something gets deducted or removed from the process, resulting in a "residuum" for the subject. This residuum represents what remains after the deduction and can be seen as an outcome of the production process.

Furthermore, the objective being of desire is referred to as the Real - an inherent aspect within itself. The text emphasizes that there isn't any identifiable form of psychic reality distinct from desire's role in generating unconscious fixed subjects and machines.

In summary, this philosophical view portrays desire as a fundamental component of production processes, closely tied to their operation and functioning as units within these systems. It also highlights the connection between desire and its object while acknowledging the residuum resulting from deductions within these processes.

Desire is a search for something or something to consume.
Desire expresses an abject fear of lacking something.
This fear is not expressed by the poor or the dispossessed, but by those who know they are close to grass, almost akin to it.
The objectivity of desire is to produce within the realm of the real, which is the objective being of man.
Within the real everything is possible, and desire deprives desire of its objective being.This poem conveys several ideas about desire. One important concept is that desire can be interpreted as both a search for something and an expression of fear related to lacking something. This duality suggests that people seek fulfillment while also recognizing the potential consequences of not having what they want.

Another significant theme in this passage is the distinction between different social groups. It implies that those who understand their proximity to basic necessities (such as food or shelter) are more likely to express fear associated with desire compared to those who lack such essentials and therefore have less to lose. This suggests that privilege can influence how people experience desire differently.

Finally, the poem discusses objectivity in relation to desire. Objectivity refers to the attempt to create within reality what one desires. However, it also implies that desire itself becomes detached from its objective being when it is fulfilled or denied within the realm of reality. This suggests that desire can be both a motivating force and an obstacle to overcome simultaneously.

Overall, this poem explores desire as a complex phenomenon with various dimensions such as search, fear, social distinction, privilege, objectivity, and its relationship with reality.

Lacan's theory of desire appears to have two poles: one related to "the object small a" as a "desiring-machine" and the other related to a "great Other" which reintroduces a certain notion of lack.
Lacan believes that revolutionaries, artists, and seers are objective, objective, and have no illusions about duty, the perpetuation of their kin, or the preservation of their interests.
In Serge Leclaire's article "La re'alite du desir" (Ch.4, reference note 26), the phantasmal world is defined as a world which has never been fully conquered by the state.
The given passage primarily discusses Lacan's theory of desire with two contrasting aspects: one centered on "the object small a" as a "desiring-machine," while the other revolves around a notion called the "great Other" that introduces an element of lack. Additionally, it mentions Serge Leclaire's article "La réalité du désir" (Chapter 4), where the phantasmal world is described as a realm never completely controlled by the state.

In this context, Lacan's revolutionary individuals, artists, and seers are portrayed as objective entities who do not entertain illusions about their responsibilities such as duty, preservation of kinship ties, or protection of personal interests.
