The idea of the "unconscious" is not a new one. It has been 
considered by many philosophers and sociologists. In the 19th century, 
Hegel and Marx  were the first to suggest that the "unconscious" 
is not a separate entity but a part of the social and economic 
processes. Marx  and Engels  were the first to suggest that the 
unconscious is the product of the social and economic processes. 
In the 20th century, the concept of the unconscious has been 
replaced by the concept of the unconscious

leave desire in the hands of new experts. It must analyze the function of 
desire, in itself and in the groups with which it is involved. What is the 
function of desire, Anti-Oedipus asks, if not one of making connections?

The above text is taken from the article "The 1950s and 60s: The 20th Century 
in the United States" by Stephen K. Karp, published by the University of
Michigan Press in 1996.

socialists of the twentieth century, on the other hand, are not the

the former are the means of realizing their ideas, and so on. Thus,

t Institutional analysis is the more political tendency of institutional psychotherapy, begun in the late 1950s 
as an attempt to collectively deal with what psychoanalysis so hypocritically avoided, namely the 
psychoses. La Borde Clinic, established in 1955 by Jean Oury of the Ecole Freudienne de Paris, served as the 
loci for discussions on institutional psychotherapy, and Jacques Lacan's seminars served as the 
intellectual basis for these discussions.

The above text is the text of a speech given by the American writer and philosopher

The development of distinctions between group and individual 
fantasy shows sufficiently well, at last, that there is no individual 
fantasy. Instead there are two types of groups, subject-groups and 
subjugated groups, with Oedipus and castration forming the imaginary 
structure under which members of the subjugated groups are induced to 
live or fantasize individually their membership in the group. It must 
still be said that the two types of groups are perpetually shifting, a 
subject-group always being threatened with subjugation, a subjugated 
group capable in

The same is true of the Oedipal code: the libido as energy of 
selection and detachment is converted into the phallus as detached object, the 
 latter existing only in the transcendent form of stock and lack  (something 
common and absent that is just as lacking in men as in women). It is this conversion 
that makes the whole of sexuality shift into the Oedipal framework: this 
projection of all the breaks-flows onto the same mythical locale, and all the 
 nonsignifying signs into the same major signifier.

sumption, we have seen how the body without organs was in fact an egg,
crisscrossed with axes, banded with zones, localized with areas and 
fields, measured off by gradients, traversed by potentials, marked by 
thresholds. In this sense, we believe in a biochemistry of schizophrenia 
(in conjunction with the biochemistry of drugs), that will be progressively 
more capable of determining the nature of this egg and the distribution of 
field-gradient-threshold. It is a matter of relationships of intensities

For the earth is not merely the multiple and divided object of labor, it is 
also the unique, indivisible entity, the full body that falls back on the 
forces of production and appropriates them for its own as the natural or 
divine precondition. While the ground can be the productive element

The full body of the earth is not without distinguishing 
characteristics. Suffering and dangerous, unique, universal, it falls back on 
production, on the agents and connections of production. But on it, too, 
everything is attached and inscribed, everything is attracted, miraculated. It 
is the basis of the disjunctive synthesis and its reproduction: a pure force of 
filiation or genealogy, Numen. The full body is the unengendered, but filiation 
is the first character of inscription marked on this body. And we know

The second point of view is that alliances are the result of a process of 
reproduction, of the creation of a new system of relationships, of the creation of 
an extended family. This is the case, for example, of the family of the Dogon, 
who, in the course of the 19th century, were the first to adopt the system of 
alliance. In this system the family was the object of an extended family, 
which was the object of an extended family. This extended family was the

more than a mythical expression. The signs cease to be ambiguous at the same time as they are determined in relation to the extended filiations and the lateral alliances: the disjunctions become exclusive, restrictive (the "either/or else" 
replaces the intense "either... or... or..."); the names, the appellations no

new way in which capitalism uses the 2nd-order social images.

"

The family becomes the subaggregate to which the whole of the 
social field is applied. Since each person has his own private father and
mother, it is a distributive subaggregate that simulates for each person the 
collective whole of social persons and that closes off his domain and 
scrambles his images. Everything is reduced to the father-mother-child 
triangle, which reverberates the answer "daddy-mommy

"
The text is a very interesting one, and it is not a text that is only
in the capitalist formation that the Oedipal limit finds itself not only 
occupied, but inhabited and lived, in the sense in which the social images 
produced by the decoded flows actually fall back on restricted familial images 
invested by desire. It is at this point in the Imaginary that Oedipus is constituted, 
at the same time as it completes its migration in the in-depth elements of 
representation

makes the displaced limit pass between the Symbolic and the Imaginary, 
between symbolic castration and imaginary Oedipus. For

The following text is from the text of the 1961 lecture "The Unconscious" by
Leclaire. In it, Leclaire discusses the nature of the unconscious and the
nature of the unconscious as a whole.

The unconscious is a part of the unconscious. It is the part of the unconscious 
that is not conscious. It is the part of the unconscious that is not conscious

The body without organs is the immanent substance, in the most Spinozist sense 
of the word; and the partial objects are like its ultimate attributes, which belong 
to it precisely insofar as they are really distinct and cannot on this account 
exclude or oppose one another. The partial objects and the body without organs are 
the two material elements of the schizophrenic desiring-machines: the one as the 
immobile motor, the others as the working parts; the one as the giant molecule, 
the others as the micromolecules—the two together in a relationship of

ization of the whole body. But the 
code is not a mere code, but a code of the whole body without organs. The 
code is a code of the whole body with organs, and it is a code of the whole body 
without organs. The code is not a code of the whole body, but a code of the 
whole body with organs. In this sense, the code is a code of the whole body without

The most important point to be made here is that the meaning of the 
signifier is not determined by the structure of the signifier itself, 
but by the structure of the signifier itself as a whole. This is 
the main point of the present discussion. 

The first step in the process of the construction of a meaning is to 
identify the signifier itself, and then to identify the signifier 
as a whole. This is done by identifying the signifier as a whole 
with the whole of the signifier. 

The second step in the process


The meaning of the word “code” is not a mere technicality, but a 
semantic one. It is a word that is not only a signifier of the meaning of the 
word, but also of the meaning of the word itself. The meaning of the word 
is not a mere technicality, but a signifier of the meaning of the word.
The meaning of the word is not a mere technicality, but a signifier of the

*The verb se rabattre sur (and the noun rebattemenl), used by the authors here and in numerous instances in 
the text below, has several different connotations, as lor instance: in descriptive geometry, to describe the 
rotation of a plane so as to coincide with another plane, usually followed by a reverse rotation back into

The family becomes the subaggregate to which the whole of the 
social field is applied. Since each person has his own private father and
mother, it is a distributive subaggregate that simulates for each person the 
collective whole of social persons and that closes off his domain and 
scrambles his images. Everything is reduced to the father-mother-child

occupied, but inhabited and lived, in the sense in which the social images
