I even saw in them at times a superfetatory proof of the existence 
of God.Go, I said, but be back at half-past four, I want to talk 
to you.Yes papa, he said.Yes papa!Ah!I slept a little.Faster, fastir.Passing the church, something 
made me stop.I looked at the door, baroque, very fine.I found 
it hideous.I hastened on to the presbytery.The Father is sleeping, 
said the servant.I can wait, I said.Is it urgent?she said.Yes 
and no, I said.She showed me into the sitting-room, bare and 
bleak, dreadful.Father Ambrose came in, rubbing his eyes.I 
disturb you.Father, I said.He clicked his tongue against the roof 
of his mouth, protestingly.I shall not describe our attitudes, 
characteristic his of him, mine of me.He offered me a cigar which 
I accepted with good grace and put in my pocket, between my 
fountain-pen and my propelling-pencil.He flattered himself.Father 
Ambrose, with being a man of the world and knowing its ways, 
he who never smoked.And everyone said he was most broad.I 
asked him if he had noticed my son at the last mass.Certainly, he 
said, we even spoke together.I must have looked surprised.Yes, 
he said, not seeing you at your place, in the front row, I feared 
you were ill.So I called for the dear child, who reassured me.A 
most untimely visitor, I said, whom I could not shake off in time.So your son explained to me, he said.He added.

But let us sit 
down, we have no train to catch.He laughed and sat down, hitch- 
ing up his heavy cassock.May I offer you a little glass of some- 
thing?he said.I was in a quandary.Had Jacques let slip an allusion 
to the lager.He was quite capable of it.I came to ask you a favour, 
I said.Granted, he said.We observed each other.It’s this, I said, 
Sunday for me without the Body and Blood is like — .He raised 
his hand.Above all no profane comparisons, he said.Perhaps he 
was thinking of the kiss without a moustache or beef without

said, a wink is as good as a nod, you want communion.I bowed 
my head.It’s a little unusual, he said.I wondered if he had fed.I 
knew he was given to prolonged fasts, by way of mortification 
certainly, and then because his doctor advised it.Thus he killed 
two birds with one stone.Not a word to a soul, he said, let it 
remain between us and — .He broke off, raising a finger, and his 
eyes, to the ceiling.Heavens, he said, what is that stain?I looked 
in turn at the ceiling.Damp, I said.Tut tut, he said, how annoying.The words tut tut seemed to me the maddest I had heard.There 
are times, he said, when one feols like weeping.He got up.I’ll 
go and get my kit, he said.He called that his kit.Summarization models summary:

Alone, my hands 
clasped until it seemed my knuckles would crack, I asked the Lord 
for guidance.Without result.That was some consolation.As for 
Father Ambrose, in view of his alacrity to fetch his kit, it seemed 
evident to me he suspected nothing.Or did it amuse him to see 
how far I would go?Or did it tickle him to have me commit a 
sin?I summarised the situation briefly as follows.If knowing I 
have beer taken he gives me the sacrament, his sin, if sin there be, 
is as great as mine.I was therefore risking little.He came back with 
a kind of portable pyx, opened it, and dispatched me without an 
instant’s hesitation.I rose and thanked him warmly.Pah !he said, 
it’s nothing.Now we can talk.I had nothing else to say to him.All I wanted was to return 
home as quickly as possible and stuff myself with stew.My soul 
appeased, I was ravenous.But being slightly in advance of my 
schedule I resigned myself to allowing him eight minutes.They 
seemed endless.He informed me that Mrs Clement, the chemist’s 
wife and herself a highly qualified chemist, had fallen, in her 
laboratory, from the top of a ladder, and broken the neck — .The 
neck!I cried.Of her femur, he said, can’t you let me finish.He 
added that it was bound to happen.

And I, not to be outdone, 
told him how worried I was about my hens, particularly my grey 
hen, which would neither brood nor lay and for the past month 
and more had done nothing but sit with her arse in the dust, from 
morning to night.Like Job, haha, he said.I too said haha.What 
a joy it is to laugh, from time to time, he said.Is it not?I 
said.It is peculiar to man, he said.So I have noticed, I said.102
SAMUEL BECKETT
A brief silence ensued.What do you feed her on?he said.Com 
chiefly, I said.Cooked or raw?he said.Both, I said.I added 
that she ate nothing any more.Nothing !he cried.Next to nothing, 
I said.Animals never laugh, he said.It takes us to find that funny, 
I said.What?he said.It takes us to find that funny, I said loudly.He mused.Christ never laughed either, he said, so far as we know.He looked at me.Can you wonder?I said.There it is, he said.He smiled sadly.She has not the pip, I hope, he said.I said she 
had not, certainly not, anything he liked, but not the pip.He 
meditated..Have you tried bicarbonate?he said.I beg your par- 
don?I said.Bicarbonate of soda, he said, have you tried it?Why 
no, I said.Try it!he cried, flushing with pleasure, have her 
swallow a few dessertspoonfuls, several times a day, for a few 
months.You’ll see, you won’t know her.Summarization models summary:

A powder?I said.Bless 
my heart to be sure, he said.Many thanks, I said.I’ll begin today.Such a fine hen, he said, such a good layer.Or rather tomorrow, 
I said.I had forgotten the chemist was closed.Except in case of 
emergency.And now that little cordial, he said, I declined.This interview with Father Ambrose left me with a painful 
impression.He was still the same dear man, and yet not.I seemed 
to have surprised, on his face, a lack, how shall I say, a lack of 
nobility.The host, it is only fair to say, was lying heavy on my 
stomach.And as I made my way home I felt like one who, having 
swallowed a pain-killer, is first astonished, then indignant, on ob- 
taining no relief.And I was almost ready to suspect Father Am- 
brose, alive to my excesses of the forenoon, of having fobbed me 
off with unconsccrated bread.Or of mental reservation as he pro- 
nounced the magic words.And it was in vile humour that I arrived 
home, in the pelting rain.The stew was a great disappointment.Where are the onions?I cried.Gone to nothing, replied Martha.I rushed into the kitchen, 
to look for the onions I suspected her of having removed from the 
pot, because she knew how much I liked them.I even rummaged 
in the bin.Nothing.She watched me mockingly.I went up to my room again, drew back the curtains on a 
calamitous sky and lay down.I could not understand what was 
happening to me.I found it painful at that period not to under-MOLLO Y
103
stand.

I tried to pull myself together.In vain.I might have known.My life was running out, I knew not through what breach.I suc- 
ceeded however in dozing off, which is not so easy, when pain is 
speculative.And I was marvelling, in that half-sleep, at my half- 
sleeping, when my son came in, without knocking.Now if there 
is one thing I abhor, it is someone coming into my room, without 
knocking.I might just happen to be masturbating, before my 
cheval-glass.Father with yawning fly and starting eyes, toiling to 
scatter on the ground his joyless seed, that was no sight for a small 
boy.Harshly I recalled him to the proprieties.He protested he 
had knocked twice.If you had knocked a hundred times, I replied, 
it would not give you the right to come in without being invited.But, he said.But what?I said.You told me to be here at half- 
past four, he said.There is something, I said, more important in 
life than punctuality, and that is decorum.Repeat.In that disdain- 
ful mouth my phrase put me to shame.He was soaked.What 
have you been looking at?I said.The liliaceae, papa, he answered.The liliaceae papa!My son had a way of saying papa, when he 
wanted to hurt me, that was very special.Now listen to me, I said.His face took on an expression of anguished attention.We leave 
this evening, I said in substance, on a journey.Put on your school 
suit, the green — .But it’s blue, papa, he said.Summarization models summary:

He was still there.I asked him what he was waiting for to do as 
I had told him.If I had been my son I would have left me 
long ago.He was not worthy of me, not in the same class at all.I could not escape this conclusion.Cold comfort that is, to feel 
superior to one’s son, and hardly sufficient to calm the remorse 
of having begotten him.May I bring my stamps?he said.My son 
had two albums, a big one for his collection properly speaking 
and a small one for the duplicates.I authorised him to bring the 
latter.When I can give pleasure, without doing violence to my

I got up and went to the window.I could not keep still.I 
passed my head between the curtains.Fine rain, lowering sky.He 
had not lied to me.Likely to lift round about eight.Fine sunset, 
twilight, night.Waning moon, rising towards midnight.I rang for 
Martha and lay down again.We shall dine at home, I said.She looked at me in astonishment.Did we not always dine at 
home?I had not yet told her we were leaving.I would not 
tell her till the last moment, one foot in the stirrup as the 
saying is.I did not wholly trust her.I would call her at the last 
moment and say, Martha, we’re leaving, for one day, two days, 
three days, a week, two weeks, God knows, goodbye.It was im- 
portant to leave her in the dark.Then why had I called her?She 
would have served us dinner in any case, as she did every day.

I had made the mistake of putting myself in her place.That was 
understandable.But to tell her we would dine at home, what a 
blunder.For she knew it already, thought she knew, did know.And as a result of this useless reminder she would sense that some- 
thing was afoot and spy on us, in the hope of learning what it was.First mistake.The second, first in time, was my not having enjoined 
my son to keep what I had told him to himself.Not that this 
would have served any purpose.Nevertheless I should have in- 
sisted on it, as due to myself.I was floundering.I so sly as a rule.I tried to mend matters, saying, A little later than usual, not before 
nine.She turned to go, her simple mind already in a turmoil.I 
am at home to no one, I said.I knew what she would do, she 
would throw a sack over her shoulders and slip off to the bottom 
of the garden.There she would call Hannah, the old cook of the 
Eisner sisters, and they would whisper together for a long time, 
through the railings.Hannah never went out, she did not like 
going out.The Eisner sisters were not bad neighbours, as neigh- 
bours go.They made a little too much music, that was the only 
fault I cr ild find with them.If there is one thing gets on my nerves 
it is music.What I assert, deny, question, in the present, I still can.But mostly I shall use the various tenses of the past.For mostly I 
do not know, it is perhaps no longer so, it is too soon to know, I 
simply do not know, perhaps shall never know.Summarization models summary:

SAMUEL BECKETT
I was thinking of the Eisner sisters.They had an aberdeen called 
Zulu.People called it Zulu.Sometimes, when I was in a good 
humour, I called, Zulu !Little Zulu !and he would come and talk 
to me, through the railings.But I had to be feeling gay.I don’t like 
animals.It’s a strange thing, I don’t like men and I don’t like 
animals.As for God, he is beginning to disgust me.Crouching down 
I would stroke his ears, through the railings, and utter wheedling 
words.He did not realise he disgusted me.He reared up on his 
hind legs and pressed his chest against the bars.Then I could see 
his little- black penis ending in a thin wisp of wetted hair.He felt 
insecure, his hams trembled, his little paws fumbled for purchase, 
one after the other.I too wobbled, squatting on my heels.With my 
free hand I held on to the railings.Perhaps I disgusted him too.I found it hard to tear myself away from these vain thoughts.I wondered, suddenly rebellious, what compelled me to accept 
this commission.But I had already accepted it, I had given my 
word.Too late.Honour.It did not take me long to gild my 
impotence.But could I not postpone our departure to the following day?Or leave alone?Ah shilly-shally.But we would wait till the very 
last moment, a little before midnight.This decision is irrevocable, 
I said.

It was justified moreover by the state of the moon.I did as when I could not sleep.I wandered in my mind, 
slowly, noting every detail of the labyrinth, its paths as familiar 
as those of my garden and yet ever new, as empty as the heart 
could wish or alive with strange encounters.And I heard the distant 
cymbals.There is still time, still time.But there was not, for I 
ceased, all vanished and I tried once more to turn my thoughts 
to the Molloy affair.Unfathomable mind, now beacon, now sea.The agent and the messenger.We agents never took anything 
in writing.Gaber was not an agent in the sense I was.Gaber was 
a messenger.He was therefore entitled to a notebook.A messenger 
had to be possessed of singular qualities, good messengers were 
even more rare than good agents.I who was an excellent agent 
would have made but a sorry messenger.I often regretted it.Gaber 
was protected in numerous ways.He used a code incomprehensible 
to all but himself.Each messenger, before being appointed, had toMOLLOY

submit his code to the directorate.Gaber understood nothing about 
the messages he carried.Reflecting on them he arrived at the 
most extravagantly false conclusions.Yes, it was not enough for 
him to understand nothing about them, he had also to believe he 
understood everything about them.This was not all.His memory 
was so bad that his messages had no existence in his head, but 
only in his notebook.He had only to close his notebook to become, 
a moment later, perfectly innocent as to its contents.Summarization models summary:

And when I 
say that he reflected on his messages and drew conclusions from 
them, it was not as we would hdVe reflected on them, you and I, 
the book closed and probably the eyes too, but little by little as he 
read.And when he raised his head and indulged in his commen- 
taries, it was without losing a second, for if he had lost a second 
he would have forgotten everything, both text and gloss.I have 
often wondered if the messengers were not compelled to undergo 
a surgical operation, to induce in them such a degree of amnesia.But I think not.For otherwise their memory was good enough.And I have heard Gaber speak of his childhood, and of his family, 
in extremely plausible terms.To be undecipherable to all but one- 
self, dead without knowing it to the meaning of one’s instructions 
and incapable of remembering them for more than a few seconds, 
these are capacities rarely united in the same individual.No less 
however was demanded of our messengers.And that they were more 
highly esteemed than the agents, whose qualities were sound rather 
than brilliant, is shown by the fact that they received a weekly 
wage of eight pounds as against ours of six pounds ten only, these 
figures being exclusive of bonuses and travelling expenses.And 
when I speak of agents and of messengers in the plural, it is with 
no guarantee of truth.For I had never seen any other messenger 
than Gaber nor any other agent than myself.But I supposed we 
were not the only ones and Gaber must have supposed the same.For the feeling that we were the only ones of our kind would, 
I believe, have been more than we could have borne.

And it must 
have appeared natural, to me, that each agent had his own particular 
messenger, and to Gaber that each messenger had his own particu- 
lar agent.Thus I was able to say to Gaber, Let him give this job 
to someone else, I don’t want it, and Gaber was able to reply.He108

wants it to be you.And these last words, assuming Gaber had 
not invented them especially to annoy me, had perhaps been 
uttered by the chief with the sole purpose of fostering our illusion, 
if it was one.All this is not very clear.That we thought of ourselves as members of a vast organisation 
was doubtless also due to the all too human feeling that trouble 
shared, or is it sorrow, is trouble something, I forget the word.But to me at least, who knew how to listen to the falsetto of reason, 
it was obvious that we were perhaps alone in doing what we did.Yes, in my moments of lucidity I thought it possible.And, to 
keep nothing from you, this lucidity was so acute at times that I 
came even to doubt the existence of Gaber himself.And if I had 
not hastily sunk back into my darkness I might have gone to the 
extreme of conjuring away the chief too and regarding myself as 
solely responsible for my wretched existence.For I knew I was 
wretched, at six pounds ten a week plus bonuses and expenses.And having made away with Gaber and the chief (one Youdi), 
could I have denied myself the pleasure of — you know.But I was 
not made for the great light that devours, a dim lamp was all I had 
been given, and patience without end, to shine it on the empty 
shadows.Summarization models summary:

in the chimney-corner, rocking herself moodily.This rocking-chair, 
she would have you believe, was the only possession to which she 
clung and she would not have parted with it for an empire.It is 
interesting to note that she had installed it not in her room, but 
in the kitchen, in the chimney-corner.Late to bed and early to

My weekly supply of lager, half-a-dozen quart bottles, was 
delivered every Saturday.I never touched them until the next day, 
for lager must be left to settle after the least disturbance.Of these 
six bottles Gaber and I, together, had emptied one.There should 
therefore be five left, plus the remains of a bottle from the previous 
week.I went into the pantry.

The five bottles were there, corked 
and sealed, and one open bottle three-quarters empty.Martha 
followed me with her eyes.I left without a word to her and went 
upstairs.I did nothing but go to and fro.I went into my son’s 
room.Sitting at his little desk he Was admiring his stamps, the two 
albums, large and small, open before him.On my approach he 
shut them hastily.I saw at once what he was up to.But first I said.Have you got your things ready?He stood up, got his pack and 
gave it to me.I looked inside.I put my hand inside and felt 
through the contents, staring vacantly before me.Everything was 
in.I gave it back to him.What are you doing?I said.Looking at 
my stamps, he said.You call that looking at your stamps?I said.Yes papa, he said, with unimaginable effrontery.Silence, you little 
liar!I cried.Do you know what he was doing?Transferring to 
the album of duplicates, from his good collection properly so-called, 
certain rare and valuable stamps which he was in the habit of 
gloating over daily and could not bring himself to leave, even for 
a few days.Show me your new Timor, the five reis orange, I said.He hesitated.Show it to me !I cried.I had given it to him myself, 
it had cost me a florin.A bargain, at the time.I’ve put it in here, 
he said piteously, picking up the album of duplicates.That was all 
I wanted to know, to hear him say rather, for I knew it already.Very good, I said.Summarization models summary:

with de’lcate steps, almost mincing, congratulating myself as usual

He did not move.To make assurance doubly sure, I said, we shall 
put the albums in the safe, until our return.He still did not move.Do you hear me?I said.He rose with a bound that knocked over 
his chair and uttered the furious words.Do what you like with 
them!I never want to see them again!Anger should be left to 
cool, in my opinion, crisis to pass, before one operates.I took the 
albums and withdrew, without a word.He had been lacking in 
respect, but this was not the moment to have him admit it.Motion- 
less in the corridor I heard sounds of falling and collision.Another, 
less master of himself than I of myself, would have intervened.But 
it did not positively displease me that my son should give free vent 
to his grief.It purges.Sorrow does more harm when dumb, to my 
mind.The albums under my arm, I returned to my room.

I had 
spared my son a grave temptation, that of putting in his pocket his 
most cherished stamps, in order to gloat on them, during our 
journey.Not that his having one or two stamps about him was 
reprehensible in itself.But it would have been an act of disobed- 
ience.To look at them he would have had to hide from his father.And when he had lost them, as he inevitably would, he would have 
been driven to lie, to account for their disappearance.No, if he 
could not really bear to be parted from the gems of his collection, 
it would have been better for him to take the entire album.For 
an album is less readily lost than a stamp.But I was a better judge 
than he of what he could and could not.For I knew what he did 
not yet know, among other things, that this ordeal would be of 
profit to him.Sollst entbehren, that was the lesson I desired to 
impress upon him, while he was still young and tender.Magic 
words which I had never dreamt, until my fifteenth year, could be 
coupled together.And should this undertaking make me odious 
in his eyes and not only me, but the very idea of fatherhood, I 
would pursue it 'none the less, with everything in my power.The 
thought that between my death and his own, ceasing for an 
instant from heaping curses on my memory, he might wonder, in 
a flash, whether I had not been right, that was enough for me, that 
repaid me for all the trouble I had taken and was still to take.He

the most of them.Because after dinner I drowse.I took off my 
coat and shoes, opened my trousers and got in between the sheets.It is lying down, in the warmth, in the gloom, that I best pierce 
the outer turmoil’s veil, discern my quarry, sense what course to 
follow, find peace in another’s ludicrous distress.Far from the 
world, its clamours, frenzies, bitterness and dingy light, I pass 
judgement on it and on those, 4ike me, who are plunged in it 
beyond recall, and on him who has need of me to be delivered, 
who cannot deliver myself.All is dark, but with that simple dark- 
ness that follows like a balm upon the great dismemberings.From 
their places masses move, stark as laws.Masses of what?One 
does not ask.There somewhere man is too, vast conglomerate of 
all of nature’s kingdoms, as lonely and as bound.And in that block 
the prey is lodged and thinks himself a being apart.Anyone would 
serve.But I am paid to seek.I arrive, he comes away.His life has 
been nothing but a waiting for this, to see himself preferred, to 
fancy himself damned, blessed, to fancy himself everyman, 
above all others.Warmth, gloom, smells of my bed, such is the 
effect they sometimes have on me.I get up, go out, and everything 
is changed.

The blood drains from my head, the noise of things 
bursting, merging, avoiding one another, assails me on all sides, 
my eyes search in vain for two things alike, each pinpoint of 
skin screams a different message, I drown in the spray of phe- 
nomena.It is at the mercy of these sensations, which happily I 
know to be illusory, that I have to live and work.It is thanks to 
them I find myself a meaning.So he whom a sudden pain awakes.He stiffens, ceases to breathe, waits, says.It’s a bad dream, or, it’s 
a touch of neuralgia, breathes again, sleeps again, still trembling.And yet J t is not unpleasant, before setting to work, to steep oneself 
again in this slow and massive world, where all things move with 
the ponderous sullenness of oxen, patiently through the immemorial 
ways, and where of course no investigation would be possible.But

For the falsity of the terms does not necessarily imply that 
of the relation, so far as I know.And not only this, but I should 
have invested my man, from the* outset, with the air of a fabulous 
being, which something told me could not fail to help me later on.So I took off my coat and my shoes, I opened my trousers and I 
slipped in between the sheets, with an easy conscience, knowing 
only too well what I was doing.Molloy, or Mollose, was no stranger to me.If I had had 
colleagues, I might have suspected I had spoken of him to them, 
as of one destined to occupy us, sooner or later.But I had no 
colleagues and knew nothing of the circumstances in which I had 
learnt of his existence.Perhaps I had invented him, I mean found 
him ready-made in my head.There is no doubt one sometimes 
meets with strangers who are not entire strangers, through their 
having played a part in certain cerebral reels.This had never 
happened to me, I considered myself immune from such exper- 
iences, and even the simple deja vu seemed infinitely beyond my 
reach.But it was happening to me then, or 1 was greatly mistaken.For who could have spoken to me of Molloy if not myself and to 
whom if not to myself could I have spoken of him?I racked my 
mind in vain.For in my rare conversations with men I avoided such 
subjects.If anyone else had spoken to me of Molloy 1 would have 
requested him to stop and I myself would not have confided his 
existence to a living soul for anything in the world.If I had had 
colleagues things would naturally have been different.

Among col- 
leagues one says things which in any other company one keeps 
to oneself.But I had no colleagues.And perhaps this accounts for 
the immense uneasiness I had been feeling ever since the beginning 
of this affair.For it is no small matter, for a grown man thinking

either, it seemed.But she was much less alive than her son, who 
God knows was far from being so.After all perhaps I knew nothing 
of mother Molloy, or Mollose, save in so far as such a son might 
bear, like a scurf of placenta, her stamp.Of these two names, Molloy and Mollose, the second seemed 
to me perhaps the more correct.But barely.What I heard, in my 
soul I suppose, where the acoustics are so bad, was a first syllable.Mol, very clear, followed almost at once by a second, very thick, 
as though gobbled by the first, and which might have been oy as 
it might have been ose, or one, or even oc.And if I incline 
towards ose, it was doubtless that my mind had a weakness for this 
ending, whereas the others left it cold.But since Gaber had said 
Molloy, not once but several times, and each time with equal in- 
cisiveness, I was compelled to admit that I too should have said 
Molloy and that in saying Mollose I was at fault.Summarization models summary:

And hencefor- 
ward, unmindful of my preferences, I shall force myself to say 
Molloy, like Gaber.That there may have been two different persons 
involved, one my own Mollose, the other the Molloy of the enquiry, 
was a thought which did not so much as cross my mind, and if it 
had I should have driven it away, as one drives away a fly, or a 
hornet.How little one is at one with oneself, good God.I who 
prided myself on being a sensible man, cold as crystal and as free 
from spurious depth.I knew then about Molloy, without however knowing much 
about him.I shall say briefly what little I did know about him.I 
shall also draw attention, in my knowledge of Molloy, to the most 
striking lacunae.He had very little room.His time too was limited.He hastened 
incessantly on, as if in despair, towards extremely close objectives.Now, a prisoner, he hurled himself at I know not what narrow con- 
fines, and now, hunted, he sought refuge near the centre.He panted.He had only to rise up within me for me to be 
filled with panting.Even in open country he seemed to be crashing through jungle.He did not so much walk as charge.In spite of this he advanced114

but slowly.He swayed, to and fro, like a bear.He rolled his head, uttering incomprehensible words.He was massive and hulking, to the point of misshapenness.And, without being black, of a dark colour.He was forever on the move.I had never seen him rest.Occasionally he stopped and glared furiously about him.This was how he came to me, at long intervals.

Then I was 
nothing but uproar, bulk, rage, suffocation, effort unceasing, fren- 
zied and vain.Just the opposite of myself, in fact.It was a change.And when I saw him disappear, • his whole body a vociferation, I 
was almost sorry.What it was all about I had not the slightest idea.I had no clue to his age.As he appeared to me, so I felt he 
must have always appeared and would continue to appear until the 
end, an end indeed which I was hard put to imagine.For being 
unable to conceive what had brought him to such a pass, I was 
no better able to conceive how, left to his own resources, he could 
put an end to it.A natural end seemed unlikely to me, I don’t 
know why.But then my own natural end, and I was resolved 
to have no other, would it not at the same time be his?Modest, 
I had my doubts.And then again, what end is not natural, are 
they not all by the grace of nature, the undeniably good and the 
so-called bad?Idle conjectures.I had no information as to his face.I assumed it was hirsute, 
craggy and grimacing.Nothing justified my doing so.Summarization models summary:

I was initially unaware that there were two Molloys involved, one my own Mollose and the other the Molloy of the enquiry, and I did not consider the possibility of it being two separate individuals.
Despite knowing very little about Mollove, I knew that he was massive and hulking, to the point of misshapenness, of a dark colour, and was forever on the move.
Mollove had a limited time and was moving towards extremely close objectives.
He was a prisoner and sought refuge near the centre of the investigation.
When he disappeared from view, I was filled with a sense of shock, anger, and frustration.

That a man like me, so meticulous and calm in the main, so

back his thoughts within the limits of the calculable so great is 
his horror of fancy, that a man so contrived, for I was a contri- 
vance, should let himself be haunted and possessed by chimeras, 
this ought to have seemed strange to me and been a warning to 
me to have a care, in my own interest.Nothing of the kind.I saw 
it only as the weakness of a solitary, a weakness admittedly to be 
deplored, but which had to be indulged in if I wished to remain a

my hens or to my faith, but no less lucidly.Besides this took up 
very little room in the inenarrable contraption I called my life, 
jeopardised it as little as my dreams and was as soon forgotten.Don’t wait to be hunted to hide, that was always my motto.And 
if I had to tell the story of my life I should not so much as allude 
to these apparitions, and least of all to that of the unfortunate 
Molloy.For his was a poor thing, compared to others.But images of this kind the will cannot revive without doing 
them violence.Much of what they had it takes away, much they 
never had it foists upon them.

And the Molloy I brought to light, 
that memorable August Sunday, was certainly not the true denizen 
of my dark places, for it was not his hour.But so far as the essen- 
tial features were concerned, I was easy in my mind, the like- 
ness was there.And the discrepancy could have been still greater 
for all I cared.For what I was doing I was doing neither for Molloy, 
who mattered nothing to me, nor for myself, of whom I despaired, 
but on behalf of a cause which, while having need of us to be 
accomplished, was in its essence anonymous, and would subsist, 
haunting the minds of men, when its miserable artisans should be 
no more.It will not be said, I think, that I did not take my work 
to heart.But rather, tenderly.Ah those old craftsmen, their race 
is extinct and the mould broken.Two remarks.Between the Molloy T stalked within me thus and the true 
Molloy, after whom I was so soon to be in full cry, over hill and 
dale, the resemblance cannot have been great.I was annexing perhaps already, without my knowing it, to my 
private Molloy, elements of the Molloy described by Gaber.The fact was there were three, no, four Molloys.He that 
inhabited me, my caricature of same, Gaber's and the man of flesh 
and blood somewhere awaiting me.To these I would add Youdi’s

confided to Gaber all he knew, or thought he knew (all one to

of his orders.I will therefore add a fifth Molloy, that of Youdi.116

But would not this fifth Molloy necessarily coincide with the fourth, 
the real one as the saying is, him dogged by his shadow?I would 
have given a lot to know.There were others too, of course.But 
let us leave it at that, if you don’t mind, the party is big enough.And let us not meddle either with the question as to how far these 
five Molloys were constant and how far subject to variation.For 
there was this about Youdi, that he changed his mind with great 
facility.That makes three remarks.I had only anticipated two.The ice thus broken, I felt equal to facing Gaber’s report and 
getting down to the official facts.It seemed as if the enquiry were 
about to start at last.It was then that the sound of a gong, struck with violence, 
filled the house.True enough, it was nine o’clock.I got up, adjusted 
my clothes and hurried down.To give notice that the soup was in, 
nay, that it had begun to coagulate, was always for Martha a little 
triumph and a great satisfaction.For as a rule I was at table, my 
napkin tucked into my collar, crumbling the bread, fiddling with 
the cover, playing with the knife-rest, waiting to be served, a few 
minutes before the appointed hour.

Martha, I said, what is this preparation?She named it.Have I 
had it before?I said.She assured me I had.I then made a joke 
which pleased me enormously, I laughed so much I began to hiccup.It was lost on Martha who stared at me dazedly.Tell him to come 
down, I said at last.What?said Martha.I repeated my phrase.She still looked genuinely perplexed.There are three of us in this 
charming home, I said, you, my son and finally myself.What I said 
was.Tell him to come down.But he’s sick, said Martha.Were he 
dying, I said, down he must come.Anger led me sometimes to

me that all language was an excess of language.Naturally I con- 
fessed them.I was short of sins.Jacques was scarlet in the face.Eat your soup, I said, and tellMOLLOY

for juveniles, having explained its meaning and application to him 
a few days before.So I had high hopes of his telling me he didn’t 
understand.But he was a cunning little fellow, in his way.Martha !I bellowed.She appeared.The sequel, I said.I looked more atten- 
tively out of the window.Not only had the rain stopped, that I 
knew already, but in the west scarves of fine red sheen were mount- 
ing in the sky.I felt them rather than saw them, through my little 
wood.A great joy, it is hardly too much to say, surged over me 
at the sight of so much beauty, so much promise.I turned away 
with a sigh, for the joy inspired by beauty is often not unmixed, 
and saw in front of me what with good reason I had called the 
sequel.Now what have we here?I said.Usually on Sunday evening 
we had the cold remains of a fowl, chicken, duck, goose, turkey, 
I can think of no other fowl, from Saturday evening.I have always 
had great success with my turkeys, they are a better proposition 
than ducks, in my opinion, for rearing purposes.More delicate, 
possibly, but more remunerative, for one who knows and caters 
for their little ways, who likes them in a word and is liked by 
them in return.Shepherd’s pie, said Martha.I tasted it, from the 
dish.And what have you done with yesterday’s bird?I said.Martha’s face took on an expression of triumph.She was waiting 
for this question, that was obvious, she was counting on it.

I 
thought, she said, you ought to eat something hot, before you left.And who told you I was leaving?I said.She went to the door, a 
sure sign she was about to launch a shaft.She could only be in- 
sulting when in flight.I’m not blind, she said.She opened the door.More’s the pity, she said.She closed the door behind her.I l. oked at my son.He had his mouth open and his eyes 
close t Was it you blabbed on us?I said.He pretended not to 
know what I was talking about.Did you tell Martha we were

I let a few minutes 
go by and then, without being uskcd, repeated slowly, word for 
word, this rather long and difficult sentence, which contained 
no fewer than three or four imperatives.As he went out, having 
presumably understood the gist of it, I added jocosely, You know 
which mouth to put it in?I was not averse, in conversation with 
my son, to jests of doubtful taste, in the interests of his education.Those whose pungency he could not fully savour at the time, and 
they must have been many, he could reflect on at his leisure or 
seek in company with his little friends to interpret as best he might.Which was in itself an excellent exercise.And at the same time I 
inclined his young mind towards that most fruitful of dispositions, 
horror of the body and its functions.But I had turned my phrase 
badly, mouth was not the word I should have used.It was while 
examining the shepherd’s pie more narrowly that I had this after- 
thought.I lifted the crust with my spoon and looked inside.I 
probed it with my fork.I called Martha and said.His dog wouldn’t 
touch it.I thought with a smile of my desk which had only six 
drawers in all and for all, three on each side of the space where 
I put my legs.Since your dinner is uneatable, I said, be good 
enough to prepare a packet of sandwiches, with the chicken you 
couldn’t finish.My son came back at last.That’s all the thanks 
you get for having a minute-thermometer.He handed it to me.Did 
you have time to wipe it?I said.

Seeing me squint at the mercury 
he went to the door and switched on the light.How remote Youdi 
was at that instant.Sometimes in the winter, coming home harassed 
and weary after a day of fruitless errands, I would find my slippers 
warming in front of the fire, the uppers turned to the flame.He had

the providential hinderance for which I could not be held res- 
ponsible?Doubtless, but I would never dare invoke it.I was not 
going to expose myself to thunderbolts which might be fatal, simply 
because my son had the gripes.If he fell seriously ill on the way, 
it would be another matter.It was not for nothing I had studied 
the old testament.Have you shat, my child, I said gently.I’ve 
tried, he said.Do you want to, I said.Yes, he said.But nothing 
comes, I said.No, he said.A little wind, I said.Yes, he said.Suddenly I remembered Father Ambrose’s cigar.I lit it.We’ll see 
what we can do, I said, getting up.We went upstairs.I gave him 
an enema, with salt water.He struggled, but not for long.I with- 
drew the nozzle.Try and hold it, I said, don’t stay sitting on the 
pot, lie flat on your stomach.We were in the bathroom.He lay 
down on the tiles, his big fat bottom sticking up.Let it soak well 
in, I said.Summarization models summary:

What a day.I looked at the ash on my cigar.It was firm 
and blue.I sat down on the edge of the bath.The porcelain, the 
mirrors, the chromium, instilled a great peace within me.At least I 
suppose it was they.It wasn’t a great peace in any case.I got up, 
laid down my cigar and brushed my incisors.I also brushed the 
back gums.I looked at myself, puffing out my lips which normally 
recede into my mouth.What do I look like?I said.The sight of 
my moustache, as always, annoyed me.It wasn’t quite right.It 
suited me, without a moustache I was inconceivable.But it 
ought to have suited me better.A slight change in the cut 
would have sufficed.But what change ?Was there too much 
of it, not enough?Now, I said, without ceasing to inspect myself, 
get back on the pot and strain.Was it not rather the colour?A 
noise as of a waste recalled me to less elevated preoccupations.He 
stood up trembling all over.We bent together over the pot which 
at length I took by the handle and tilted from side to side.A few 
fibrou: shreds floated in the yellow liquid.How can you hope to 
shit, i said, when you’ve nothing in your stomach?He protested 
he had had his lunch.You ate nothing, I said.He said no more.I had scored a hit.You forget we are leaving in an hour or so, I 
said.I can’t, he said.So that, I pursued, you will have to eat some- 
thing.

my trousers and examined my knee, flexing and unflexing it.Quick 
the iodex, I said.You’re sitting on it, he said.I stood up and the 
leg of my trousers fell down over my ankle.This inertia of things 
is enough to drive one literally insane.I let out a bellow which must 
have been heard by the Eisner sisters.They stop reading, raise 
their heads, look at each other, listen.Nothing more.Just another 
cry in the night.Two old hands, veined, ringed, seek each other, 
clasp.I pulled up the leg of my trousers again, rolled it in a fury 
round my thigh, raised the lid of the stool, took out the iodex and 
rubbed it into my knee.The knee is full of little loose bones.Let 
it soak well in, said my son.He would pay for that later on.When 
I had finished I put everything back in place, rolled down the leg 
of my trousers, sat down on the stool again and listened.Nothing 
more.Unless you’d like to try a real emetic, I said, as if nothing 
had happened.I’m tired, he said.You go and lie down, I said.I’ll 
bring you something nice and light in bed, you’ll have a little sleep 
and then we’ll leave together.I drew him to me.What do you say 
to that?I said.He said to it.Yes papa.Did he love me then as

sack.I have no idea, I said.Then almost in the same breath, seeing 
her so old, worse than old, ageing, so sad and solitary in her ever- 
lasting corner.There, there, it won’t be long.

And I advised her, 
in terms for me warm, to have a good rest while I was away and 
a good time visiting her friends and receiving them.Stint neither 
tea nor sugar, I said, and if by any chance you should happen to 
need money, apply to Mr Savory.I carried this sudden cordiality 
so far as to shake her by the hand, which she hastily wiped, as 
soon as she grasped my intention, on her apron.When I had 
finished shaking it, that flabby red hand, I did not let it go.But I 
took one finger between the tips of mine, drew it towards me and 
gazed at it.And had I had any tears to shed I should have shed 
them then, in torrents, for hours.She must have wondered if I was 
not on the point of making an attempt on her virtue.I gave her 
back her hand, took the sandwiches and left her.Martha had been a long time in my service.I was often away 
from home.I had never taken leave of her in this way, but always 
offhandedly, even when a prolonged absence was to be feared, 
which was not the case on this occasion.Sometimes I departed 
without a word to her.Before going into my son’s room I went into my own.I still 
had the cigar in my mouth, but the pretty ash had fallen off.I 
reproached myself with this negligence.I dissolved a sleeping-pow- 
der in the milk.He asked for a report, he’ll get his report.I was

had come here to fetch the thermometer.He had been a long time.Had he taken advantage of the opportunity to secure some of his

tray a^c!looked for a few stamps at random, the Togo one mark 
carm!10 with the pretty boat, the Nyassa 1901 ten reis, and several 
others.I was very fond of the Nyassa.It was green and showed a

proved nothing.It only proved that those particular stamps were 
there.I finally decided that to go back on my decision, freely taken122

and clearly stated, would deal a blow to my authority which it was 
in no condition to sustain.I did so with sorrow.My son was al- 
ready sleeping.I woke him.He ate and drank, grimacing with 
disgust.That was all the thanks I got.I waited until the last drop, 
the last crumb, had disappeared.He turned to the wall and I 
tucked him in.I was within a hair’s breadth of kissing him.Neither 
he nor I had uttered a word.We had no further need of words, 
for the time being.Besides my son rarely spoke to me unless I 
spoke to him.And when I did so he answered but lamely and as 
it were with reluctance.And yet with his little friends, when he 
thought I was out of the way, he was incredibly voluble.That my 
presence had the effect of dampening this disposition was far from 
displeasing me.

Not one person in a hundred knows how to be silent 
and listen, no, nor even to conceive what such a thing means.Yet 
only then can you detect, beyond the fatuous clamour, the silence 
of which the universe is made.I desired this advantage for my son.And that he should hold aloof from those who pride themselves 
on their eagle gaze.I had not struggled, toiled, suffered, made good, 
lived like a Hottentot, so that my son should do the same.I tip- 
toed out.I quite enjoyed playing my parts through to the bitter end.Since in this way I shirked the issue, have I to apologise for 
saying so?I let fall this suggestion for what it is worth.And per- 
functorily.For in describing this day I am once more he who suf- 
fered it, who crammed it full of futile anxious life, with no other 
purpose than his own stultification and the means of not doing what 
he had to do.And as then my thoughts would have none of Molloy, 
so tonight my pen.This confession has been preying on my mind 
for some time past.To have made it gives me no relief.I reflected with bitter satisfaction that if my son lay down and 
died by the wayside, it would be none of my doing.To every man 
his own responsibilities.I know of some they do not keep awake.I said.There is something in this house tying my hands.A 
man like me cannot forget, in his evasions, what it is he evades.I 
went down to the garden and moved about in the almost total 
darkness.Summarization models summary:

discard it in the ash-tray, or in the waste-paper basket, later on.But the next day, far from Turdy, I found it in my pocket and 
indeed not without satisfaction.For I was able to get a few more 
puffs out of it.To discover the cold cigar between my teeth, to 
spit it out, to search for it in the dark, to pick it up, to wonder 
what I should do with it, to shake it needlessly and put it in my 
pocket, to conjure up the ash-tray and the waste-paper basket, 
these were merely the principal stages of a sequence which I 
spun out for a quarter of an hour at least.Others concerned 
the dog Zulu, the perfumes Sharpened tenfold by the rain 
and whose sources I amused myself exploring, in my head and 
with my hands, a neighbour’s light, another’s noise, and so on.My son’s window was faintly lit.He liked sleeping with a night-light 
beside him.I sometimes felt it was wrong of me to let him humour 
this weakness.Until quite recently he could not sleep unless he had 
his woolly bear to hug.When he had forgotten the bear (Baby Jack) 
I would forbid the night-light.What would I have done that day 
without my son to distract me?My duty perhaps.

Finding my spirits as low in the garden as in the house, I 
turned to go in, saying to myself it was one of two things, either 
my house had nothing to do with the kind of nothingness in the 
midst of which I stumbled or else the whole of my little property 
was to blame.To adopt this latter hypothesis was to condone what 
I had done and, in advance, what I was to do, pending my depar- 
ture.It brought me a semblance of pardon and a brief moment of 
factitious freedom.I therefore adopted it.From a distance the kitchen had seemed to be in darkness.And in a sense it was.But in another sense it was not.For gluing 
my eyes to the window-pane I discerned a faint reddish glow which 
could not have come from the oven, for I had no oven, but a simple 
gas-stove.An oven if you like, but a gas-oven.That is to say there 
was a ;eal oven too in the kitchen, but out of service.I’m sorry, 
but t.iere it is, in a house without a gas-oven I would not have felt 
easy.In the night, interrupting my prowl, I like to go up to a 
window, lit or unlit, and look into the room, to see what is going 
on.I cover my face with my hands and peer through my fingers.I have terrified more than one neighbour in this way.He rushes124

But the gloaming in the kitchen was of another 
kind and came from the night-light with the red chimney which, 
in Martha’s room, adjoining the kitchen, burned eternally at the 
feet of a litle Virgin carved in wood, hanging on the wall.Weary 
of rocking herself she had gone in and lain down on her bed, leav- 
ing the door of her room open so as to miss none of the sounds 
in the house.But perhaps she had gone to sleep.I went upstairs again.I stopped at my son’s door.I stooped 
and applied my ear to the keyhole.Some apply the eye, I the ear, 
to keyholes.I heard nothing, to my great surprise.For my son slept 
noisily, with open mouth.I took good care not to open the door.For this silence was of a nature to occupy my mind, for some little 
time.I went to my room.It was then the unheard of sight was to be seen of Moran 
making ready to go without knowing where he was going, having 
consulted neither map nor time-table, considered neither itinerary 
nor halt, heedless of the weather outlook, with only the vaguest 
notion of the outfit he would need, the time the expedition was 
likely to take, the money he would require and even the very 
nature of the work to be done and consequently the means to be 
employed.And yet there I was whistling away while I stuffed into 
my haversack a minimum of effects, similar to those I had recom- 
mended to my son.I put on my old pepper-and-salt shooting-suit 
with the knee-breeches, stockings to match and a pair of stout black 
boots.

I bent down, my hands on my buttocks, and looked at my 
legs.Knock-kneed and skeleton thin they made a poor show in 
this accoutrement, unknown locally I may add.But when I left at 
night, for a distant place, I wore it with pleasure, for the sake of 
comfort, though I looked a sight.All I needed was a butterfly-net 
to have vaguely the air of a country schoolmaster on convalescent 
leave.The heavy glittering black boots, which seemed to implore a 
pair of navy-blue serge trousers, gave the finishing blow to this 
get-up which otherwise might have appeared, to the uninformed, an 
example of well-bred bad taste.On my heed, after mature hesita-MOLLOY

tion, I decided to wear my straw boater, yellowed by the rain.It 
had lost its band, which gave it an appearance of inordinate height 
I was tempted to take my black cloak, but finally rejected it in 
favour of a heavy massive-handled winter umbrella.The cloak is 
a serviceable garment and I had more than one.It leaves great 
freedom of movement to the arms and at the same time conceals 
them.And there are times when a cloak is so to speak indispensable.But the umbrella too has great merits.And if it had been winter, or 
even autumn, instead of summer, I might have taken both.I had 
already done so, with most gratifying results.Dressed thus I could hardly hope to pass unseen.I did not 
wish to.Conspicuousness is the A B C of my profession.To call 
forth feelings of pity and indulgence, to be the butt of jeers and 
hilarity, is indispensable.Summarization models summary:

So many vent-holes in the cask of secrets.On condition you cannot feel, nor denigrate, nor laugh.This state 
was mine at will.And then there was night.My son could only embarrass me.He was like a thousand 
other boys of his age and condition.There is something about a 
father that discourages derision.Even grotesque he commands a 
certain respect.And when he is seen out with his young hopeful, 
whose face grows longer and longer and longer with every step, 
then no further work is possible.He is taken for a widower, the 
gaudiest colours are of no avail, rather make things worse, he finds 
himself saddled with a wife long since deceased, in child-bed as 
likely as not.And my antics would be viewed as the harmless 
effect of my widowhood, presumed to have unhinged my mind.I 
boiled with anger at the thought of him who had shackled me 
thus.If he had desired my failure he could not have devised a 
better means to it.If 1 could have reflected with my usual calm 
on the work I was required to do, it would perhaps have seemed 
of a nature more likely to benefit than to suffer by the presence of 
my son.But let us not go back on that.Perhaps I could pass him 
off as my resistant, or a mere nephew.I would forbid him to call 
me papa, or show me any sign of affection, in public, if he did not 
want to get one of those clouts he so dreaded.And if I whistled fitfully while revolving these lugubrious 
thoughts, I suppose it was because I was happy at heart to leave126

my house, my garden, my village, I who usually left them with 
regret.Some people whistle for no reason at all.Not I.And while 
I came and went in my room, tidying up, putting back my clothes 
in the wardrobe and my hats in the boxes from which I had taken 
them the better to make my choice, locking the various drawers, 
while thus employed I had the joyful vision of myself far from 
home, from the familiar faces, from all my sheet-anchors, sitting 
on a milestone in the dark, my legs crossed, one hand on my thigh, 
my elbow in that hand, my chin cupped in the other, my eyes fixed 
on the earth as on a chessboard; coldly hatching my plans, for the 
next day, for the day after, creating time to come.And then I

and locked my door.That at least is clear.Immediately I heard 
a strangling noise.It was my son, sleeping.I woke him.We haven’t 
a moment to lose, I said.Desperately he clung to his sleep.That 
was natural.A few hours’ sleep however deep are not enough for

pulling him first by the arms, then by the hair, he turned away

threw himself down on the floor and rolled about, screaming with 
anger and defiance.The fun was beginning already.This disgust- 
ing exhibition left me no choice but to use my umbrella, holding 
it by the end with both hands.But a word on the subject of my 
boater, before I forget.Two holes were bored in the brim, one on 
either side of course, I had bored them myself, with my little 
gimlet.And in these holes I had secured the ends of an elastic 
long enough to pass under my chin, under my jaws rather, but not 
too long, for it had to hold fast, under my jaws rather.

In this way, 
however great my exertions, my boater stayed in its place, which 
was on my head.Shame on you, I cried, you ill-bred little pig!I would get angry if I were not careful.And anger is a luxury I 
cannot afford.For then I go blind, blood veils my eyes and I hear 
what the great Gustave heard, the benches creaking in the court of 
assizes.Oh it is not without scathe that one is gentle, courteous, 
reasonable, patient, day after day, year after year.I threw down 
my umbrella and ran from the room.On the stairs I met Martha 
coming up, capless, dishevelled, her clothes in disorder.What’s 
going on?she cried.I looked at her.She went back to her kitchen.Trembling I hastened to the shed, seized my axe, went into the 
yard and began hacking madly at an old chopping-block that lay 
there and on which in winter, tranquilly, I split my logs.Finally 
the blade sank into it so deeply that I could not get it out.The 
efforts I made to do so brought me, with exhaustion, calm.I went 
upstairs again.My son was dressing.He was crying.Everybody was 
crying.I helped him put on his knapsack.I told him not to forget 
his raincoat.He began to put it in his knapsack.I told him to carry 
it over his arm, for the moment.It was nearly midnight.I picked 
up my umbrella.Intact.Get on, I said.He went out of the room

The night was fine, in my humble opinion.Scents 
filled the air.The gravel crunched under our feet.No, I said, this 
way.I ent.i'ed the little wood.My son floundered behind me, bump- 
ing into the trees.He did not know how to find his way in the 
dark.He was still young, the words of reproach died on my lips.I stopped.Take my hand, I said.I might have said.Give me your 
hand.I said, Take my hand.Strange.But the path was too narrow128

for us to walk abreast.So I put my hand behind me and my son 
grasped it, gratefully I fancied.So we came to the little wicket-gate.It was locked.I unlocked it and stood aside, to let my son precede 
me.I turned back to look at my house.It was partly hidden by the 
little wood.The roof’s serrated ridge, the single chimney-stack with 
its four flues, stood out faintly against the sky spattered with a 
few dim stars.I offered my face to the black mass of fragrant 
vegetation that was mine and with which I could do as I pleased 
and never be gainsaid.It was full of songbirds, their heads under 
their wings, fearing nothing, for they knew me.My trees, my bushes, 
my flower-beds, my tiny lawns, I used to think I loved them.If I 
sometimes cut a branch, a flower, it was solely for their good, that 
they might increase in strength and happiness.And I never did it 
without a pang.

Indeed if the truth were known, I did not do it 
at all, I got Christy to do it.I grew no vegetables.Not far off was 
the hen-house.When I said I had turkeys, and so on, I lied.All 
I had was a few hens.My grey hen was there, not on the perch with 
the others, but on the ground, in a corner, in the dust, at the mercy 
of the rats.The cock no longer sought her out to tread her angrily.The day was at hand, if she did not take a turn for the better, when 
the other hens would join forces and tear her to pieces, with their 
beaks and claws.All was silent.I have an extremely sensitive ear.Yet I have no ear for music.I could just hear that adorable murmur 
of tiny feet, of quivering feathers and feeble, smothered clucking 
that hen-houses make at night and that dies down long before dawn.How often I had listened to it, entranced, in the evening, saying.Tomorrow I am free.And so I turned again a last time towards 
my little all, before I left it, in the hope of keeping it.In the lane, having locked the wicket-gate, I said to my son.Left.I had long since given up going for walks with my son, though 
I sometimes longed to do so.The least outing with him was torture, 
he lost his way so easily.Yet when alone he seemed to know all the 
short cuts.When I sent him to the grocer’s, or to Mrs Clement’s, 
or even further afield, on the road to V for grain, he was back in 
half the time I would have taken for the journey myself, and with- 
out having run.Summarization models summary:

For I did not want my son to be seen capering 
in the streets like the little hooligans he frequented on the sly.No,MOLLOY
129
I wanted him to walk like his father, with rapid steps, his head 
up, breathing even and economical, his arms swinging, looking 
neither to left nor right, apparently oblivious to everything and in 
reality missing nothing.But with me he invariably took the wrong 
turn, a crossing or a simple corner was all he needed to stray from 
the right road, it of my election.I do not think he did this on 
purpose.But leaving everything to me he did not heed what he 
was doing, or look where he was going, and went on mechanically 
plunged in a kind of dream.It was as though he let himself be 
sucked in out of sight by every opening that offered.So that we had 
got into the habit of taking our walks separately.And the only 
walk we regularly took together was that which led us, every Sun- 
day, from home to church and, mass over, from church to home.Caught up then in the slow tide of the faithful my son was not 
alone with me.But he was part of that docile herd going yet again 
to thank God for his goodness and to implore his mercy and for- 
giveness, and then returning, their souls made easy, to other grati- 
fications.I waited for him to come back, then spoke the words calculated 
to settle this matter once and for all.Get behind me, I said, and 
keep behind me.This solution had its points, from several points 
of view.But was he capable of keeping behind me?

Would not 
the time be bound to come when he would raise his head and find 
himself alone, in a strange place, and when I, waking from my 
reverie, would turn and find him gone?I toyed briefly with the 
idea of attaching him to me by means of a long rope, its two ends 
tied about our waists.There are various ways of attracting attention 
and I was not sure that this was one of the good ones.And he 
might have undone his knots in silence and escaped, leaving me to 
go on my way alone, followed by a long rope trailing in the dust, 
like a burgess of Calais.Until such time as the rope, catching on 
some fixed or heavy object, should stop me dead in my stride.We 
should have needed, not the soft silent rope, but a chain, which was 
not to be dreamt of.And yet I did dream of it, for an instant I 
amused myself dreaming of it, imagining myself in a world less ill 
contrived and wondering how, having nothing more than a simple 
chain, without collar or band or gyves or fetters of any kind, I130
SAMUEL BECKETT
could chain my son to me in such a way as to prevent him from 
ever shaking me off again.It was a simple problem of toils and 
knots and I could have solved it at a pinch.But already I was 
called elsewhere by the image of my son no longer behind me, but 
before me.Thus in the rear I could keep my eye on him and inter- 
vene, at the least false movement he might make.Summarization models summary:

My son often takes wrong turns due to his father's election, which I believe was a result of his father leaving everything to me.
My son was often unaware of the route he was taking and found himself being drawn out of sight by every opening that offered.

But apart from 
having other parts to play, during this expedition, than those of 
keeper and sick-nurse, the prospect was more than I could bear of 
being unable to move a step without having before my eyes my 
son’s sullen, plump body.Come, here !I cried.For on hearing me 
say we were to go to the left he had gone to the left, as if his 
dearest wish was to infuriate me.Slumped over my umbrella, my 
head sunk as beneath a malediction, the fingers of my free hand 
between two slats of the wicket, I no more stirred than if I had 
been of stone.So he came back a second time.I tell you to keep 
behind me and you go before me, I said.It was the summer holidays.His school cap was green with 
initials and a boar’s head, or a deer’s, in gold braid on the front.It 
lay plumb on his big blond skull as precise as a lid on a pot.There 
is something about this strict sit of hats and caps that never fails 
to exasperate me.As for his raincoat, instead of carrying it folded 
over his arm, or flung across his shoulder, as I had told him, he 
had rolled it in a ball and was holding it with both hands, on his 
belly.There he was before me, his big feet splayed, his knees sag- 
ging, his stomach sticking out, his chest sunk, his chin in the air, 
his mouth open, in the attitude of a veritable half-wit.I myself must 
have looked as if only the support of my umbrella and the wicket 
were keeping me from falling.

I managed finally to articulate, Are 
you capable of following me?He did not answer.But I seized his 
thoughts as clearly as if he had spoken them, namely.And you, are 
you capable of leading me?Midnight struck, from the steeple of my 
beloved church.It did not matter.I was gone from home.I sought 
in my mind, where all I need is to be found, what treasured pos- 
session he was likely to have about him.I hope, I said, you have 
not forgotten your scout-knife, we might need it.This knife com- 
prised, apart from the five or six indispensable blades, a cork-screw, 
a tin-opener, a punch, a screw-driver, a claw, a gouge for removingMOLLOY

stones from hooves and I know not what other futilities besides.I had given it to him myself, on the occasion of his first first prize 
for history and geography, subjects which, at the school he at- 
tended, were for obscure reasons regarded as inseparable.The 
veriest dunce when it came to literature and the so-called exact 
sciences, he had no equal for the dates of battles, revolutions, 
restorations and other exploits of the human race, in its slow ascen- 
sion towards the light, and for the configuration of frontiers and 
the heights of mountain peaks.He deserved his scout-knife.Don’t 
tell me you’ve left it behind, I said.Not likely, he said, with pride 
and satisfaction, tapping his pocket.Then give it to me, I said.Naturally he did not answer.Prompt obedience was contrary to 
his habits.Give me that knife !I cried.He gave it to me.Summarization models summary:

What could 
he do, alone with me in the night that tells no tales?It was for his 
own good, to save him from getting lost.For where a scout’s knife 
is, there will his heart be also, unless he can afford to buy another, 
which was not the case with my son.For he never had any money in 
his pocket, not needing it.But every penny he received, and he did 
not receive many, he deposited first in his savings-box, then in the 
savings-bank, where they were entered in a book that remained in 
my possession.He would doubtless at that moment with pleasure 
have cut my throat, with that selfsame knife I was putting so 
placidly in my pocket.But he was still a little on the young side, 
my son, a little on the soft side, for the great deeds of vengeance.But time was on his side and he consoled himself perhaps with that 
thought, foolish though he was.Be that as it may, he kept back 
his tears, for which I was obliged to him.I straightened myself 
and laid my hand on his shoulder, saying, Patience, my child, 
patience.The awful thing in affairs of this kind is that when you 
have the will you do not have the way, and vice versa.But of that 
my unfortunate son could as yet have no suspicion, he must have 
thought that the rage which distorted his features and made him 
tremble would never leave him till the day he could vent it as it 
deserved.And not even then.Yes, he must have felt his soul the 
soul of a pocket Monte Cristo, with whose antics as adumbrated 
in the Schoolboys’ Classics he was needless to say familiar.

indeed I did go, what is more, and my son drew out behind me.I had left, accompanied by my son, in accordance with instructions 
received.I have no intention of relating the various adventures which 
befell us, me and my son, together and singly, before we came to 
the Molloy country.It would be tedious.But that is not what stops 
me.All is tedious, in this relation that is forced upon me.But I 
shall conduct it in my own way, up to a point.And if it has not 
the good fortune to give satisfaction, to my employer, if there are 
passages, that give offence to him and to his colleagues, then so 
much the worse for us all, for them all, for there is no worse for me.That is to say, I have not enough imagination to imagine it.And 
yet I have more than before.And if I submit to this paltry scriven- 
ing which is not of my province, it is for reasons very different from 
those that might be supposed.I am still obeying orders, if you like, 
but no longer out of fear.No, I am still afraid, but simply from 
force of habit.And the voice I listen to needs no Gaber to make 
it heard.For it is within me and exhorts me to continue to the end 
the faithful servant I have always been, of a cause that is not mine, 
and patiently fulfil in all its bitterness my calamitous part, as it was 
my will, when I had a will, that others should.And this with hatred 
in my heart, and scorn, of my master and his designs.Summarization models summary:

Yes, it is 
rather an ambiguous voice and not always easy to follow, in its 
reasonings and decrees.But I follow it none the less, more or less, 
I follow it in this sense, that I know what it means, and in this 
sense, that I do what it tells me.And I do not think there are many 
voices of which as much may be said.And I feel I shall follow 
it from this day forth, no matter what it commands.And when it 
ceases, leaving me in doubt and darkness, I shall wait for it to come 
back, and do nothing, even though the whole world, through the

should enjoin upon me this and that, under pain of unspeakable 
punishments.But this evening, this morning, I have drunk a little

the absurd comforts of my home where all is snug and neat and 
all those things at hand without which I could not bear being a 
man, where my enemies cannot reach me, which it was my life’s 
work to build, to adorn, to perfect, to keep?

I am too old to lose 
all this, and begin again, I am too old!Quiet Moran, quiet.No 
emotion, please.I was saying I would not relate all the vicissitudes of the 
journey from my country to Molloy’s, for the simple reason that 
I do not intend to.And in writing these lines I know in what 
danger I am of offending him whose favour I know 1 should court, 
now more than ever.But I write them all the same, and with a 
firm hand weaving inexorably back and forth and devouring my 
page with the indifference of a shuttle.But some 1 shall relate 
briefly, because that seems to me desirable, and in order to give 
some idea of the methods of my full maturity.But before coming 
to that I shall say what little I knew, on leaving my home, about 
the Molloy country, so different from my own.For it is one of 
the features of this penance that I may not pass over what is over 
and straightway come to the heart of the matter.But that must 
again be unknown to me which is no longer so and that again 
fondly believed which then I fondly believed, at my setting out.And 
if I occasionally break this rule, it is only over details of little im- 
portance.And in the main I observe it.And with such zeal that 
I am far more he who finds than he who tells what he has found,

takes provided it gets him to his destination safely and on time.And perhaps he thinks each journey is the first.This would keep 
hope alive, would it not, hellish hope.Whereas to see yourself 
doing the same thing endlessly over and over again fills you with 
satisfaction.By the Molloy country I mean that narrow region whose ad- 
ministrative limits he had never crossed and presumably never 
would, either because he was forbidden to, or because he had no 
wish to, or of course because of some extraordinary fortuitous con- 
junction.of circumstances.This region was situated in the north, 
I mean in relation to mine, less bleak, and comprised a settlement, 
dignified by some with the name of market-town, by others re- 
garded as no more than- a village, and the surrounding country.This market-town, or village, was, I hasten to say, called Bally, 
and represented, with its dependent lands, a surface area of five 
or six square miles at the most.

In modern countries this is what 
I think is called a commune, or a canton, I forget, but there exists 
with us no abstract and generic term for such territorial subdivisions.And to express them we have another system, of singular beauty 
and simplicity, which consists in saying Bally (since we are talking 
of Bally) when you mean Bally and Ballyba when you mean Bally 
plus its domains and Ballybaba when you mean the domains ex- 
clusive of Bally itself.I myself for example lived, and come to 
think of it still live, in Turdy, hub of Turdyba.And in the evening, 
when I went for a stroll, in the country outside Turdy, to get a 
breath of fresh air, it was the fresh air of Turdybaba that I got, 
and no other.Ballybaba, in spite of its limited range, could boast of a cer- 
tain diversity.Pastures so-called, a little bogland, a few copses and, 
as you neared its confines, undulating and almost smiling aspects, 
as if Ballybaba was glad to go no further.But the principal beauty of this region was a kind of strangled 
creek which the slow grey tides emptied and filled, emptied and 
filled.And the people came flocking from the town, unromantic

But all were 
agreed, like the inhabitants of Blackpool, that their town was on 
the sea.And they had Bally-on-Sea printed on their notepaper.The population of Ballyba was small.I confess this thought 
gave me great satisfaction.The land did not lend itself to cultiva- 
tion.No sooner did a tilth, or a meadow, begin to be sizeable than 
it fell foul of a sacred grove or a stretch of marsh from which 
nothing could be obtained beyond a little inferior turf or scraps 
of bogoak used for making amuldts, paper-knives, napkin-rings, 
rosaries and other knick-knacks.Martha’s madonna, for example, 
came from Ballyba.The pastures, in spite of the torrential rains, 
were exceedingly meagre and strewn with boulders.Here only 
quitchweed grew in abundance, and a curious bitter blue grass fatal 
to cows and horses, though tolerated apparently by the ass, the goat 
and the black sheep.What then was the source of Ballyba’s pros- 
perity?I’ll tell you.No, I’ll tell you nothing.Nothing.That then is a part of what I thought I knew about Ballyba 
when I left home.I wonder if I was not confusing it with some 
other place.Some twenty paces from my wicket-gate the lane skirts the 
graveyard wall.The lane descends, the wall rises, higher and higher.Soon you are faring below the dead.It is there I have my plot in 
perpetuity.As long as the earth endures that spot is mine, in 
theory.Sometimes I went and looked at my grave.

The stone was 
up already.It was a simple Latin cross, white.I wanted to have my 
name put on it, with the here lies and the date of my birth.Then 
all it would have wanted was the date of my death.They would 
not let me.Sometimes I smiled, as if I were dead already.We walked for several days, by sequestered ways.I did not 
want to be seen on the highways.Thf first day I found the butt of Father Ambrose’s cigar.Not 
only had I not thrown it away, in the ash-tray, in the waste-paper 
basket, but I had put it in my pocket, when changing my suit.That 
had happened unbeknown to me.I looked at it in astonishment, 
lit it, took a few puffs, threw it away.This was the outstanding 
event of the first day.136
SAMUEL BECKETT
I showed my son how to use his pocket-compass.This gave 
him great pleasure.He was behaving well, better than I had hoped.On the third day I gave him back his knife.The weather was kind.We easily managed our ten miles a 
day.We slept in the open.Safety first.I showed my son how to make a shelter out of branches.He 
was in the scouts, but knew nothing.Yes, he knew how to make 
a camp fire.At every halt he implored me to let him exercise this 
talent.1 saw no point in doing so.We lived on tinned food which I sent him to get in the villages.He was that much use to me.We drank the water to the streams.All these precautions were assuredly useless.One day in a field 
I saw a farmer I knew.He was coming towards us.Summarization models summary:

seen.Having greeted me, he asked where we were going.It must 
have been his field.I replied that wc were going home.Fortunately 
we had not yet left it far behind.Then he asked me where we had 
been.Perhaps one of his cows had been stolen, or one of his pigs.Out walking, I said.I’d give you a lift and welcome, he said, but 
I won’t be leaving till night.Oh how very unfortunate, I said.If 
you care to wait, he said, you’re very welcome.I declined with 
thanks.Fortunately it was not yet midday.There was nothing 
strange in not wanting to wait till night.Well, safe home, he said.We made a wide detour and turned our faces to the north again.These precautions were doubtless exaggerated.The right thing 
would have been to travel by night and hide during the day, at 
least in the early stages.But the weather was so fine I could not 
bring myself to do it.My pleasure was not my sole consideration, 
but it was a consideration!Such a thing had never happened to 
me before, in the course of my work.And our snail’s pace !I cannot 
have been in a hurry to arrive.I gave fitful thought, while basking in the balm of the warm 
summer days, to Gaber’s instructions.I could not reconstruct them 
to my entire satisfaction.In the night, under the boughs, screened 
from the charms of nature, I devoted myself to this problem.

The 
sounds my son made during his sleep hindered me considerably.MOLLO Y

Sometimes I went out of the shelter and walked up and down, in 
the dark.Or I sat down with my back against a trunk, drew my 
feet up under me, took my legs in my arms and rested my chin 
on my knee.Even in this posture I could throw no light on the 
matter.What was I looking for exactly?It is hard to say.I was 
looking for what was wanting to make Gaber’s statement complete.I felt he must have told me what to do with Molloy once he was 
found.My particular duties never terminated with the running to 
earth.That would have been too easy.But I had always to deal 
with the client in one way or anftther, according to instructions.Such operations took on a multitude of forms, from the most 
vigorous to the most discreet.The Yerk affair, which took me nearly 
three months to conclude successfully, was over on the day I suc- 
ceeded in possessing myself of his tiepin and destroying it.Estab- 
lishing contact was the least important part of my work.I found 
Yerk on the third day.I was never required to prove I had suc- 
ceeded, my word was enough.Youdi must have had some way of 
verifying.Sometimes I was asked for a report.On another occasion my mission consisted in bringing the per- 
son to a certain place at a certain time.A most delicate affair, for 
the person concerned was not a woman.I have never had to deal 
with a woman.I regret it.I don’t think Youdi had much interest 
in them.That reminds me of the old joke about the female soul.Question, Have women a soul?Summarization models summary:

never have believed that — yes, I believe it willingly.Stories, stories.I have not been able to tell them.I shall not be able to tell this one.I could not determine therefore how I was to deal with Molloy, 
once I had found him.

The directions which Gabcr must certainly 
have given me with reference to this had gone clean out of my head.That Is what came of wasting the whole of that Sunday on stupid- 
ities.There was no good my saying, Let me see now, what is the 
usual thing?There were no usual things, in my instructions.Ad- 
mittedly there was one particular operation that recurred from time 
to time, but not often enough to be, with any degree of probability, 
the one I was looking for.But even if it had always figured in my in- 
structions, except on one single occasion, then that single occasion 
would have been enough to tie my hands, I was so scrupulous.I told myself I had better give it no more thought, that the first 
thing to do was to find Molloy, that then I would devise something, 
that there was no hurry, that the thing would come back to me when 
I least expected it and that if, having found Molloy, I still did not 
know what to do with him, I could always manage to get in touch 
with Gaber without Youdi’s knowing.I had his address just as he 
had mine.I would send him a telegram.How deal with M?To give 
me an explicit reply, though in terms if necessary veiled, was not 
beyond his powers.But was there a telegraph in Ballyba?But I 
also told myself, being only human, that the longer I took to find 
Molloy the greater my chances of remembering what I was to do 
with him.And we would have peaceably pursued our way on foot, 
but for the following incident.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
One night, having finally succeeded in falling asleep beside 
my son as usual, I woke with a start, feeling as if I had just been 
dealt a violent blow.It’s all right, I am not going to tell you a 
dream properly so called.It was pitch dark in the shelter.I listened 
attentively without moving.I heard nothing save the snoring and 
gasping of my son.I was about to conclude as usual that it was 
just another bad dream when a fulgurating pain went through myMOLLOY
139
knee.This then was the explanation of my sudden awakening.The sensation could indeed well be compared to that of a blow, 
such as I fancy a horse’s hoof might give.I waited anxiously for 
it to recur, motionless and hardly breathing, and, of course, sweat- 
ing.I acted in a word precisely as one does, if my information 
was correct, at such a juncture.And sure enough the pain did 
recur a few minutes later, but not so bad as the first time, as the 
second rather.Or did it only seem less bad to me because I was 
expecting it?Or because I was getting used to it already?I think 
not.For it recurred again, several*times, and each time less bad 
than the time before, and finally subsided altogether so that I was 
able to get to sleep again more or less reassured.But before getting 
to sleep again I had time to remember that the pain in question 
was not altogether new to me.For I had felt it before, in my bath- 
room, when giving my son his enema.But then it had only attacked 
me once and never recurred, till now.

And I went to sleep again 
wondering, by way of lullaby, whether it had been the same knee 
then as the one which had just excruciated me, or the other.And 
that is a thing I have never been able to determine.And my son 
too, when asked, was incapable of telling me which of my two 
knees I had rubbed in front of him, with iodex, the night we left.And I went to sleep again a little reassured, saying.It’s a touch 
of neuralgia brought on by all the tramping and trudging and the 
chill damp nights, and promising myself to procure a packet of 
thermogene wool, with the pretty demon on the outside, at the first 
opportunity.Such is the rapidity of thought.But there was more 
to come.For waking again towards dawn, this time in consequence 
of a natural need, and with a mild erection, to make things more 
lifelike, I was unable to get up.That is to say I did get up finally 
to be sure, I simply had to, but by dint of what exertions !Unable, 
unable, it’s easy to talk about being unable, whereas in reality 
nothing is more difficult.Because of the will I suppose, which the 
least opposition seems to lash into a fury.And this explains no 
doubt how it was I despaired at first ever bending my leg again 
and then, a little later, through sheer determination, did succeed 
in bending it, slightly.The anchylosis was not total!I am still 
talking about my knee.But was it the same one that had waked140

After falling asleep beside my son, I woke with a start feeling as if I had just been dealt a violent blow, similar to a horse's hoof striking.
I waited anxiously for the pain in my knee to recur, waiting for it to occur, but it did not last long.
The pain recurred several times, each time less bad than the previous one, and eventually subsided enough for me to get back to sleep.
My son was snoring and gasping when I woke up, suggesting that he might have experienced a bad dream.
Despite the pain, I was able to bend my leg and bend it slightly, indicating some degree of strength and determination to get up.

Merging and summarizing: 
It was not 
painful.It simply refused to bend.The pain, having warned me 
several times in vain, had no more to say.That is how I saw it.It would have been impossible for me to kneel, for example, for 
no matter how you kneel you must always bend both knees, unless 
you adopt an attitude frankly grotesque and impossible to main- 
tain for more than a few seconds, I mean with the bad leg stretched 
out before you, like a Caucasian dancer.I examined the bad knee 
in the light of my torch.It was neither red nor swollen.I fiddled 
with the knee-cap.It felt like a' clitoris.All this time my son was 
puffing like a grampus.He had no suspicion of what life could do 
to you.I too was innocent.But I knew it.The sky was that horrible colour which heralds dawn.Things 
steal back into position for the day, take their stand, sham dead.I sat down cautiously, and I must say with a certain curiosity, on 
the ground.Anyone else would have tried to sit down as usual, 
off-handedly.Not I.New as this new cross was I at once found the 
most comfortable way of being crushed.But when you sit down 
on the ground you must sit down tailor-wise, or like a foetus, 
these are so to speak the only possible positions, for a beginner.So that I was not long in letting myself fall back flat on my back.And I was not long either in making the following addition to the 
sum of my knowledge, that when the innumerable attitudes adopted 
unthinkingly by the normal man all are precluded but two or three, 
then these are enhanced.I would have sworn just the opposite, but 
for this experience.

Yes, when you can neither stand nor sit with 
comfort, you take refuge in the horizontal, like a child in its 
mother’s lap.You explore it as never before and find it possessed 
of unsuspected delights.In short it becomes infinite.And if in spite 
of all you come to tire of it in the end, you have only to stand up, 
or indeed sit up, for a few seconds.Such are the advantages of a 
local and painless paralysis.And it would not surprise me if the 
great classical paralysis were to offer analogous and perhaps even 
still more unspeakable satisfactions.To be literally incapable of 
motion at last, that must be something!My mind swoons when I 
think of it.And mute into the bargain !And perhaps as deaf as a 
post!And who knows as blind as a bat!And as likely as not yourMOLLOY
141
memoiy a blank!And just enough brain intact to allow you to 
exult !And to dread death like a regeneration.I considered the problem of what I should do if my leg didnot get better or got worse.I watched, through the branches, thesky sinking.The sky sinks in the morning, this fact has been in- 
sufficiently observed.It stoops, as if to get a better look.Unlessit is the earth that lifts itself up, to be approved, before it sets out.I shall, not expound my reasoning.I could do so easily, so 
easily.Its conclusion made possible the composition of the follow- 
ing passage.Did you have a good night?I said, as soon as my son opened 
his eyes.I could have waked him, but no, I let him wake naturally.Finally he told me he did not feel well.Summarization models summary:

beside the point.Where are we, I said, and what is the nearest 
village?He named it.I knew it, I had been there, it was a small 
town, luck was on our side.I even had a few acquaintances, among 
its inhabitants.What day is it?I said.He specified the day without 
a moment’s hesitation.And he had only just regained conscious-

from him I learned that Condom is on the Baise.Good, I said, off 
you go now to Hole, it’ll take you — I worked it out — at the most 
three hours.He stared at me in astonishment.There, I said, buy 
a bicycle to fit you, second-hand for preference.You can go up to 
five pounds.I gave him five pounds, in ten-shilling notes.It must 
have a very strong carrier, I said, if it isn’t very strong get it 
changed, for a very strong one.I was trying to be clear.I asked 
him if he was pleased.He did not look pleased.I repeated these 
instructions and asked him again if he was pleased.He looked if 
anything stupefied.A consequence perhaps of the great joy he felt.Perhaps he could not believe his ears.Do you understand if noth-

conversation.Tell me what you are to do, I said.It was the only 
way of knowing if he understood.Go to Hole, he said, fifteen miles 
away.Fifteen miles!I cried.Yes, he said.

find one second-hand?I said.You told me second-hand, he said.I remained silent for some time.And if you can’t find one second- 
hand, I said at last, what will you do?You didn’t tell me, he said.What a restful change it is from time to time, a little dialogue.How much money did I give you?I said.He counted the notes.Four pounds ten, he said.Count them again, I said.He counted 
them again.Four pounds ten, he said.Give it to me, I said.He 
gave me the notes and I counted them.Four pounds ten.I gave 
you five, I said.He did not answer, he let the figures speak for 
themselves.Had he stolen ten Shillings and hidden them on his 
person?Empty your pockets, I said.He began to empty them.It 
must not be forgotten that all this time I was lying down.He did 
not know I was ill.Besides I was not ill.I looked vaguely at the 
objects he was spreading out before me.He took them out of his 
pockets one by one, held them delicately between finger and thumb, 
turned them this way and that before my eyes and laid them 
finally on the ground beside me.When a pocket was emptied he 
pulled out its lining and shook it.Then a little cloud of dust arose.I was very soon overcome by the absurdity of this verification.Summarization models summary:

Not that I was exactly ill. And why did I not want him to know I 
was ill?I don’t know.I could have counted the money I had left.But what use would that have been?Did I even know the amount 
I had brought with me?No.To me too I cheerfully applied the

Do you imagine a 
second-hand bicycle costs four pounds ten shillings?I said.I don’t 
know, he said.I did not know either.But that was not the point.What did I tell you exactly?I said.We racked our brains together.Second-hand for preference, I said finally, that’s what I told you.Ah, he said.I am not giving this duet in full.Just the main themes.I didn’t tell you second-hand, I Said, I told you second-hand for 
preference.He had started picking up his things again.Will you 
stop that, I cried, and pay attention to what I am saying.He osten- 
tatiously let fall a big ball of tangled string.The ten shillings were 
perhaps inside it.You see no difference between second-hand and 
second-hand for preference, I said, do you?I looked at my watch.It was ten o’clock.I was only making our ideas more confused.Stop trying to understand, I said, just listen to what I am going 
to say, because I shall not say it twice.He came over to me and 
knelt down.You would have thought I was about to breathe my 
last.Do you know what a new bicycle is?I said.Yes papa, he said.Very well, I said, if you can’t find a second-hand bicycle buy a new 
bicycle.I repeat.I repeated.I who had said I would not repeat.Now tell me what you are to do, I said.I added.Take your face

much money and he so young.And I knew what he was to do in 
that event, namely go and see, or send for, the police-sergeant, 
give his name and say it was I, Jacques Moran, ostensibly at home 
in Turdy, who had sent him to buy a bicycle in Hole.Here 
obviously two distinct operations were involved, the first consist- 
ing in foreseeing the difficulty (before my son woke), the second in 
overcoming it (at the news that Hole was the nearest locality).But 
there was no question of my conveying instructions of such com- 
plexity.But don’t worry, I said, you’ve enough and to spare to buy 
yourself a good bicycle.I added.And bring it back here as fast as 
you can.

You had to allow for everything with my son.He could 
never have guessed what to do with the bicycle once he had it.He 
was capable of hanging about Hole, under God knows what con- 
ditions, waiting for further instructions.He asked me what was 
wrong.I must have winced.I’m sick of the sight of you, I said, 
that’s what’s wrong.And I asked him what he was waiting for.I 
don’t feel well, he said.When he asked me how I was I said noth- 
ing, and when no one asked him anything he announced he was 
not feeling well.Are you not pleased, I said, to have a nice brand- 
new bicycle, all your own?I was decidedly set on hearing him say 
he was pleased.But I regretted my phrase, it could only add to his 
confusion.But perhaps this family chat has lasted long enough.He left the shelter and when I judged he was at a safe distance I 
left it too, painfully.He had gone about twenty paces.Leaning 
nonchalantly against a tree-trunk, my good leg boldly folded across 
the other, I tried to look light-hearted.I hailed him.He turned.I waved my hand.He stared at me an instant, then turned away 
and went on.I shouted his name.He turned again.A lamp!I cried.A good lamp!he did not understand.How could he have under- 
stood, at twenty paces, he who could not understand at one.He 
came back towards me.I waved him away, crying.Go on !Go on !He stopped and stared at me, his head on one side like a parrot, 
utterly bewildered apparently.Summarization models summary: 
Jacques Moran sent his son Sammie Beckett to buy a bicycle in Hole, a fifteen-mile-long distance away.
Sammie Beckett was not aware that the bicycle was intended for him.
The bicycle was for Sammie, not for Goering.
Despite his size, Sammie was nearly his own size, and he had a bicycle carrier.
Jacques had foreseen Sammie would have trouble explaining how he came by so much money and Sammie being so young.
In the event of Sammie not having enough money to buy the bicycle, Jacques gave his name to the police-sergeant and said he was Jacques Moran, ostensibly at home in Turdy, who had sent him to buy it in Hole.
After Sammie returned to Hole, he didn't feel well

understand my son.He must have known he was out of range, 
even of a good stone, and yet he took to his heels.Perhaps he was 
afraid I would run after him.And indeed, I think there is something 
terrifying about the way I run, with my head flung back, my teeth 
clenched, my elbows bent to the full and my knees nearly hitting 
me in the face.And I have often caught faster runners than myself 
thanks to this way of running.They stop and wait for me, rather 
than prolong such a horrible outburst at their heels.As for the 
lamp, we did not need a lamp.Later, when the bicycle had taken 
its place in my son’s life, in the refund of his duties and his inno- 
cent games, then a lamp would be indispensable, to light his way 
in the night.And no doubt it was in anticipation of those happy 
days that I had thought of the lamp and cried out to my son to buy 
a good one, that later on his comings and goings should not be 
hemmed about with darkness and with dangers.

And similarly I 
might have told him to be careful about the bell, to unscrew the 
little cap and examine it well inside, so as to make sure it was a 
good bell and in good working order, before concluding the trans- 
action, and to ring it to hear the ring it made.But we would have 
time enough, later on, to see to all these things.And it would be 
my joy to help my son, when the time came, to fit his bicycle 
with the best lamps, both front and rear, and the best bell and the 
best brakes that money could buy.The day seemed very long.I missed my son!I busied myself 
as best I could.I ate several times.I took advantage of being alone 
at last, with no other witness than God, to masturbate.My son must 
have had the same idea, he must have stopped on the way to 
masturbate.I hope he enjoyed it more than I did.I circled the 
shelter several times, thinking the exercise would benefit my knee.I moved at quite a good speed and without much pain, but I soon 
tired.After ten or eleven steps a great weariness seized hold of my 
leg, a heaviness rather, and I had to stop.It went away at once and 
I was able to go on.I took a little morphine.I asked myself certain 
questions.Why had I not told my son to bring me back something 
for my leg?Why had I hidden my condition from him?Was I 
secretly glad that this had happened to me, perhaps even to the 
point of not wanting to get well?I surrendered myself to the146
