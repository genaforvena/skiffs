I live on a vast and inhospitable expanse, a place where much of my life has ebbed away and I feel no worse there than anywhere else.
In the sand, I was in my element, letting the sand trickle between my fingers, scooping up sand, flinging it in the air by handfuls, rolling in it, and in a cave lit by the beacons

The initial method of transferring the stones was to take three stones from the right jocket of my greatcoat and replace them with the four remaining in the right pocket of my trousers, the four in the left pocket of his trousers, and the four from the left and right pockets of his greatcoat.
This method resulted in the transfer of the stones four by four instead of one by one.


My good leg began to stiffen, causing me to have difficulty sitting on a chair or in an arm-chair.
I needed a prop under the ham and even under the whole length of the leg to support my position.
During this time, I found a solution to the problem of increasing the number of pockets by sacrificing the principle of "trim".

In order for the succession of stones in my mouth to be identical, there are only two options: numbered stones or sixteen pockets.
I decided not to make twelve pockets or number my stones, preferring to make the best of the comparative peace of mind I enjoyed within each cycle.
The only perfect solution would have been the sixteen pockets, sym-metrically disposed, each one with its stone.


I grew up in a wild part of the coast where I was a black speck in a vast stretch of sand.
I kept a few stones but eventually lost or threw away all the stones.
Old women and young ones, including those who gathered wood to gather wood, used to come and stare at the jetsam which was alive and decently if wretchedly clothed.

The noise betrayed me, causing me to turn purple.
The change of colour came mostly at night and was caused by sudden changes of colour.
I was caught up in a series of crises that consumed me, wrung me, and finally threw me away.
My progress was slowed down after the defection of my good leg and I had other weak points that were growing weaker and weaker.


I had an excellent leg and was in the middle of a metamorphosis when my weak points suddenly began to gallop and became literally the weakness of death.
I had hardly left the shore and was far from my mother when these weak points appeared.
My toes were not considered to be vital, apart from a few corns, bunions, ingrowing nails, and a tendency to cr

I am currently at the beginning of my career and do not feel close to the end.
I have a list of weak points that I will never draw up due to fear and fear of being finished.
Despite these fears, I continue to hope for a spurt and wait for the bell to say, "Molloy, one last effort, it's the end."
I can't shake

He has always been inclined to submit to imperatives, even though he knew these imperatives led him away from places where he could have achieved his goals.
The imperatives were explicit, detailed, and detailed, but eventually

I have been going to my mother for most of my life with the intention of establishing a less precarious relationship.
I often left her without doing anything and was on my way to her again when I was no longer with her.
Even without the so-called imperative I impugn, it would have been difficult for me to stay in the forest because I would have had to assume my mother was not
