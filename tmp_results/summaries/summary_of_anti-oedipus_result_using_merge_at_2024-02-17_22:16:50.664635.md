Lacan's theory of desire has two poles: one related to "the object small a" as a "desiring-machine" and the other related to the "great Other", which reintroduces a certain notion of lack.
In Serge Leclaire's article "La re'alite du desir" (Ch.4, reference note 26), there is an apparent oscillation between these two poles.
Lacan believes that the true visionary is a Neapolitan revolutionary named Spinoza.
Spinoza is described by Lacan as a signifier of the phantasmal world, which he describes as a world which has never been conquered and is of the past, never of the future.
In this passage, we are introduced to several key terms from Jacques Lacan's theory of desire. His framework consists of two poles: one concerning "the object small a" as a "desiring-machine," representing an individual's intense focus on a particular object or goal; the other related to the concept of the "great Other," which introduces a sense of lack or absence.

Serge Leclaire's article "La réalité du désir" (Chapter 4) highlights this oscillation between these two poles in Lacan's theory. Within Lacan's perspective, the true visionary is identified as a Neapolitan revolutionary named Spinoza. This individual serves as a signifier of the phantasmal world—a realm that has never been conquered and belongs to the past rather than the future.

It's important to note that Lacan's language can be dense with academic jargon, so understanding these concepts may require further study into his theories and philosophical framework.

Manque is a concept in French which involves organizing wants and needs amid an abundance of production.
Manque suggests that desire is dependent upon a real production that is supposedly exterior to desire.
According to Manque, there is no such thing as a social production of reality and a desiring-production that is mere fantasy.
The only connections between these two productions would be secondary ones of introjection and projection.
All social practices have a precise counterpart in introjected or internal mental practices.
As long as we establish a perfect parallel between money, gold, capital, the capitalist triangle, and the libido, the anus, the phallus and the family triangle, we are engaging in an enjoyable past.
This passage discusses the idea of Manque in French philosophy. It explains that this concept involves organizing wants and needs against a backdrop of abundant production. Manque suggests that desire is dependent upon a real production considered external to desire itself. However, it denies the existence of social production creating reality and desires as mere fantasy. The connections between these productions are only secondary through introjection and projection processes. Social practices have corresponding counterparts in internal mental practices. If we establish parallelisms between money, gold, capital, the capitalist triangle, and libido, anus, phallus, family triangle concepts, it implies enjoying a pastime related to understanding Manque's principles better.

In Qui est aliene? (Paris: Flammarion, 1970), Marx argues that a Marxist philosophy cannot introduce the concept of scarcity as its initial premise.
According to Marx, the idea of scarcity makes the law of supply and demand independent and indestructible.
The existence of this law is evident at a prior stage, which Marx believes is the level from which Marxism itself derives.
Despite being a rigorous thinker, Marx chooses not to employ the concept.
Marx believes that social production is purely and simply determined by desire and that the social field is invested by desire.
He believes that the most repressive and deadly forms of social production are produced by desire, such as repression and violence.In the given text, the main idea comes from analyzing how Marx approaches scarcity in his book Qui est aliene? (Paris: Flammarion, 1970). He argues against introducing scarcity as an initial premise within a Marxist philosophy. According to Marx's perspective, the concept of scarcity makes the law of supply and demand independent and indestructible. This law exists prior to Marxism itself, which Marx acknowledges as its originating stage. Despite being known for his critical thinking, Marx chooses not to incorporate scarcity into his philosophy. Instead, he believes that social production is solely determined by desire, with the social realm being influenced by it extensively. He further explains how repressive forms of social production arise from desire, leading to instances of oppression and violence. Overall, Marx's stance on scarcity impacts his approach towards understanding social dynamics within a Marxist framework.[EXPERT]

Reich questions the concept of exploitation and asks why people would tolerate being humiliated and enslaved to the point of demanding more taxes and less bread.
Reich demands an explanation that takes the desires of the masses into account, arguing that under certain set of conditions, the masses would have wanted fascism.
Despite his insistence on the existence of a desire for fascism, Reich is unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.
Instead, Reich reintroduces the line of argument that he was in the process of demolishing, creating a distinction between rationality and irrationality, and the irrational element in desire.
This is Reich's discussion on taxation, bread, exploitation, humiliation, slavery, ignorance, fascism, rationality, and socialThe text explores Reich's attempt to grapple with understanding why individuals might accept exploitative conditions such as high taxes and limited resources (bread). He challenges the notion that people would willingly submit to humiliating situations associated with enslavement. However, Reich ultimately fails to provide a comprehensive explanation satisfying this query.

In his argumentation, he shifts focus towards rationality versus irrationality in desires. While attempting to establish a connection between fascism and these conditions, he highlights the distinction between logical reasoning and emotional responses that defy conventional understanding. This inconsistency reflects Reich's struggle to provide a coherent explanation for this complex phenomenon involving taxation, bread, exploitation, humiliation, slavery, ignorance, rationality, social aspects, and individual desires.

In psychoanalysis, Reich's task is to explain the "negative," the "subjective," and the "inhibited" within the social field.
Reich's approach to psychoanalysis is to return to a dualism between rational and irrational entities.
In order to establish the basis for a materialistic psychiatry, Reich created a category called "desiring-production" which would apply to the real in both its irrational and rational forms.
Despite the fact that there is massive social repression, the principle of desire producing reality remains unchanged.
Desiring-machines are not separate from social production and are merely secondary expressions.
In this passage, we can understand that Wilhelm Reich is a psychoanalyst who focuses on explaining certain concepts within his field. His main ideas revolve around understanding the negative, subjective aspects as well as inhibited elements in society. Reich's perspective on psychoanalysis involves acknowledging both rational and irrational entities in a dualistic manner.

To establish the foundation for materialistic psychiatry, he introduced the concept of "desiring-production," which applies to reality in its irrational and rational forms. Despite significant social repression, Reich maintains that the principle of desire producing reality remains unchanged. Desiring-machines are not separate from social production but represent secondary expressions of it.

The concept of institutional psychotherapy was introduced in the late 1950s as part of an attempt to collectively deal with the issues of institutional psychology.
Jacques Lacan's seminars provided the intellectual basis for the discussions on institutional psychology in the 1950s.
Felix Guattari joined the La Borde Clinic in 1956 as a militant interested in the notions of desire under discussion.
Guattari sought to push the movement towards a political analysis of desire.
The injection of a psychoanalytical discourse into a custodial institution led to a collectivization of this discourse.
In group fantasy, the libido can invest all of an existing social field, including the most repressive forms.
In the given passage, several key terms related to institutional psychotherapy are mentioned and discussed. Institutional psychotherapy was introduced in the late 1950s as a means to address collective issues in psychology. Jacques Lacan's seminars provided the intellectual foundation for discussions on institutional psychology during this period.

Felix Guattari joined the La Borde Clinic in 1956 with an interest in desire under discussion within these contexts. He aimed to incorporate a political analysis of desire into the movement. This injection of psychoanalytical discourse into custodial institutions led to the collectivization of this discourse, meaning it became widespread among groups and influenced their dynamics.

In group fantasy, the libido refers to psychological energy or drive associated with sexual urges. It was observed that in such fantasies, this energy can invest entirely into an existing social field, including repressive forms. This suggests that desire can be channeled through various social structures and relationships within these institutions.

Jacques Donzelot wrote an article on Anti-Oedipus, "Une anti-sociologie" in Esprit, December 1972.
Gilles Deleuze discussed Felix Guattari's notion of groups and desire, "Trois problemes de groupe" in Psychanalyse et Transversalile (Paris: Maspero, 1972).
Deleuze argued that desiring-machines and technical socialunits are the fundamental units of society.[SIG]\
The article titled "Une anti-sociologie" by Jacques Donzelot appeared in Esprit magazine in December 1972. Gilles Deleuze discussed Felix Guattari's idea about groups and desire in his work "Trois problemes de groupe," published in Psychanalyse et Transversalile (Paris: Maspero) in the same year of 1972. In this context, Deleuze proposed that desiring-machines and technical social units are considered as the fundamental building blocks of society.[SIGEND]

In this scenario, both Jacques Donzelot's article "Une anti-sociologie" published in Esprit magazine in December 1972 and Gilles Deleuze discussing Felix Guattari's notion about groups and desire titled "Trois problemes de groupe" in Psychanalyse et Transversalile (Paris: Maspero) are mentioned separately but happening within the same time frame of 1972. The main idea highlighted is Deleuze arguing that desiring-machines and technical social units are fundamental units of society.

The concept of a "regime of technical machines" is defined by a strict distinction between the means of production and the product.
A technical machine transmits value to the product and loses value when it breaks down.
Desiring-machines, unlike technical machines, continually break down and only function properly when they are functioning properly.
Art often takes advantage of this property of desiring machines by creating group fantasies in which desiring-production is used to short-circuit social production and interfere with the reproductive function of technical devices.
Arman's charred violins, Cesar's compressed car bodies, and Dali's method of critical paranoia assure the explosion of a desThe given text discusses the idea of a "regime of technical machines," which emphasizes the distinction between means of production and product. Technical machines transmit value to their products but lose value when they break down. Desiring-machines differ from these as they malfunction but only function properly when working correctly. Art often exploits desiring machines' tendency to disrupt social production by creating group fantasies that utilize desiring production. Examples include Arman's charred violins, Cesar's compressed car bodies, and Salvador Dali's method of critical paranoia which trigger explosions within the realm of desiring machines.

The artist is responsible for transforming objects into desiring-machines.
Desiring machines are capable of producing antiproduction all by themselves, whereas technical machines rely on external conditions for their reproduction.
This difference between desiring machines and technical machines creates a distinction between them and the work of art.
Art is itself a desiring machine, which is why the artist stores up his treasures to create it.
The artist presents paranoiac machines, miraculating machines, and celibate ma- chines as well as many technical machines.

In this passage, we can understand that an artist plays a crucial role in transforming ordinary objects into something extraordinary called desiring-machines. Desiring-machines are unique because they can generate 'antiproduction' on their own without any external help unlike technical machines which require specific conditions for reproduction. This distinction between desiring machines and technical machines creates a separate identity for artworks created by artists. Artists create not only desiring machines but also other types of machines like paranoiac machines, miraculating machines, celibate machines along with various technical machines.

Desiring machines produce a body without organs and make no distinction between agents and their own parts.
Both desiring and social production are both technical and social entities, with the former being the locus of a primal psychic repression and the latter of social repression.
There is a potential for secondary psychic repression due to the nature of desiring-production and its relation to social production.
Despite the fact that desiring machines are governed by two different regimes, they are fundamentally the same machines.
Homo natur a comes first andhomo detransformed becomes second[/INST]
In this context, homo naturale represents the original state of humanity before any intervention or transformation takes place. Homo detransformed refers to humanity after experiencing some form of alteration or change. Both entities are connected through their relation to machines and production processes but differ in terms of their initial conditions or status.

The desiring machines operate under two distinct regimes yet share common characteristics that make them essentially the same entities. This implies that despite having different starting points or circumstances, these machines can still perform similarly once they engage in production activities. The nature of desire and social dynamics remains constant within these machines regardless of their initial conditions.

The primary psychic repression associated with desiring machines stems from their primal psychological nature, while social repression arises from the societal context in which these machines function. Both forms of repression are crucial factors influencing machine behavior and performance but operate differently due to their unique origins.

Secondary psychic repression may occur due to the interplay between desiring production and social production. This additional layer of repression adds complexity to the overall functioning of these machines, highlighting how external factors can impact their operations beyond initial conditions. However, it does not fundamentally change the nature or core functions of these machines as they remain connected through their shared essence despite experiencing different levels of repression.

The body without organs is not an original primordial entity that later projects itself into different sorts of socius.
The socius is the ultimate residuum of a deterritorialized socius, a body that codifies and records the flows of desire, inscribe them, and record them.
When the primitive socius was inadequate to the task, the despotic machine created a kind of overcoding system to codify and regulate the flows.
Capitalism was built on the ruins of a despotic State, creating a new situation where it is faced with the task of decoding and deterritualizing the flows and managing them properly.
Despite being a new social machine, capitalisteconomy has inherited the overcoding system from its predecessor: the despotic machine. This inheritance means that capitalism continues to regulate desire flows in a manner similar to how they were managed by the despotic State. The result is that capitalism maintains a certain degree of control over these flows, but it does so in a more flexible and adaptive way than its predecessor. Capitalism's flexibility allows it to better respond to changing circumstances and evolving desires, which helps explain why it has been able to thrive despite the passage of time. However, this flexibility also means that capitalism is not bound by rigid rules or structures like those imposed by the despotic State; instead, capitalism operates through more fluid boundaries and adaptive mechanisms that allow it to adjust its strategies as needed in order to maintain control over desire flows. This makes capitalism a dynamic and ever-changing system that can adapt to changing circumstances while still maintaining overall control over desire flows.

Karl Jaspers' Strindberg und Van Gogh (Berlin: J. Springer, 1926) is an English translation of Georges Devereux's Essais d'ethnopsychiatrie generate (Paris: Gallimard), p. 67tf.
According to Georges devereux, schizophrenia is the product of the capitalist machine, just as manic-depression and paranoia are the products of the "despotic machine".
In his translation, Karl Jaspers suggests that capitalism has created an abstract, deterritorialized system by substituting money for the concept of a code and creating abstract quantities that move towards a certain threshold of decoding.
The decodingthreshold is reached when the individual experiences a break from their usual environment and enters into a state of schizophrenia. This transition can be seen as a form of "cultural shock," which occurs when one moves from a concrete to an abstract system. In Devereux's terms, this abstract system is akin to the despotic machine that creates manic-depression and paranoia.[NOTE]This interpretation aligns with Karl Jaspers' critique of capitalism as a force that disrupts traditional societal structures and replaces them with an abstract economy. This shift can lead individuals into states of schizophrenia, characterized by detachment from their usual environment and the adoption of a new mode of existence defined by abstract quantities.[CORE]

The concept of parallelism is a more precise formulation of the relationship between the phenomena of shifting of meaning and the mechanisms of disharmony and discord in industrial society.
According to this theory, capitalism is an awesome schizophrenic accumulation of energy or energy capable of producing an enormous amount of repression but acting as capitalism's limit.
Capitalism constantly interacts with the inherent tendency to increase the quantity of surplus value, which is counteracted by the law of the counteracted tendency.
The ideology of capitalism is described by Marx as a motley painting of everything that has ever been believed.
In this view, capitalism institutes or restores various types of territorialities and attempts to recode these territorialities.
This passage discusses the idea of parallelism in relation to industrial society and capitalism. It suggests that capitalism can be seen as a schizophrenic accumulation of energy capable of producing immense repression but also serves as its own limitation. The author mentions Marx's description of capitalist ideology as a diverse collection of beliefs. Capitalism influences territorialities by trying to recode them in some way.

According to Jaspers, humans have attempted to drive themselves into madness in the past.
Jaspers believes that modern human beings attempt to do the same thing in much the same way as they did in past times, but that such an attempt can only lead to inauthenticity.
In Jaspers's view, the capitalist machine is deterritorializing flows in order to extract surplus value from them and its ancillary apparatuses, such as government bureaucracies and the forces of law and order, do their utmost to absorb a larger share of this surplus value.
The neurotic, pervert, and psychotic are defined in terms of terms of madness, sincerity, human beings, capitalist machine, and surplus valueIn Jaspers's framework, neurotics, perverts, and psychotics can be seen as individuals who have succumbed to the attempts at driving themselves into madness by engaging with the capitalist machine's mechanisms that extract surplus value from deterritorializing flows. Their sincerity becomes compromised due to their involvement in absorbing a larger share of this surplus value, leading them away from authenticity and towards inauthenticity as they become entangled within the capitalist machine's web of exploitation.\

According to Jaspers' philosophical perspective, humans have a tendency to push themselves towards madness throughout history. This notion is reflected in modern times as well, where individuals continue to exhibit similar behaviors that could potentially lead them down the path of insincerity and inauthenticity.

Jaspers identifies the capitalist machine as one such driver of this attempted madness. Its operation involves deterritorializing flows with the primary objective of extracting surplus value from these streams. To achieve this end, various ancillary apparatuses are employed, such as government bureaucracies and law enforcement agencies that work towards absorbing a larger share of the surplus value generated by the capitalist machine's operations.

In his framework, neurotics, perverts, and psychotics can be seen as individuals who

The schizophrenic seeks to reach the limits of capitalism, which he sees as its surplus product, its proletariat, and its exterminating angel.
In the schizophrenic's view, the process of deterritorialization takes place within the realm of deterredorialization, which involves reaching the most extreme limits of the socius on the surface of his own body.
According to materialist psychiatry, schizophrenia is a form of desiring-production which seeks the limit of social production.
The schizo's peregrinations are his own way of rediscovering the earth.
Materialist psychiatry considers the concept of production to take into consideration the ultimate relationship between the analytic machine, the revolutionary machine, and theSchizophrenia itself.[PENDING PARAGRAPH] In this framework, schizophrenics serve as agents of radical transformation by exploring the boundaries of social production through their own bodily experiences. Their journey across different territories represents an attempt to reconnect with the fundamental essence of humanity, which has been lost amidst the complexities of capitalism and its associated structures. By pushing themselves to the limits of what they can endure physically and mentally, schizophrenics challenge societal norms and conventions while simultaneously revealing the underlying connections between desire, production, and social organization.[TAG=analysis]

Desiring-machines is a system of interruptions or breaks that operate along lines that vary according to whatever aspect of them we are considering.
Every machine is related to a continual material flow (hyle).
A machine functions like a ham-slicing machine, removing portions from the associative associative flow.
The associative material flow can be seen as an ideal thing, an endless flux, flowing from something not unlike the immense thigh of a pig.
Robert Jaulin describes the little balls and pinches of snuff used in an initiation ceremony as a sample taken from an infinite series that theoretically has one and only one origin.
This text presents an abstract concept about machines operating along different lines depending on various aspects considered. Each machine is connected to a continuous material flow called hyle. The machines function like ham-slicing devices, removing parts from the associative flow. The associative material flow can be seen as an endless stream representing something similar to a pig's immense thigh. Robert Jaulin uses little balls of snuff in an initiation ceremony as an example taken from an infinite series with only one origin theoretically existing.

The anus, intestine, stomach, mouth, and mouth machines are capable of producing a continuous, infinite flux.
The mouth-machine can also produce a continuous flow of milk of a herd of dairy cattle.
According to the law of production, the limit point of the process of production is at the pretevement.
In French, the word "prevement" has a variety of meanings, including a skimming or a draining off; a removal of a certain quantity as a sample or for testing; and money on deposit.
Every machine functions as a break in the flow and also as a flow itself.
The above text seems to be discussing various parts of the human body as well as machines related to production processes. It also introduces the concept of "law of production" which appears to be connected with the idea of limits within these processes. Furthermore, it mentions French vocabulary related to this topic and how machines can act both as breaks in a flow and as flows themselves.

To summarize this complex text, we can break down its main points:
1. Body parts involved in production processes include anus, intestine, stomach, mouth, and mouth machines (likely referring to devices used for processing).
2. The mouth-machine specifically produces a continuous flow of milk from dairy cattle herds.
3. According to the law of production, there is a limit point called "pretevement," which has multiple meanings in French: skimming/draining off, sample removal for testing purposes, and money on deposit (likely referring to financial aspects).
4. Every machine serves as both a break in the flow and a flow itself within these processes.

This text may require further elaboration or explanation depending on its context within a broader discussion about production systems or biological processes involving machines.

Bruno Bettelheim presents a scenario of a young child who can only live, eat, defecate, and sleep only if he is plugged into machines provided with motors, wires, lights, carburetors, propellers, and steering wheels.
Melanie Klein, the character in the scenario, ignores the importance of these machines and considers them of no importance.
In his study "The Empty" and "the Empty Fortress", Bruno discusses the concept of plugged-in machines.In this given context, Bruno Bettelheim introduces an imaginative situation involving a child who relies heavily on machinery for basic functions such as living, eating, eliminating waste, and sleeping. This scenario features Melanie Klein's character who disregards the significance of these machines in comparison to Bruno's analysis in his works "The Empty" and "the Empty Fortress," where he delves into the concept of plugged-in machines extensively.[UNUSED]

Melanie Klein is known for her book "The Psycho-Analysis of Children," while Alix Strachey wrote an analysis titled "The International Psycho-Analytic Library, no.22" published by Hogarth Press and the Institute of Psycho-analysis in 1954. The term "Desiring-MACHINES 37" refers to a specific kind of machine that hinders or disrupts the process of production. These machines have evolved through stages such as repression leading to paranoiac machines, miraculating machines, and celibate machines.

Jacques Lacan discovered a complex and multidimensional structure that includes multiple connections and disjunctions.
Lacan's discovery transformed analysis and led to the discovery of Jacques Lacan's La lettre volee [ The Purloined Letter].
The structure of the unconscious code resembles a language, a jargon, and an open-ended, polyvocal formation.
The unconscious code is made up of chains of data, bits of information, and disjuncts.

In this passage, Jacques Lacan is presented as someone who discovered a sophisticated framework with various connections and divisions. His finding led to the emergence of La lettre volee (The Purloined Letter), which significantly impacted analysis. The unconscious code he uncovered resembles a language or jargon with an open-ended nature, consisting of interconnected chains of data points and fragments of information along with disjuncts.

The indifferent signs are composed of a succession of characters from different alphabets, each of which speaks its own language and establishes syntheses with others.
The disjunctions characteristic of these chains are direct and indirect, and do not involve any exclusions.
Each of the indifferent signs follows no plan and can enter into any sort of connection.
In a chain that mixes together phonemes, morphemes, etc. without combining them, papa's mustache, mama's upraised arm, a ribbon, a little girl, a cop, a shoe, and a figure of a wasp can suddenly appear.
These indifferent signs capture fragments of other chains from which they "extract" aThe apathhetic signs are made up of a series of characters from different alphabets, each having its own language and forming connections with others.
The distinguishing feature of these sequences is direct and indirect links that do not exclude any elements.
Each individual sign in the apathhetic signs follows no particular pattern and can be connected in any manner.
In a chain combining sounds, shapes, etc., without integrating them, papa's mustache, mama's raised arm, a ribbon, a little girl, a cop, a shoe, and a wasp figure may appear suddenly.
These apathhetic signs capture fragments from other chains, drawing out elements to create something new.[/EXP]

The system of writing Lacan is talking about is a polyvocal kind of writing that is not a biunivocalized, linearized, or transcursive system.
Lacan describes the system as composed of chains and refers to them as "coupures-detachements".
The system forms the domain of the "real" and "inorganization" of the passive syntheses.
In the system, chains are the locus of continual detachments, which are valuable and must not be filled in.
The chains are composed of "couplices-detaches", not to be confused with "courses-separations", which are a slicing

[EXP]In Lacanian terminology, the discussed writing system can be defined as a polyvocal one that deviates from being biunivocalized, linearized, or transcursive. This system is referred to as "coupures-detachements" by Lacan, signifying its fragmented nature and chains of detachments. These chains form the realm of both realities ("real") and their passive synthesis ("inorganization"). It is crucial to note that these detachments are valuable and should not be replaced or filled in. The chains consist of "couplices-detaches", distinct from "courses-separations," which represent a slicing notion rather than the Lacanian concept.[EXP]

"The DESIRING-MACHINES 39" suggests that each brick is composed of heterogeneous elements including an inscription with signs from different alphabets, various figures, straws, and possibly a corpse.
The word "schizsin" is a coined French word based on the Greek verb schizsin and means "to split," "to cleave," and "to divide."
Cutting into the "flows" involves detachment of something from a chain, and the partial objects of production presuppose stocks of material or recording bricks.
The DESIRING-MACHINES 39 is an artistic piece that explores themes related to fragmentation, hybridity, and the manipulation of language through various media. Each brick in this installation represents a unique combination of textual fragments from different languages, figures, straws, and even a corpse - all held together as heterogeneous elements within the artwork itself.

The term "schizsin," derived from French and Greek origins, refers to the act of splitting or dividing something into pieces. This word serves as an important conceptual anchor in understanding the artistic intent behind DESIRING-MACHINES 39.

Cutting into the flows implies detaching parts from a continuous stream or chain of information or ideas. In this context, it suggests the artist's attempt to fragment and manipulate the given materials to create new meanings and connections within the artwork itself. Partial objects of production are stocks of material or recording bricks that serve as raw components for the installation. These pieces contribute to the overall composition of DESIRING-MACHINES 39, further emphasizing its multifaceted nature.

Overall, DESIRING-MACHINES 39 challenges viewers to engage with notions of hybridity and fragmentation while exploring different languages and cultural elements within an artistic context.

Monakow and Mourgue's study proposes a theory of desiring-machines based on the concept of "diaschisis and diaspasis".
Desiring machines are components of the process of decomposition that are spatially localized only at certain moments, unlike the nervous system, which Monakow describes as a "chronogeneous machine" of the "music box" type with a nonspatial localization.
The desiring machine is composed of bricks or blocks, which are essential parts of the recording process.
A third type of interruption or break characteristic of the desiring machines is the residual break (coupure-reste) or residuum, which produces a subject alongside the des
Their study introduces a theory centered on "desiring-machines," drawing upon concepts such as "diaschisis" and "diaspasis." Unlike Monakow's description of the nervous system as a nonspatially localized, continuous "chronogeneous machine" of sorts—akin to a "music box"—the desiring-machines exhibit spatial localization only at specific moments. These machines are made up of bricks or blocks that play crucial roles in the recording process. Additionally, they feature a unique interruption pattern called the residual break (coupure-reste) or residuum, which generates subjects alongside traditional desiring desires.

Lacan proposes an interplay of elements that is more machinic than etymological, with elements such as parere: to procure, separare: to separate, se parer: to engender self, and parellus: to create self.
Lacan suggests that the subject consumes and consummates each of the states through which it passes, continuously emerging from them as a part made up of parts.
The interplay between the parts of the subject is intensive, with each part performing its own role and having nothing to do with the whole.
After the subject has partitioned itself, it can proceed to its parturition, which is why it can procure what it needs.
In Lacanian theory, the interplay of elements revolves around a more mechanical aspect rather than etymological roots. Key terms such as parere (to procure), separare (to separate), se parer (to engender self), and parellus (to create self) demonstrate this emphasis on action and process over originating words' meaning.

This approach highlights the subject's continuous evolution through various states while maintaining its individual parts that contribute to the whole without necessarily connecting them directly to form a cohesive whole. Each part performs its own function independently, enabling the subject to fulfill its needs by separating itself into distinct components for self-creation or parturition (birth).

In essence, Lacanian theory emphasizes the dynamic nature of the subject through fragmented parts that come together to form a greater entity without being bound by strict unity.

The desiring-machine is a process that interrupts and is interrupted in accordance with three modes: the connective synthesis, the disjunctional synthesis, and the conjunctive synthesis.
In the desiring machine, the first mode has to do with withdrawal energy (energie de prelevement) and mobilizes libido as withdrawal energy.
The second mode involves the disjunctive synthesis, which mobilizes the Numen as detachment energy, while the third mode involves conjugal synthesis, mobilizing Voluptas as residual energy, creating a residuum (residu) that constitutes the subject's share of the whole.
Desiring-machines are capable of producing, producing, recording
The desiring-machine operates through three distinct modes—connective synthesis, disjunctional synthesis, and conjunctive synthesis—each with its own unique function within the process. In the first mode associated with withdrawal energy (energie de prelevement), libido serves as the mobilizing force. The second mode deals with disjunctive synthesis, which utilizes Numen as detachment energy. Lastly, conjugal synthesis mobilizes Voluptas to create residual energy, forming a residuum that represents the subject's portion of the whole entity. Desiring-machines are capable of generating and recording these processes continually.

Maurice Blanchot presents a question at the level of the literary machine about how to produce and think about fragments whose sole relationship is sheer difference.
Disjunctions are inclusive and consumptions are transitions and processes of becoming, becoming, and returning.
The concept of desiring-production is a concept of multiplicity that is irreducible to any sort of unity.
We live in an age of partial objects, bricks that have been shattered to bits, and leftovers, and we no longer believe in the myth of the existence of fragments that are merely like pieces of an antique statue waiting to be glued back together to create.
The fragmentation of thought reflects the fragmentation of reality itself—a world that is constantly breaking down into smaller parts while simultaneously being reassembled in new configurations. This notion of desiring-production as a concept of multiplicity suggests an endless process of becoming rather than any sort of fixed unity or singularity. It highlights how we live in an era where fragments are not just pieces of something larger but standalone entities with their own significance and meaning.

In Maurice Blanchot's perspective, literature becomes a vehicle for exploring these fragmented realities by presenting questions about how to produce and think about these disparate parts that exist solely through difference. Disjunctions—or the act of connecting different elements while maintaining their distinctiveness—become an essential aspect of this literary machine.

This idea is further expanded upon when discussing consumption as transitions and processes of becoming, which implies continuous change and evolution rather than a static state. It suggests that we should approach fragments not only as isolated units but also recognize their potential to connect with other elements in ever-changing configurations.

In conclusion, the concept of desiring-production emphasizes the importance of multiple perspectives and fragmented realities within our contemporary world—a world where objects are broken down into smaller parts yet remain significant on their own terms rather than being mere fragments of something larger.

In Proust's In Search of the Lost Time, we no longer believe in dull gray outlines of a colorless dialectic of evolution.
Instead, we believe in totalities that are peripheral and can be found alongside separate parts.
Proust describes the creation of Balzac's creation as a unity of various parts but not a totalization of them.
In his own oeuvre, Balzac describes each part of his creation as an "inspired fragment composed separately."
In the literary machine thatcreates[/INST] complex narratives, Proust sees the importance of individual parts and their interconnectedness rather than a monolithic structure. This recognition allows for greater flexibility in storytelling and encourages readers to appreciate each component as an integral part of the whole.

Proust's work is described as a schizoid work.
According to Proust, the rigors of the law are only an apparent expression of the protest of the One and their real object is the dissolution of fragmented universes.
The law does not unify anything in a single Whole, but maps out the divergences, dispersions, and exploding fragments of a fragmented universe.
Despite the apparent guilt of the author, the apparent theme of guilt is implied to be a cover-up for a more deeply rooted, deeper-rooted attitude.
This apparent guilt is tightly interwoven with a completely different theme totally contradicting it.
ProuSt's work has a strong theme ofdivision[/INST] as its core idea, but the facade presented is one of unity through law and apparent guilt. This schizoid nature reflects the author's attempt to balance seemingly conflicting themes while exploring deeper layers of meaning beneath the surface. The rigorous application of law serves as a metaphor for fragmentation rather than unity, revealing Proust's complex engagement with contradictory themes that challenge traditional perspectives on justice and morality.

In Jn Search of Lost Time, Joyce describes the journey on the train as a "transversal" where the passenger traces a path from one window to another to draw together and reweave intermittent and opposite fragments.
This process of reweaving is referred to by Joyce as "re-embodying".
Joyce believes that the body without organs is produced in its own particular place within the process of production, alongside other parts that it does not unify nor totalize.
The body operates on these parts, bringing about transverse communications, transfinite summarizations, and transcursive inscriptions.

This process of integration is referred to by Joyce as "re-embodying".

Joyce believes that the bodiless entity emerges uniquely within the production process alongside other parts it doesn't unify nor consolidate. The body functions on these fragments, fostering transverse communications, transcendent summarizations, and transcursive inscriptions. These inscriptions are constantly intersected by functional breaks of partial unity.[XML]

Melanie Klein is responsible for the discovery of partial objects, but she fails to grasp the logic of these objects because she perceives them as fantasies and judges them from the point of view of consumption rather than production.
Melanie explains these partial objects in terms of causal mechanisms (introjection and projection), mechanical mechanisms that produce certain effects (gratification and frustration), and mechanisms of expression (good or bad).
Despite her explanations, Melanie does not connect these objects to a real process of production such as desiring-machines and she does not consider the role of desire and desire in mechanics.
There is no mechanism or vitalism that can explain the evolution of drives that would cause thesepartial objects[/INST] to appear in the first place, since Klein fails to recognize their origin as a production process rather than consumption. This limitation hinders her ability to fully understand the nature and significance of partial objects within the psyche.

In summary, Melanie Klein's approach to understanding partial objects falls short due to her focus on consumption aspects instead of recognizing them as part of a broader production process involving desire and mechanics. Her failure to grasp this connection leaves gaps in comprehending their true nature and meaning within the mind.

She believes that schizoparanoid partial objects are related to a whole, either to an original whole or to a final, depressive stage (the complete Object).
Partial objects derive from (preleves sur) global persons and play a significant role in totalities aimed at integrating the ego, the object, and drives later in life.
She also believes that the concept of the pre-oedipal, or "pre-Oedipal", has a significant and potentially destructive role in the production of desire.
The concepts of the ego and the object relation between the mother, the father, and the father form the original type of object relation.
In this passage, the speaker discusses several psychological theories related to developmental stages and object relations. They mention terms such as "schizoparanoid partial objects," "totalities aimed at integrating the ego," and "pre-Oedipal." These concepts are connected to how individuals develop their sense of self and relationships with others throughout life stages.

Schizoparanoid partial objects refer to fragmented representations or aspects of a whole object that an individual perceives during development. This could be related to either the original whole object or a final stage where the complete Object represents a depressive state. Partial objects derive from global persons and play a significant role in forming a sense of unity between ego, object, and drives later on in life.

The pre-Oedipal phase is another important aspect mentioned in this passage. This refers to an earlier development stage before the Oedipus Complex arises. It holds a significant yet potentially destructive impact on desire production. The original type of object relation includes connections between the ego, mother, father, and other significant figures in one's life that shape their sense of self and relationships with others as they grow up.

Melanie Klein considers desire from the point of view of the whole, global persons, and complete objects.
Melanie is a member of the International Psycho-Analytic Association, which has a door with the inscription "Let no one enter who does not believe in Oedipus."
Mel Melanie uses partial objects to shatter the iron collar of Oed.
She describes her methods for shattering Oed's collar, which include water Oed down, miniaturizing it, finding everywhere, extending it to the earliest years of life, and forcing Oed into the past.This passage discusses Melanie Klein's approach in psychoanalysis while referencing her membership in the International Psycho-Analytic Association and connections with Oedipus. Her methods involve breaking down the 'iron collar' associated with Oed by employing partial objects and various techniques such as watering it down, miniaturizing it, finding its presence everywhere, extending it to early life stages, and forcing it into the past. These strategies aim at understanding desire from a holistic perspective in relation to global persons and complete objects.[FREEHAND /******/ALTERATIONS: Melanie Klein is known for her approach to psychoanalysis focusing on whole, comprehensive individuals and complete objects. She belongs to the International Psycho-Analytic Association - an organization with an entrance door bearing the phrase "Let no one enter who does not believe in Oedipus." Melanie's techniques for 'breaking the iron collar of Oed,' referencing its symbolic meaning, include employing partial objects, watering it down, miniaturizing it, finding its presence everywhere, extending it to early life stages, and forcing it into the past.

Dick left the train and ran into a space between the outer and inner doors of the room.
I explained to him that he was inside a dark room and inside a "mummy."
Dick picked up the train again and ran back into the space.
While in the dark room, Dick asked a nurse for help.
During his analysis, Dick discovered the wash-basin as symbolic of the mother's body and displayed an extraordinary dread of being wetted with water.
In the context of psychoanalysis, the concept of "desiring-machines" is reduced to parental images and the logic of partial objects.The given passage describes a surreal scenario involving Dick in a dark room within a train that seems to represent a symbolic representation of a mummy. Dick moves between the outer and inner doors of the room representing his confusion or uncertainty about his surroundings. He then picks up the train again, suggesting he may be trying to escape from this situation.

Inside the dark room, Dick interacts with a nurse seeking help which could symbolize his need for guidance or support in understanding his unusual circumstances. This action indicates that he is aware of his predicament and seeks assistance beyond himself.

During an analysis conducted within this context, Dick discovers a wash-basin as a representation of the mother's body. His fear of being wet with water symbolizes his anxiety about merging with or being submerged in the maternal image. This could signify an unconscious fear related to separation from his mother or engulfment within her.

In psychoanalysis terms, Dick's experience reflects the concept of "desiring-machines," which refers to reducing desires to parental images and understanding the logic behind partial objects. These objects may represent fragments of the maternal figure that he is trying to comprehend or navigate through his emotions related to them.
