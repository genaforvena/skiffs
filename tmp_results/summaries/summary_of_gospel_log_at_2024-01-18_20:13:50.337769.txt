Merging and summarizing: 
And you will perish if you remain in this error and do not follow me.The Jews asked: Who are you?He said: I told you when I first began to teach: I am the son of man, acknowledging the spirit as my Father, and what I have understood from him I tell to the world.When you exalt the son of man in yourselves you will know what I am, because I do and speak not of myself as a man, but what the Father has taught me.He who sent me is always in me and will not leave me, for I do His will.He who keeps to my understanding of life and fulfils the will of the Father will be truly taught by me.To know the truth you must do good to men.He who does harm to men loves the darkness and goes towards it; he who does good to men goes to the light.So to understand my teaching you must do good.He who does good will know the truth; he will be free from evil, from death.For everyone who errs becomes the slave of his error.And as a slave does not always live in his master's house while the master's son does, so a man if he errs in life and becomes the slave of his errors does not live always, but dies.Only he who is in the truth remains always living.To know truth is to be a son and not a slave.If you err, you will be slaves and will die: but if you are in the truth you will be free sons and will live.You say of yourselves that you are sons of Abraham, and that you know the truth.Yet you wish to kill me because you do not understand my teaching.And it comes to this, that I speak what I have understood from my Father while you wish to do what you have understood from your father.They said: Our father is Abraham.Jesus said to them: If you were the sons of Abraham you would do his deeds.

But you wish to kill me because I have told you what I have learnt from God.Abraham did not act like that.You do not serve God, but serve another father.They said to him: We are not bastards, we are all sons of one Father, we are all God's children.And Jesus said to them: If your father were one with me you would love me, for I came forth from the Father; I was not born of myself.You are not children of one Father with me, so you do not understand my words and my understanding of life finds no place in you.If I am of the Father and you are of the same Father, then you cannot wish to kill me.If you wish to kill me, we are not of the same Father.I am from the Father of goodness, God: but you are from the father of evil, the devil.You wish to do the lusts of your father who always was a murderer and a liar with no truth in him.If he, the devil, says anything, he says not what is common to all, but what is his own, and he is the father of lies.So you are servants of the devil and are his children.You see how plainly you are convicted of error.If I err, convict me; but if there is no error in me why do you not believe me?And the Jews began to revile him and to say that he was possessed.He said: I am not possessed.I honour the Father, and you wish to kill me, which shows that you are not my brothers but sons of another father.It is not I who affirm that I am right, but the truth that speaks for me.And so I repeat to you: he who comprehends my teaching and performs it shall not see death.And the Jews said: Now, were we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a devil?You convict yourself!Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
The prophets died, so did Abraham, yet you say that he who fulfills your teaching shall not see death.Abraham died, and will you not die?Or are you greater than Abraham?The Jews discussed what he—Jesus of Galilee—was, whether he was an important or an unimportant prophet, and forgot that he had told them that he said nothing of himself as a man but spoke of the spirit that was within him.And Jesus said: I do not make myself out to be anything.If I spoke of myself, of what I imagine, then all I might say would be of no importance.But there is that source of all things which you call God.It is of that I speak.You have not known, and do not know, the true God.But I know Him and if I said I do not know Him I should be a liar like you.I know Him and know and fulfil His will.Your father Abraham saw and rejoiced at what I understand.The Jews said: You are not yet thirty: how could you be alive in Abraham's day?He replied: Before Abraham existed there was the understanding of good that I tell you of.Then the Jews picked up stones to throw at him, but he escaped.And on the road, Jesus saw a man who had no understanding from the time of his birth.And his pupils asked him: Who is at fault that this man is without understanding since his birth?He, or his parents for not having taught him?And Jesus replied: Neither his parents nor he are at fault.It is God's doing, that there may be light where there was darkness.If I have a teaching, it is the light of the world.And Jesus explained to the ignorant man that he was a son of God in the spirit, and on receiving this teaching the ignorant man was conscious of light.Those who had known him previously did not recognize him.Though resembling what he had been, he had now become another man.

But he said: I am he, and Jesus has shown me that I am a son of God, and the light has reached me, so that now I see what I used not to see.This man was taken to the Orthodox teachers; and it was on a Saturday.The Orthodox asked him how he had come to understand what he had not seen before.He said: I do not know how; I only know that now I understand everything.They said: You do not understand in a godly way, for Jesus did this on a Saturday, and besides, a layman cannot enlighten people.And they began to dispute, and asked the man who had been enlightened: What do you think of Jesus?He said: I think he is a prophet.But the Jews did not believe that he had been ignorant and was now enlightened, so they called his parents and asked them: Is this your son, who has been ignorant since his birth?How is it he has now become enlightened?His parents said: We know that he is our son and that he was ignorant from his birth, but how he has become enlightened we do not know.He is of age, you should ask him.The Orthodox called the man a second time, and said: Pray to our God, the real God.The man who enlightened you is a layman, and is not sent by God.We are sure of that.And the man who had been enlightened said: Whether he is from God or not I do not know.But I know that I used not to see the light and that I see it now.The Orthodox again asked: What did he do to you when he enlightened you?He replied: I have told you already, but you do not believe.If you wish to be his pupils I will tell you again.They began to revile him and said: You are his pupil, but we are the pupils of Moses.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
God Himself spoke to Moses, but we do not even know whence this man is.And the man answered: It is strange that he has enlightened me and yet you do not know whence he is.God does not hear sinners but hears those who honour Him and do His will.It can never be that one who is not from God could enlighten an ignorant man.If he were not from God he could do nothing.The Orthodox were angry at this, and said: You are altogether sunk in delusions and yet you want to teach us.And they drove him away.And Jesus said: My teaching is an awakening to life.He who believes in my teaching, though he die in the flesh, remains living, and everyone who lives and believes in me will not die.And yet a third time Jesus taught the people.He said: Men accept my teaching not because I myself prove it.It is impossible to prove the truth.The truth itself proves all else.But men accept my teaching because there is no other that is native to them and promises life.My teaching is to men like the familiar voice of the shepherd to the sheep, when he comes to them through the door and gathers them to lead them to pasture.No one believes your teaching, for it is foreign to them, and they see your own lusts in it.Men feel with you as sheep do at the sight of someone who does not enter by the door but climbs over the fence: the sheep do not know him, and feel that he is a robber.My teaching is the one true teaching, like the one door for the sheep.All your teachings of the law of Moses are false, as thieves and robbers are to the sheep.He who yields to my teaching will find true life, just as the sheep go forth and find food if they follow the shepherd.A thief only comes to steal, rob, and destroy, but the shepherd comes to give life.And my teaching alone promises to give true life.

There are shepherds for whom the sheep are their life and who are ready to give their life for the sheep.These are the true shepherds.But there are hirelings who care nothing for the sheep, because they are hirelings and the sheep are not theirs.If a wolf comes they abandon the sheep and run away, and the wolf devours them.They are false shepherds.So also there are false teachers who care nothing for the life of people, but true teachers give up their lives for the life of men.I am such a teacher.My teaching is this—to give up one's life for the life of men.No one will take my life from me, but I myself freely give it up for men to receive true life.That commandment I have received from my Father.As my Father knows me so also I know Him, and therefore I lay down my life for men.And my Father loves me because I fulfil His commandment.And all men, not only those here and now, but all men, shall understand my voice; and they will all come together in me and all men shall be one and their teaching one.And the Jews surrounded him and said: What you say is hard to understand and does not agree with our scriptures.Do not torment us, but tell us simply and plainly whether you are the Messiah, who according to our scriptures should come into the world.Jesus answered them: I have already told you who I am, but you do not believe.If you do not believe my words then believe my works; by them you can understand who I am and for what I have come.You do not believe because you do not follow me.He who follows me and does what I say will understand me.And those who understand my teaching and fulfil it, receive true life.My Father has united them with me, and no one can disunite us.I and the Father are one.Summarization models summary:

And the Jews were offended at this and took up stones to kill him.But he said to them: I have shown you many good works and have disclosed the teaching of my Father.For which of these good works do you wish to stone me?They said: Not for your good works do we wish to stone you, but because you, a man, make yourself God.And Jesus replied to them: The same is written in your scriptures where it is said that God Himself said to the wicked rulers: 'Ye are Gods.'If He called even wicked men Gods, why do you consider it blasphemous to call what God in his love has sent into the world, 'the son of God'?Every man in the spirit is a son of God.If I do not live in God's way, then do not believe that I am a son of God.But if I live after God's way then believe by my life that I am with the Father, and understand that the Father is in me and I in Him.And the Jews began to dispute.Some said that he was possessed and others said: A man who is possessed cannot enlighten men.And they did not know what to do with him and could not condemn him.And he again went beyond the Jordan and stayed there.And many believed in his teaching and said that it was true as the teaching of John was.Therefore many believed in it.And Jesus once asked his pupils: Tell me, how do people understand my teaching about the son of God and the son of man?They said: Some understand it like the teaching of John: others like the prophecies of Isaiah: others again say it is like the teaching of Jeremiah.They understand that you are a prophet.And he asked them: But how do you understand my teaching?And Simon Peter said to him: I think your teaching is that you are the chosen son of the God of life.You teach that God is the life within man.

And Jesus said to him: Happy are you, Simon, that you have understood this.No man could disclose it to you: you have understood it because the divine spirit in you has disclosed it to you.Not human understanding and not I by my words have disclosed it to you, but God, my Father, has disclosed it to you directly.And on this is founded the society of men for whom there is no death.LIFE IS NOT TEMPORAL
Therefore true life must be lived in the present.'each day'JESUS said: He who is not prepared to suffer all bodily sufferings and deprivations has not understood me.He who obtains all that is best for his bodily life destroys the true life.But he who sacrifices his bodily life in fulfilling my teaching will receive the true life.And at those words, Peter said to him: See, we have obeyed you, have thrown off all ties and property, and have followed you.What reward shall we receive for this?Jesus said to him: Everyone who has given up home, sisters, brothers, father, mother, wife, children, or lands, for my teaching, shall receive a hundredfold more than sisters, brothers, and fields, and all that is needful in this life, and besides that obtains also life beyond the bounds of time.There are no rewards in the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of heaven is its own aim and reward.In the kingdom of heaven all are equal, there is neither first nor last.For the kingdom of heaven is like this: The master of a house went in the morning to hire labourers for his garden.He hired them at a penny a day, and set them to work.At midday he went again and hired more labourers and sent them to work in his garden; towards evening he hired some more, and sent them to work.And he agreed with them all at a penny.Summarization models summary:

When the time came for payment, the master had them all paid alike: first those who were hired last, and afterwards those who had been hired first.When those who had been hired first saw that those hired last received a penny each, they thought they would receive more, but they also were paid a penny.They took it and said: How is it that the others who worked only one shift and we who worked all four shifts receive the same?That is not fair.But the master came and said: Why are you dissatisfied?Have I wronged you?I have given you what we agreed on.Our agreement was for a penny.Take your pay and go.If I give to these last the same as to you, have I not the right to do what I will with my own?Or are you envious because you see that I am good?In the kingdom of heaven there is no first or last—it is the same for all.After this, two of his pupils, James and John, came to Jesus and said: Teacher, promise us that you will give us what we ask.He said: What do you want?They said: That we may be equal with you.Jesus said to them: You do not know what you are asking.You can live as I do and can cleanse yourselves from the fleshly life like me, but it is not in my power to make you like myself.Each man can by his own efforts enter the kingdom of the Father by submitting to His power and fulfilling His will.On hearing this the other pupils grew angry with the two brothers for having wished to be equal to their teacher, and chiefs among the pupils.But Jesus called them, and said: If you brothers, John and James, have asked me to make you such as I am in order to be chief among my pupils, you made a mistake; and if you, my other pupils, were angry with them for wishing to be above you, then you also made a mistake.

In the world, kings and governors reckon by seniority, that they may rule the people: but among you there can be neither senior nor junior.Among you, to be more than another you must be the servant of all.Among you, let him who wishes to be first consider himself last.For the will of the Father is that the son of man should live not to be served but to serve all and give up his bodily life as a ransom for the life of the spirit.Jesus said to the people: The Father seeks to save that which is perishing.He rejoices over it as a shepherd rejoices when he finds a lost sheep.If one sheep is lost, the shepherd will leave ninety-nine and go to save the lost one.And if a woman loses a penny, she will sweep out the whole hut and seek till she finds it.The Father loves the son and calls him to himself.And he told them another parable showing that they who live according to God's will must not exalt themselves.He said: If you are invited to a dinner, do not seat yourself in a front place, or someone of more importance than you will come and the host will say to you: 'Leave your place and let someone better than yourself have it', and you will be put to shame.Take the lowest place: the host will then find you and call you to a higher one, and you will be honoured.So also in the kingdom of God there is no room for pride.He who exalts himself, by so doing lowers himself; but he who humbles himself and considers himself unworthy, raises himself in the kingdom of God.A man had two sons.The younger son said to his father: Father, give me my share of the property.And the father gave him his share.The younger son took it, went to a far country, squandered it all, and fell into want.Summarization models summary:

In that far country he became a swineherd, and he was so hungry that he ate acorns with the pigs.And he bethought himself of his life, and said: Why did I take my share and leave my father?He had plenty of everything, even his labourers were well fed.But here am I eating the same food as the pigs.I will go to my father, fall at his feet, and say: I have done wrong, father, and am unworthy to be your son.Take me back as a labourer.So he thought, and he went to his father.And as he drew near, his father recognized him at a distance, and ran to meet him and embraced him and began to kiss him.And the son said: Father, I am to blame before you, and am unworthy to be your son.But the father did not even listen, and said to the servants: Bring the best clothes and the best boots, quickly, and put them on him.And go and catch a fatted calf and kill it, and we will rejoice because this son of mine was dead and is now alive, was lost and is now found.Then the elder brother came from the field, and as he drew near he heard sounds of music in the house and called a boy and said: Why are they making merry?And the boy said: Have you not heard that your brother has returned?Your father is glad, and has had the fatted calf killed for joy that his son has come home.But the elder brother was vexed and did not go into the house.His father came out and called him, but he said to his father: Father, I have worked for you for many years, and have never disobeyed your orders, but you never killed a fatted calf for me.My younger brother left home and has squandered all his property with drunkards, and for him you have had a calf killed.

And his father said: You are always with me and all that is mine is yours; you should not be vexed but rejoice that your brother who was dead has become alive again—was lost and is found.A master planted a garden, cultivated it, and did everything to make it yield as much fruit as possible.And he sent labourers into the garden to work there, pay him for it according to agreement, and gather the fruit.(The master is the Father; the garden the world; the labourers men.The Father has sent His son—the son of man—into the world only that men should make return of that—the understanding of life—which He implanted in them.)The time came when the master sent a servant to receive payment.(The Father has always told men that they must fulfil His will.)The labourers drove away the master's servant empty-handed and remained in the garden imagining that it was their own, and that they were settled in it of their own will.(Men reject reminders of the will of God, and continue to live each one for himself, imagining that the purpose of life is to serve the flesh.)Then the master sent, one after another, his chosen ones and finally his son, to remind the labourers of their debt.But they quite lost their reason and imagined that if they killed the master's son, who reminded them that the garden was not theirs, they would be left alone.So they killed him.(People do not like even a reminder of the spirit that lives in them and shows them that it is eternal and that they are not so; and as far as they can they have killed their consciousness of the spirit: they have wrapped the talent in a cloth and buried it.)What then was the master to do?Simply to drive out those labourers and send others.What is the Father to do?Sow until there is fruit.And this He does.Summarization models summary:

Men have not understood and do not understand that the consciousness of the spirit that is in them, and which they hide because it troubles them, brings life to them.They reject the stone on which everything rests.And they who do not take the life of the spirit as their foundation do not enter the kingdom of heaven and do not receive life.To have faith and to receive life it is necessary to understand your position and not expect rewards.Then the pupils said to Jesus: Increase our faith in us; tell us what will make us believe more firmly in the life of the spirit, that we may not regret the life of the flesh.See how much has to be sacrificed, and continually sacrificed, for the life of the spirit.Yet you yourself say that there is no reward.To this Jesus replied: You can readily believe that a great tree grows from a birch seed—if you had as much faith in the seed of the spirit which is within you and whence true life springs, you would not ask me to increase your faith.Faith does not consist in believing something wonderful, but it consists in understanding your position and where salvation lies.If you understand your position you will not expect rewards but will believe in that which has been entrusted to you.When a master returns from the field with his labourers, he does not seat them at table but bids them see to the cattle, and get his supper ready, and only afterwards says to them: Sit down and eat and drink.The master does not thank the labourer for having done what he ought to do.And the labourer, if he understands that he is a labourer, is not offended but does his work believing that he will receive his due.So you too should fulfil the will of the Father and remember that we are unprofitable servants who have only done what we ought to, and not expect rewards but be satisfied that you will receive your due.

You should not be anxious to believe that there will be a reward and life, that cannot be otherwise, but be careful not to destroy this life and do not forget that it is given us that we may bring forth its fruits and fulfil the will of the Father.So be always ready, like servants awaiting a master, to answer him immediately he comes.The servants do not know whether he will come early or late, but they should always be ready.And if they meet their master they have fulfilled his will and it will be well for them.So it is in life.Always, at every minute of the present, you should live the life of the spirit, not thinking of the past or the future and not saying to yourself: then or there I will do this or that.If a master knew when a thief would come, he would not sleep, so you too should never sleep; because for the life of the son of man time is nothing; he lives only in the present and does not know when his life begins or ends.Our life is like the life of a slave whom his master has left to manage his household.It is well for that slave if he always does his master's will.But if he says: The master will not return just yet, and neglects his business, his master will come unexpectedly and drive him out.Do not be downcast, but live always in the present, by the spirit.For the life of the spirit there is no time.Look to it that you do not weigh yourself down with cares, and do not befog yourself with drunkenness or gluttony, and do not let the time for salvation pass.The time for salvation is thrown like a net over all—it is always there.Live therefore always the life of the son of man.We may compare the kingdom of heaven to this: Ten maidens went with lamps to meet a bridegroom.Five of them were wise and five were foolish.Summarization models summary:

The foolish ones took lamps without any extra oil, but the wise ones took lamps and a supply of oil.While they waited for the bridegroom they went to sleep.When the bridegroom was approaching the foolish maidens saw that they had too little oil and went to buy some, but while they were gone the bridegroom came.And the wise maidens who had oil went in with him and the doors were shut.Their business was only this: to meet the bridegroom with lights.But the foolish ones had forgotten that it was important not only that the lights should burn, but that they should burn at the proper time.And in order that they should be alight when the bridegroom came, it was necessary that they should burn all the time.Life is only for this: to exalt the son of man, and the son of man is always here, he does not belong to some particular time, and so to serve him one must live without time—in the present alone.Therefore strive to enter into the life of the spirit now.If you do not make efforts you will not enter it.You will say: We said so and so.But there will be no good works to show, and there will be no life.For the son of man—the one true spirit of life—will appear in each man according to his deeds.Mankind is divided according to the way men serve the son of man.And by their works men will be separated into two groups, as sheep from goats in a flock.The one will live, the other will perish.They who have served the son of man will receive what has been theirs from the beginning of the world—the life which they have preserved.They have preserved life by serving the son of man.They have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, welcomed strangers, visited those in prison.They have lived by the son of man, felt that he is the same in all men, and have therefore loved their neighbours.

Those who have not lived by the son of man, have not served him, have not understood that he is the same in all men and have therefore not united with him, have lost the life they had in him and have perished.TEMPTATIONS
The deceptions of temporal life hide from men the true life in the present.'and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors'SOME children were brought to Jesus, and he saw that his pupils were sending them away.He was grieved at this.and said: It is wrong to send children away.They are better than anyone, for they live according to the will of the Father: they are indeed in the kingdom of heaven.Instead of sending them away you should learn from them, for to live in the Father's will you must live as children do.They do not abuse people, do not bear ill-will, do not lust, do not bind themselves by oaths, do not resist evil, do not go to law with anyone, acknowledge no difference between their own and other nations; and so they are better than grown-up people and are in the kingdom of heaven.If you do not become as children and refrain from all the snares of the flesh, you will not be in the kingdom of heaven.Only he understands my teaching who recognizes that children are better than we, because they do not infringe the Father's will.Only he who understands my teaching understands the will of the Father.We must not despise children.They are better than we, and their hearts are always with the Father and are pure in his sight.Not one child perishes by the Father's will.They perish only because men entice them and draw them away from the truth.Be careful therefore not to lead a child away from the Father and from true life; for he who leads a child away from purity does evil.Summarization models summary:

To lead a child away from goodness, to tempt him, is as bad as to hang a millstone about his neck and throw him into the water.It is hard for him to get out, and he is more likely to drown.Equally hard is it for a child to escape from the temptations into which a grown-up man leads him.The world of men is unhappy only because of temptations.Temptations are everywhere in the world; they always were and always will be, and man perishes on account of them.So give up everything, sacrifice everything, in order to avoid falling into temptation.If a fox is caught in a trap it will wrench off its paw to escape, and the paw will heal and the fox remain alive.You too should be ready to give up everything in order not to sink into temptation.Beware of the temptation to break the first commandment: not to be angry with people when they injure you and you wish for revenge.If a man has injured you do not forget that he is a son of the same Father and is your brother.If he has offended you go and appeal to his conscience face to face.If he listens to you, you are a gainer and have found a new brother.If he does not listen to you, take two or three others with you to persuade him, and if he repents forgive him.Forgive him always, even if he offends you seven times and seven times asks for forgiveness.If he will not listen to you then tell the congregation of those who believe in my teaching, and if he will not listen to them, still forgive him, and have nothing more to do with him.For the Kingdom of God may be compared to this: A king began to settle with his vassals.And they brought to him a man who owed him a million and had nothing to pay with.

And the king would have had to sell the vassal's land, his wife, his children, and the man himself.But the vassal begged mercy of the king, and the king had mercy on him and forgave him all his debt.Now this same man went home and saw a peasant who owed him fifty pence.And he seized the peasant and began to throttle him, and said: Pay what you owe me.And the peasant fell at his feet and said: Have patience with me and I will pay you all.But the other showed him no mercy and put him in prison, to stay there till he paid everything.Other peasants saw this and went to the king and told what the vassal had done.Then the king called the vassal and said to him: Wretched man, I forgave you all your debt because you begged me to, and you should have forgiven your debtor as I forgave you.And the king was angry and handed the vassal over to be tortured till his whole debt should be paid.And the Father will deal with you in like manner if you do not with your whole heart forgive all those who are to blame in your sight.You know that if you have a quarrel with a man, it is better to make it up with him without going to law.You know that, and act accordingly, because you know that if you go to law you will lose more.So it is with all anger.If you know that anger is an evil thing and separates you from the Father, then get rid of the anger as quickly as possible and make peace.You know that as you become bound on earth, so will you be bound before the Father.And as you free yourselves on earth so you will also be free before the Father.Understand that if two or three are united on earth in my teaching, all that they desire they already have from my Father.Summarization models summary:

Because where two or three are joined together in the name of the spirit in man, that spirit of man already lives in them.Beware also of temptation under the second commandment: about men changing their wives.Some Orthodox teachers once came to Jesus, and trying him, said: May a man put away his wife?He answered: From the very beginning man was created male and female: that was the Father's will.Therefore a man leaves father and mother and cleaves to his wife, and the husband and wife unite in one body.So that his wife is for a man the same as his own flesh.Therefore a man must not break the natural law of God and divide what is united.In your law of Moses it is said that you may put away your wife and take another, but that is wrong.According to the Father's will it is not so.And I tell you that he who casts off his wife drives both her and him who unites with her into depravity.And by casting off his wife a man spreads dissoluteness abroad.And his pupils said to Jesus: It is too hard to be always bound to one wife.If that must be, it would be better not to marry at all.He said to them: You may refrain from marriage but you must understand what that means.If a man wishes to live without a wife, let him be quite pure and not approach women: but let him who loves women unite with one wife and not cast her off or look at other women.Beware of temptation against the third commandment: about being forced to fulfil obligations as a result of taking oaths.The tax-collectors once came to Peter and asked him: What about your teacher—does he pay the tax?Peter said: No, he does not.And he went and told Jesus that the tax-collectors had stopped him and had said that everyone was bound to pay the taxes.

Then Jesus said to him: A king does not take taxes from his sons, nor do they have to pay them to anyone else.Is that not so?So it is with us.If we are sons of God we are bound to no one but God, and are free from all obligations.But if they demand the tax from you, then pay: not that you are under obligation to do so but because you must not resist evil.Otherwise resistance to evil will produce worse evil.Another time the Orthodox together with Caesar's officials went to Jesus to entrap him in his words.They said to him: You teach everyone according to the truth.Tell us, then, are we bound to pay taxes to Caesar or not?Jesus understood that they wished to convict him of not acknowledging the duty to Caesar.And he said to them: Show me what the taxes to Caesar are paid with.They handed him a coin.He looked at it and said: What is this on it?Whose is this image and inscription?They said: Caesar's.And he said: Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar's, but that which is God's—your soul—give to no one but God.Money, property, your labour, give to him who asks them of you.But give your soul to no one but God.Your Orthodox teachers go about everywhere making people swear and vow that they will fulfil the law.But by this they only pervert people and make them worse than before.It is impossible to let the body put the soul under obligation.In your soul, God is; and you cannot make promises on God's behalf to other men.Beware of the temptation to break the fourth commandment—about judging and executing people and calling on others to take part in these judgements and executions.The pupils of Jesus once went into a village and asked for a night's lodging but were not admitted.Then they went to Jesus to complain, and said: Let lightning destroy these people!Summarization models summary:

Jesus answered: You still do not understand of what spirit you are.I do not teach to destroy people but to save them.Once a man came to Jesus and said: Bid my brother give me my inheritance.Jesus said to him: No one has made me a judge over you, and I judge no one.Neither may you sentence anyone.The Orthodox once brought a woman to Jesus and said: See, this woman was taken in adultery.Now by the law she should be stoned to death, but what do you say about it?Jesus answered nothing, and waited for them to bethink themselves.But they pressed him, and asked him what he would adjudge to this woman?Then he said: Let him among you who has no fault cast the first stone at her.And he said nothing more.Then the Orthodox looked within themselves and their conscience smote them, and those in front drew behind the others and they all went away.Jesus remained alone with the woman.He looked round, saw that there was no one else, and said to her: Has no one condemned you?She said: No one!Then he said: Neither do I condemn you.Go, and in future do not sin.Beware!The temptation against the fifth commandment is for men to consider it their duty to do good to their fellow-countrymen only and to regard other nations as enemies.A teacher of the law wished to try Jesus and said to him: What must I do to obtain life?Jesus replied: You yourself know what to do: love your Father, God, and your brothers, His sons, whether they are your fellow-countrymen or not.And the teacher of the law said: That would be well if there were not different nations, but how am I to love an enemy of my own people?And Jesus said: There was a Jew who fell into misfortune.He was beaten, robbed, and left on the road.

A Jewish priest passed by, looked at the injured man and went on.Then a Jewish Levite passed, looked at the injured man and also passed by.Then there came a man of another, a hostile nation, a Samaritan.This Samaritan saw the Jew and pitied him, not thinking of the Jews' contempt for the Samaritans.He washed and bound up his wounds, took him on his own ass to an inn, paid money for him to the innkeeper and promised to call again and pay for him.See that you too behave like that to foreigners and to those who despise and ruin you.Then you will obtain true life.Jesus said: The world loves its own but hates God's people.Therefore men of the world—priests, preachers, officials—will harass those who fulfil the Father's will.I am going to Jerusalem and they will torture and kill me, but my spirit cannot be killed and will remain alive.Having heard that Jesus would be tortured and killed in Jerusalem, Peter was sad and took Jesus by the hand and said to him: If that is so, you had better not go to Jerusalem.Then Jesus said to Peter: Do not say that.What you say is a temptation.If you fear tortures and death for me it means that you are not thinking of what is godly—of the spirit—but are thinking of what is human.And having called the people and his pupils to him Jesus said: He that wishes to live according to my teaching let him forsake his fleshly life and be ready for all physical sufferings: he who fears for his physical life will ruin his true life, but he who disregards his fleshly life will save his true life.But they did not understand this, and then some materialists came, and he explained to all what true life and the awakening from death means.These materialists believed that after the death of the body there is no other life.They said: How can anybody rise from the dead?Summarization models summary:

If everybody rose, they could not live together.For instance, there were seven brothers among us.The first married and died.His wife married the second brother, and he died; and she then married the third, who also died, and so on to the seventh.Now how can those seven brothers all live with one wife if they all rise from the dead?Jesus answered them: Either you purposely confuse things or you do not understand what the awakening to life is.In this life people marry.But those who earn everlasting life and awaken from death do not marry and cannot die, for they are united to the Father.In your scriptures it is written that God said: I am the God of Abraham and Jacob.And this was said when Abraham and Jacob had died from among men.So those who are dead from among men are alive to God.If God is, and God does not die, then they who are with God live always.The awakening from death is to live in the will of the Father.For the Father there is no time, and therefore by fulfilling the Father's will and uniting with him man departs from time and death.When they heard this the Orthodox did not know what to devise to silence Jesus, and together they began to question him.And one of them said:Teacher, which in your opinion is the chief commandment of the whole law?They thought that Jesus would get confused in answering about the law.But Jesus said: The chief commandment is that you should love with all your soul the Lord your God in whose power you are.And the other commandment to love your neighbour follows from it, for the same Lord God is in him also.In this is the substance of all that is written in your scriptures.And he said further: What in your opinion is Christ?Is he someone's son?They said: In our opinion Christ is the son of David.He replied: How then is it that David calls Christ his Lord?

Christ is neither David's son, nor anyone's son after the flesh, but Christ is that same Lord, our Ruler, whom we know in ourselves as our life.Christ is that consciousness which is within us.And Jesus said: Beware of the leaven of the Orthodox teachers.Beware also of the leaven of the materialists and of the rulers.But most of all, beware of the leaven of the self-styled 'Orthodox', for in them is the chief stumbling-block.And when the people understood what he was speaking about, he repeated:Most of all, beware of the teaching of the scholars, the self-styled Orthodox.Beware of them, because they occupy the place of the prophets who declared the will of God to the people.They have of themselves assumed the authority to preach the will of God to the people.They preach words, but do nothing.They only say: Do this and do that.But there is nothing to do, because they do nothing good, but only talk.They tell people to do what cannot be done, and they themselves do nothing.They only try to keep the teaching in their own hands, and for that purpose strive to appear imposing; they dress themselves up and exalt themselves.Know therefore that no one should call himself a teacher and leader.The self-appointed Orthodox call themselves teachers, and by so doing hinder you from entering into the kingdom of heaven, and do not enter it themselves.These Orthodox think that people can be brought to God by external ceremonies and pledges.Like blind men they do not see that the outside show is of no importance and that everything depends on the soul.They themselves do what is easy and external, but what is needful and difficult—love, mercy, and truth—they neglect.They only wish to appear to be within the law and to bring others outwardly to the law.Therefore they are like painted tombs, which seem clean externally but are loathsome within.Summarization models summary:

They outwardly honour the holy martyrs, but in fact they are just the people who torture and kill the saints.They were, and are, the enemies of all that is good.All the evil in the world comes of them, because they hide the good and put forward evil in its stead.Most of all to be feared, therefore, are the self-appointed teachers.You yourselves know that every other mistake may be corrected, but if people are mistaken as to what is good it cannot be corrected, and that is the case with the self-appointed leaders.And Jesus said: I wished here in Jerusalem to unite all men in one understanding of true happiness, but the people here are only capable of putting the teachers of goodness to death.Therefore they will remain as godless as they were, and will not know the true God till they lovingly accept the understanding of Him.And Jesus went away from the temple.Then his pupils said to him: But what will happen to the temple of God, with all the embellishments people have brought to it to give to God?And Jesus said: I tell you truly that this whole temple with all its embellishments will be destroyed, and nothing will be left of it.There is only one true temple of God—the hearts of men when they love one another.And they asked him: When will that temple be?And Jesus said to them: It will not be yet.People will for a long time be deceived in the name of my teaching, and this will cause wars and rebellions.There will be much wrong-doing and little love.But when the true teaching spreads abroad among all men, then there will be an end of evil and temptations.THE STRUGGLE WITH TEMPTATION
So, not to fall into temptation, we must at every moment of our life be at one with the Father.'and lead us not into temptation'

AFTER this, the Orthodox chief priests tried to do all they could to ensnare Jesus, so as in one way or other to destroy him.They assembled in council and began to consider.They said: We must somehow finish with this man.He so proves his teaching that if we let him alone everyone will believe in him and cast off our belief.Now already half the people believe in him.But if the Jews come to believe his teaching that all men are sons of one Father and are brothers, and that our Hebrew people are not different from others, then the Romans will overwhelm us completely and we shall no longer have a Hebrew kingdom.And the Orthodox chief priests and scholars long consulted together and could not decide what to do with him, for they could not make up their minds to kill him.Then one of them, Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year, said to them: You must remember that it is expedient to kill one man rather than let the whole people perish, and if we leave this man alone the people will perish.I warn you of that, so it is better to kill Jesus.Even if the people did not perish, still they will be scattered and will go astray from the one faith unless we kill this man.So it is better to kill him.And when Caiaphas said this they all agreed not to hesitate, but that it was necessary to kill Jesus without fail.They would at once have taken him and killed him, but he withdrew from them into the desert.But just then the feast of the Passover occurred, when many people assembled in Jerusalem for the holiday; and the Orthodox chief priests counted on Jesus coming with the people to the feast.So they made known to the people that if anyone saw Jesus he should bring him to them.And it so happened that six days before the Passover Jesus said to his pupils: Let us go to Jerusalem.But the pupils said to him: Do not go.Summarization models summary:

The chief priests have resolved to stone you to death.If you go there they will kill you.Jesus said to them: I cannot fear anything because I live in the light of understanding.And as every man, that he may not stumble, walks by day and not by night, so every man, that he may not doubt or fear, must live by this understanding.Only that man doubts and fears who lives by the flesh; he who lives by understanding neither doubts nor fears anything.And Jesus came to the village of Bethany near Jerusalem, to the house of Martha and Mary.And when he sat at supper Martha waited on him.But Mary took a pound of fresh scented oil, poured it over his feet and wiped them with her hair.When the scent of the oil had filled the whole room, Judas Iscariot said: Mary was wrong to waste this expensive oil; it would have been better to sell it for three hundred pence and give it to the poor.But Jesus said: You will have the poor always with you, but I shall soon have gone away.She has done well!She has prepared my body for its burial.In the morning Jesus went to Jerusalem where many people had come for the feast, and when they recognized Jesus they surrounded him, tore branches from the trees, and threw down their clothes on the road before him, and all shouted: He is our true King, he has taught us to know the true God.Jesus rode on an ass's foal, and the people ran before him and shouted.So he entered Jerusalem.And when he had ridden thus into the town all the people were excited and asked: Who is he?And those who knew him answered: Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth in Galilee.And Jesus went into the temple and again drove out thence all the buyers and sellers.When the Orthodox chief priests saw all this they said to each other: See what this man is doing.All the people follow him.

And they dared not take him straight from among the people, because they saw that the people were on his side, and they considered how to take him by cunning.Meanwhile Jesus was in the temple and taught the people, among whom besides the Jews there were Greeks who were heathen.The Greeks had heard of Jesus's teaching and understood that he taught the truth not only to Hebrews but to all men; so they also wished to be his pupils and spoke about this to Philip.And Philip told it to Andrew.These two feared to bring Jesus and the Greeks together.They feared that the people would be angry with Jesus for not making any difference between the Hebrews and other nations, and they long hesitated about telling him.Afterwards they told him both together, and hearing that the Greeks wished to be his pupils Jesus was troubled.He knew that the people would hate him for making no difference between Hebrews and heathen, and yet he acknowledged himself to be one with the heathen.He said: The time is come to explain what I understand by the son of man.And though I perish in explaining this, because I destroy the distinction between Jews and heathen, I will still speak the truth.A grain of wheat only fructifies when it itself perishes.He who loves his fleshly life loses the true life, but he who disregards the life of the flesh preserves the life everlasting.Let him who wishes to follow my teaching do as I do.And he who does as I do shall be rewarded by my Father.My soul is now troubled: shall I yield to consideration for my temporal life, or fulfil the will of the Father now at this hour?Can it be that now, when the hour in which I live has come, I shall say: Father, deliver me from that which I ought to do?I cannot say that, for I now live.Therefore I say: Father, show Thyself in me.Summarization models summary:

And Jesus said: Henceforth the present society of men is doomed to destruction.From this time that which rules this world shall be destroyed.And when the son of man is exalted above the earthly life he will unite all in one.Then the Jews said to him: We understand from the scriptures that there is an eternal Christ.How then do you say that the son of man shall be exalted?What does it mean—to exalt the son of man?To this Jesus replied: To exalt the son of man means to live by the light of understanding that is in you.To exalt the son of man above the earthly life means to believe in the light while there is light, in order to be a son of understanding.He who believes in my teaching believes not in me but in that spirit which gave life to the world.And he who understands my teaching understands that spirit which gave life to the world.If anyone hears my words and does not fulfil them, it is not I who blame him, for I came not to accuse but to save.He who does not accept my teaching is accused, not by my teaching but by the understanding which is in himself.It is that which accuses him.I do not speak of myself, but say what my Father—the living spirit within me—suggests to me.That which I say has been told me by the spirit of understanding, and that which I teach is the true life.Having said this, Jesus went away and again hid from the chief priests.And among those who heard these words of Jesus were many powerful and wealthy people who believed his teaching but were afraid to acknowledge it to the chief priests.Not one of the chief priests acknowledged that he believed the teaching, for they were accustomed to judge by human standards and not by God's.After Jesus had hidden himself, the chief priests and elders again gathered together at the palace of Caiaphas.

And they began to plan how to take Jesus unknown to the people, for they were afraid to take him openly.And one of the first twelve pupils of Jesus, Judas Iscariot, came to their council and said: If you want to take Jesus secretly so that the people may not see it, I will find a time when there will be few people with him, and will show you where he is and then you can take him.But what will you give me for that?They promised him thirty pieces of silver.He agreed; and from that time began to seek opportunity to lead the chief priests upon Jesus to take him.Meanwhile Jesus withdrew from the people and only his pupils were with him.When the first feast of unleavened bread was at hand the pupils said to Jesus: Where shall we keep the Passover?And Jesus said: Go into the village, enter a house, say that you have not had time to prepare for the feast, and ask the man who lives there to admit us to celebrate the Passover.The pupils did this: they asked a man in the village and he invited them in.So they came and sat down to table—Jesus and twelve pupils, Judas among them.Jesus knew that Judas Iscariot had already promised to betray him to death: but he did not accuse him and did not revenge himself, but as all his life he had taught his pupils love, so now he only reproved Judas lovingly.When they all twelve had sat down to table, he looked at them and said: Among you sits one who has betrayed me.Yes, he who eats and drinks with me will destroy me.And he said nothing more, so that they did not know of whom he spoke, and began to eat.When they began to eat, Jesus took bread, broke it into twelve pieces, gave each of the pupils a piece, and said: Take and eat this—it is my body.Summarization models summary:

And then he filled a cup with wine, handed it to the pupils and said: Drink all of you of this cup.And when they had all drunk he said: This is my blood.I shed it that people may know my will that they should forgive one another their sins.For I shall soon die and shall not be with you any more in this world, but shall join you only in the kingdom of heaven.After that, Jesus rose from table, girt himself with a towel, took a ewer of water, and began to wash the feet of all the pupils.When he came to Peter, Peter protested and said: Why should you wash my feet?Jesus said to him: It seems strange to you that I should wash your feet, but you will soon know why I do this.Though you are clean, not all of you are so: among you is my betrayer, to whom I gave bread and wine with my own hands and whose feet I wish to wash.And when Jesus had washed the feet of all his pupils, he sat down again and said: Do you understand why I did this?I have done it that you may always do the same to one another.I, your teacher, do this that you may know how to behave with those who do you harm.If you have understood this and will do it, then you will be happy.When I said that one of you would betray me I did not speak of you all, for only one of you, whose feet I washed and who ate bread with me, will destroy me.And having said this Jesus was troubled in spirit and again said: Yes, yes, one of you will betray me.And again the pupils began to look at one another, not knowing of whom he spoke.One of them sat near Jesus, and Simon.Peter made a sign to him that he should ask Jesus who the betrayer was.And he did so.

Jesus said: I will soak a bit of bread and will give it to him and he to whom I give it is my betrayer.And he gave the bread to Judas Iscariot and said to him: What you wish to do, do quickly.And Judas understood that he must go away, and as soon as he had taken the sop he at once went out.And he could not be followed as it was night.When Judas had gone, Jesus said: It is now clear to you what the son of man is—that in him is God, to make him as blessed as God Himself.Children!I shall not be with you long.Do not argue over my teaching, as I said to the Orthodox, but do what I do.I give you a new commandment: as I have always and to the end loved you; do you always and to the end love one another.By that alone will you be distinguished.Seek only thus to be distinguished from other men—love one another.And after that they went to the Mount of Olives.On the way there Jesus said to them: Now the time is coming when what was said in the scriptures will happen: the shepherd will be killed and the sheep will all be scattered.It will happen to-night.I shall be taken and you will all abandon me and scatter.And Peter said to him: Though all others may be frightened and scatter, I will not deny you.I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.And Jesus said to him: I tell you that to-night, after I have been taken, before cock-crow, you will deny me not once but thrice.Peter answered that he would never deny him; and all the other pupils said the same.Then Jesus said to them: Formerly neither I nor you lacked anything.You went without a wallet and without change of shoes, as I bade you.Summarization models summary:

You are my equals if you do what I have taught you.I do not consider you as slaves to whom orders are given, but as equals, for I have explained to you all that I have understood from the Father.You do not choose my teaching of your own will, you choose it because I have shown you the one truth by which you can live, and from which you will have all that you wish.The whole teaching is—to love one another.If the world hates you, do not be surprised: it hates my teaching.If you were at one with the world it would love you.But I have taken you out of the world, and for that it will hate you.If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also, and they will do all this because they do not know the true God.I explained to them, but they did not wish to hear me.They did not understand my teaching because they did not understand the Father.They saw my life and my life showed them their error, and they hated me yet more on that account.The spirit of truth which will come to you will confirm this to you.But confirm it yourselves.I tell you this beforehand, that you may not be deceived when they persecute you.They will cast you out; they will think that by killing you they are doing what pleases God.And they will do all this because they do not understand either my teaching or the true God.I tell you this beforehand that you may not be surprised when it comes about.So I go now to that spirit which sent me, and now that you understand, you need not ask me where I am going to.Before this you were grieved that I did not tell you whither I go.But I tell you truly that it is well for you that I am going.If I do not die the spirit of truth will not come to you, but if I die it will abide in you.

That spirit will dwell in you, and it will be clear to you what is false, what is true, and how to make decision.The falsity is, that men do not believe in the life of the spirit: the truth is, that I am one with the Father: and the decision is, to destroy the power of bodily life.I would say much more to you, but it is hard for you to understand.But when the spirit of truth dwells in you it will show you the whole truth because it will not tell you a new thing of its own, but what is from God; and it will show you the way in all circumstances of life.It too will be from the Father as I am from the Father, and therefore it will tell you the same that I do.But when I, as the spirit of truth, shall be in you, you will not always know that I am there.Sometimes you will, and sometimes you will not, hear me.And the pupils said to one another: What does this mean?He says: Sometimes you will, and sometimes you will not, hear me.What does it mean—Sometimes you will and sometimes you will not?Jesus said to them: Do you not understand what it means—Sometimes you will, and sometimes you will not, hear me?You know how it is in the world: some are sad and grieved while others rejoice.You too will grieve, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.A woman in labour suffers torment, but when it is over she does not remember the suffering, for joy that she has brought a child into the world.So you will grieve, and will then suddenly realize my presence: the spirit of truth will enter into you and your grief will be turned into joy.Then you will ask nothing of me, because you will have all you desire.Then all that any one of you desires in the spirit he will have from his Father.Summarization models summary:

You formerly asked nothing of the spirit, but then you shall ask what you will and it will all be yours, so that your joy will be full.Now, as a man, I cannot tell you this clearly in words, but then—when as the spirit of truth I shall live in you—I will proclaim to you clearly about the Father.Then all that you ask of the Father in the name of the spirit will be given you not by me but by the Father, for He loves you for having received my teaching and understood that the spirit comes into the world from the Father and returns from the world to the Father.Then the pupils said to Jesus: Now we understand everything and have nothing more to ask.We believe that you are from God.And Jesus said: All that I have told you is to give you peace and confidence in my teaching.Whatever ills may befall you in the world, fear nothing: my teaching will overcome the world.After that Jesus raised his eyes to heaven, and said:My Father!You have given your son the freedom of life in order that he should receive the true life.Life is the knowledge of the true God of the understanding revealed by me.I have revealed you to men on earth.I have done what you bade me.I have shown men on earth that you exist.They were yours before, but by your will I have revealed the truth to them and they have recognized you.They have understood that all they have, their very life, is from you alone and that I have taught them not of myself, but that I as well as they have come from you.I pray to you for those who acknowledge you.They have understood that all I have is yours and that what is yours is mine.I am no longer of this world, for I am returning to you; but they are in the world, and therefore, Father, I pray you, preserve in them your understanding.

I do not ask that you should take them from the world, but that you should deliver them from the evil of the world and confirm them in your truth.An understanding of you is the truth.My Father!I wish them to be as I am, to understand as I do that the true life began before the commencement of the world: that they should all be one, as you, Father, are in me and I in you, and that they should be one with us—I in them and you in me, so that all should be one: and that men should understand that they were not self-created, but that you have sent them into the world in love, as you sent me.Father of truth!The world did not know you, but I knew you and men have known you through me.I have made plain to them what you are.You are in me that the love with which you have loved me may be in them also.You have given them life, which is proof that you love them.I have taught them to know this and to love you, so that your love may return to you from them.THE VICTORY OF SPIRIT OVER MATTER

She looked at Peter and said to the others: See, this man is like one who was with Jesus of Nazareth.Peter was still more frightened, and swore that he had never been with Jesus and did not know him at all.A little later people went up to Peter and said: It is easy to see that you also were one of these disturbers.We can tell by your speech that you are from Galilee.Then Peter began to affirm and swear that he had never known or seen Jesus.And he had hardly said this before the cock crew.And he remembered the words Jesus had said to him when he had assured Jesus that though all should abandon him he would not deny him: 'Before the cock crows this night you will deny me thrice.'And Peter went out into the yard and wept bitterly.He wept because he had fallen into temptation: he had fallen into one temptation, that of strife, when he tried to defend Jesus, and into another temptation, the fear of death, when he denied Jesus.And the Orthodox chief priests, the scribes, and the officers, came together to the high priest.And when they were all assembled, they brought in Jesus, and the high priest asked him what his teaching was and who were his pupils.And Jesus answered: I always spoke openly before all men and hid nothing, and I hide nothing from anyone.Why do you ask me?Ask those who heard and understood my teaching.They will tell you.When Jesus said this, a servant of the high priest struck him in the face and said: To whom are you speaking?Is that the way to answer the High Priest?Jesus said: If I have spoken ill, tell me what I have said that is wrong.But if I said nothing ill, why strike me?The Orthodox chief priests tried to accuse Jesus, but at first found no proof on which he could be condemned.Summarization models summary:

Then they found two witnesses who said of him: We ourselves heard this man say: 'I will destroy this temple of yours made with hands and in three days will build up another temple to God, not made with hands.'But this evidence also was not enough to convict him.And so the high priest called Jesus up and said: Why do you not answer their evidence?Jesus remained silent.Then the high priest said to him: Tell me, are you the Christ, a son of God?Jesus answered him and said: Yes, I am the Christ, a son of God.And you will yourself now see that the son of man is equal to God.Then the high priest cried out: you blasphemer!Now we need no more evidence.We have all heard that you are a blasphemer!And the high priest turned to the assembly and said: You have yourselves heard that he blasphemes God.What do you condemn him to for that?And they answered: We condemn him to death.Then all the people and the guards fell upon Jesus and spat in his face and struck him and mishandled him.They bound his eyes, and hit him on the cheek and asked: Now, prophet, who was it that struck you?Jesus held his peace.Having reviled him, they led him bound to Pontius Pilate and took him to the hall of judgment.Pilate the governor came out to them and asked: Of what do you accuse this man?They said: He is an evil doer, so we have brought him to you.Pilate said to them: But if he does you harm, judge him yourselves according to your law.But they replied: We have brought him to you that you may execute him, for the law does not allow us to kill anyone.And so what Jesus had expected came to pass.

He had said that he must be ready to die on the cross at the hands of the Romans instead of dying a natural death or perishing at the hands of the Jews.And when Pilate asked what they accused him of, they said he was guilty of stirring up the people, forbidding them to pay tribute to Caesar, and made himself out to be the Christ and a king.Pilate listened to what they had to say, and then ordered Jesus to be brought to him to the judgement seat.When he came in, Pilate said: So you are king of the Jews?Jesus replied: Do you really think I am a king, or are you only repeating what has been told you?Pilate said: I am not a Jew so you cannot be my king, but your own people have brought you to me.What kind of a man are you?Jesus replied: I am a king, but my kingdom is not an earthly one.If I were an earthly king my subjects would fight for me and would not have given me up to the chief priests.But, as you see, my kingdom is not an earthly one.Pilate replied: Yet you consider yourself a king?Jesus said: Not only I, but you also, cannot but account me a king.I only teach in order to reveal to all men the truth of the kingdom of heaven.And everyone who lives by the truth is a king.Pilate said: You speak of 'the truth'—but what is truth?And having said this he turned away and went out to the chief priests and said to them: I do not find that this man has done anything wrong.But the chief priests insisted, and said that he did much evil and stirred up the people and had raised all Judea, right from Galilee.Then Pilate again began to question Jesus in the presence of the chief priests, but Jesus did not answer.Summarization models summary:

Pilate then said to him: Do you not hear how they accuse you?Why do you not defend yourself?But Jesus was still silent and said not another word, so that Pilate wondered at him.Then Pilate remembered that Galilee was under the jurisdiction of King Herod, and asked: Is he not from Galilee?They told him: Yes.Then he said: If he is from Galilee he is under Herod's authority and I will send him to him.Herod was then in Jerusalem, and Pilate, to rid himself of Jesus, sent him to Herod.Herod was very glad to see Jesus when they brought him.He had heard much about him and wished to know what kind of a man he was.So he called him up before him and began to question him about all he wished to know.But Jesus gave him no answer.And the chief priests and scribes accused him vehemently, as they had done before Pilate, and said that he was a rioter.And Herod regarded Jesus as an empty fellow, and to mock him had him dressed in a crimson robe, and sent him back to Pilate.Herod was pleased that Pilate had treated him with respect by sending Jesus to him to be judged, and so they were reconciled after having previously been at variance.Now when Jesus was brought back to Pilate, Pilate again called the chief priests and rulers of the Jews and said to them.You brought this man to me for stirring up the people, and I examined him in your presence and do not find him to be a rioter.I sent him with you to Herod, and you see that again he is not convicted of any wrong-doing.I do not see any reason for condemning him to death: would it not be better to chastise him and let him go?But when the chief priests heard this, they all cried out: No, punish him in the Roman way!Crucify him!

Pilate listened to the chief priests and said to them: Very well!But you have a custom at the feast of the Passover to pardon one prisoner.Well, here I have in prison Barabbas, a murderer and robber.Which of the two shall be released: Jesus or Barabbas?Pilate wished thus to save Jesus, but the chief priests had so influenced the people that they all cried out: Barabbas!Barabbas!And Pilate said: But what shall be done with Jesus?They again cried: Crucify him in the Roman way, crucify him!And Pilate tried to persuade them, and said: Why are you so hard on him?He has done nothing to deserve death and has done you no harm.I will let him go, for I find no fault in him.The chief priests and their servants cried: Crucify him!Crucify him!And Pilate said to them: Then take him and crucify him yourselves, for I see no fault in him.The chief priests answered: We ask only what our law demands.By our law he ought to die for making himself out to be a son of God.When Pilate heard these words he was troubled, for he did not know what the term 'son of God' meant.And returning to the judgement hall he again called up Jesus and asked him: Who are you and where are you from?But Jesus did not answer him.Then Pilate said to him: Why do you not answer me?Do you not see that you are in my power and that I can crucify you or set you free?Jesus answered him: You have no power.All power is above.Still Pilate wished to release Jesus, and he said to the Jews: How is it that you wish to crucify your king?Summarization models summary:

But they said to him: If you release Jesus you will show yourself a disloyal servant to Caesar, for he who sets himself up as a king is Caesar's enemy.Our king is Caesar; but let this man be crucified!When Pilate heard these words he understood that he could not refuse to execute Jesus.And he went out to the Jews, took some water, washed his hands, and said: I am not guilty of the blood of this just man.And the people all cried: Let his blood be upon us and on our children!So the chief priests prevailed.And Pilate sat on his judgement seat and ordered Jesus first to be scourged.After the soldiers had scourged him they put a wreath on his head and a rod in his hand and threw a red cloak on him and began to mock him, bowing down before him mocking and saying: Hail, King of the Jews!And they struck him on the cheek and on the head, and spat in his face.But the chief priests cried: Crucify him!Our king is Caesar!Crucify him!So Pilate gave orders that he should be crucified.They stripped Jesus of the red cloak and put on him his own clothing, and bade him carry the cross to a place called Golgotha, there to be crucified.And he carried his cross and so came to Golgotha.And there they stretched him on a cross between two other men.When they were nailing him to the cross, Jesus said: Father, forgive them: they know not what they do.And when Jesus was hanging on the cross the people thronged round him and railed at him.They went up, wagged their heads at him, and said: So you wished to destroy the temple of Jerusalem and rebuild it in three days!Well now, save yourself and come down from the cross!

And the chief priests and leaders stood there also and mocked him, saying: He saved others, but cannot save himself.Show us now that you are the Christ.Come down from the cross and we will believe you.He said he was the son of God and that God would not forsake him!Has not God forsaken him?And the people and the chief priests and the soldiers railed at him, and even one of the robbers crucified with him railed at him.This robber, railing at him, said: If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!But the other robber heard this and said: Do you not fear God?You are yourself on the cross and yet rail at an innocent man.You and I are executed for our deserts, but this man has done no harm.And turning to Jesus he said: Lord, remember me in your kingdom!And Jesus said to him: Even now you are blessed with me!And at the ninth hour Jesus, worn out, cried aloud: Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani!which means: My God, my God!Why hast thou forsaken me?And when the people heard this, they began to jeer and said: He is calling the prophet Elias!Let us see whether Elias will come!Then Jesus said: I thirst!And a man took a sponge, dipped it in vinegar that stood by, and gave it to Jesus on a reed.And when Jesus had sucked the sponge he cried out in a loud voice: It is finished!Father, into Thy hands I resign my spirit!And letting his head droop he gave up the ghost.A SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTERSI

He said that if people changed their way of life, considered all men equal, and instead of injuring helped one another, God would appear and His Kingdom would be established on earth.Having heard this preaching, Jesus withdrew into the desert to consider the meaning of man's life and his relation to the infinite origin of all, called God.Jesus recognized as his Father that infinite source of being whom John called God.Having stayed in the desert for some days without food, Jesus suffered hunger and thought within himself:As a son of God Almighty I ought to be all-powerful as He is, but now that I want to eat and cannot create bread to satisfy my hunger, I see that I am not all-powerful.But to this reflection he made answer: I cannot make bread out of stones, but I can refrain from eating, and so, though I am not all-powerful in the body, I am all-powerful in spirit and can quell the body.Therefore I am a son of God not through the flesh but through the spirit.Then he said to himself: I am a son of the spirit.Let me therefore renounce the body and do away with it.But to this he replied: I am born as spirit embodied in flesh.Such is the will of my Father and I must not resist His will.But—he went on thinking—if I can neither satisfy the needs of my body nor free myself from it, then I ought to devote myself to the body and enjoy all the pleasures it can afford me.But to this he replied: I cannot satisfy the needs of my body, and cannot rid myself of it; but my life is all-powerful in that it is the spirit of my Father.Therefore in my body I should serve the spirit, my Father, and work for Him alone.And becoming convinced that man's true life lies only in the spirit of the Father, Jesus left the desert and began to declare this teaching to men.

He said that the spirit dwelt in him, that henceforth the heavens were open and the powers of heaven brought to man, and a free and boundless life had begun for man, and that all men, however unfortunate in the body, might be happy.II
THE Jews who considered themselves Orthodox worshipped an external God, whom they regarded as creator and ruler of the universe.According to their teaching this external God had made an agreement with them by which He had promised to help them if they would worship Him.A chief condition of this alliance was the keeping of Saturday, the Sabbath.But Jesus said: The Sabbath is a human institution.That man should live in the spirit is more than all external ceremonies.Like all external forms of religion the keeping of the Sabbath involves a delusion.You are forbidden to do anything on the Sabbath, but good actions should always be done and if keeping the Sabbath hinders the doing of a good action then the keeping of the Sabbath is an error.According to the Orthodox Jews another condition of the agreement with God was avoidance of intercourse with unbelievers.Of this Jesus said that God desires not sacrifice to Himself, but that men should love one another.Yet another condition of the agreement related to rules for washing and purifying, as to which Jesus said that what God demands is not external cleanliness, but pity and love towards man.He also said that external rules are harmful, and that the church tradition is itself an evil.Their church tradition set aside the most important things, such as love for one's mother and father—and justified this by its traditional rulings.Of all the external regulations of the old law defining the cases in which a man was considered to have defiled himself, Jesus said: Know all of you, that nothing from outside can defile a man, only what he thinks and does can defile him.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
After this Jesus went to Jerusalem, the city considered holy, and entered into the temple where the Orthodox considered that God Himself dwelt, and there he said that it was useless to offer God sacrifices, that man is more important than a temple, and that our only duty is to love our neighbor and help him.Furthermore Jesus taught that it is not necessary to worship God in any particular place, but to serve the Father in spirit and in deed.The spirit cannot be seen or shown.The spirit is man's consciousness of his sonship to the Infinite Spirit.No temple is necessary.The true temple is the society of men united in love.He said that all external worship of God is not only false and injurious when it conduces to wrong-doing—like the Jew's worship which prescribed killing as a punishment, and allowed the neglect of parents—but also because a man performing external rites accounts himself righteous and free from the need of doing what love demands.He said that only he seeks what is good and does good deeds, who feels his own imperfections.To do good deeds a man must be conscious of his own faults, but external worship leads to a false self-satisfaction.All external worship is unnecessary, and should be thrown aside.Deeds of love are incompatible with ceremonial performances, and good cannot be done in that way.Man is a spiritual son of God and should therefore serve the Father in spirit.III
JOHN'S pupils asked Jesus what he meant by his 'kingdom of heaven', and he answered them: The kingdom of heaven I preach is the same as that preached by John—that all men, however poor, may be happy.And Jesus said to the people: John is the first prophet to preach to men a Kingdom of God which is not of the external world, but in the soul of man.

The Orthodox went to hear John, but understood nothing because they know only what they have themselves invented about an external God; they teach their inventions and are astonished that no one pays heed to them.But John preached the truth of the Kingdom of God within us, and therefore he did more than anybody before him.By his teaching the law and the prophets, and all external forms of worship, are superseded.Since he taught, it has been made clear that the Kingdom of God is in man's soul.The beginning and the end of everything is the soul of man.Every man, though he realizes that he was conceived by a bodily father in his mother's womb, is conscious also that he has within him a spirit that is free, intelligent, and independent of the body.That eternal spirit proceeding from the infinite, is the origin of all and is what we call God.We know Him only as we recognize Him within ourselves.That spirit is the source of our life; we must rank it above everything and by it we must live.By making it the basis of our life we obtain true and everlasting life.The Father-spirit who has given that spirit to man cannot have sent it to deceive men—that while conscious of everlasting life in themselves they should lose it.This infinite spirit in man must have been given that through him men should have an infinite life.Therefore the man who conceives of this spirit as his life has infinite life, while a man who does not so conceive it has no true life.Men can themselves choose life or death: life in the spirit, or death in the flesh.The life of the spirit is goodness and light: the life of the flesh is evil and darkness.To believe in the spirit, means to do good deeds; to disbelieve means to do evil.Goodness is life, evil is death.God—an external creator, the beginning of all beginnings—we do not know.Summarization models summary:

Our conception of Him can only be this: that He has sown the spirit in men as a sower sows his seed, everywhere, not discriminating as to what part of the field; and the seed that falls on good ground grows, but what falls on sterile ground perishes.The spirit alone gives life to men, and it depends on them to preserve it or lose it.For the spirit, evil does not exist.Evil is an illusion of life.There is only that which lives and that which does not live.Thus the world presents itself to all men, and each man has a consciousness of the kingdom of heaven in his soul.Each one can of his own free will enter that kingdom or not.To enter it he must believe in the life of the spirit, for he who believes in that life has everlasting life.IV
JESUS was sorry for people because they did not know true happiness, therefore he taught them.He said:Blessed are they who have no property or fame and do not care for them, and unhappy are they who seek riches and fame; for the destitute and the oppressed are in the Father's will, but the rich and famous seek only rewards from men in this temporary life.To fulfil the will of the Father do not fear to be poor and despised, but rejoice that you can show men what true happiness is.To carry out the will of the Father which gives life and welfare to all men, five commandments must be obeyed:The first commandment is to do no ill to anyone so as not to arouse anger, for evil begets evil.The second commandment is not to go after women and not to desert the wife with whom you have once been joined; for desertion and change of wives causes all the world's dissoluteness.The third commandment is to take no oath of any kind.A man can promise nothing, for he is altogether in the Father's power; and oaths are taken for bad purposes.

The fourth commandment is not to resist evil, not to condemn, and not to go to law; but to endure wrong and to do even more than people demand, for every man is full of faults and incapable of guiding others.By taking revenge, we only teach others to do the same.The fifth commandment is not to discriminate between fellow-countrymen and foreigners, for all are children of one Father.These five commandments should be observed not to win praise from men, but for your own welfare; therefore do not pray, or fast, in the sight of men.The Father knows all that people need, and there is no need to pray for anything; all that is necessary is to seek to be in the Father's will.And His will is that we should not feel enmity towards anyone.It is unnecessary to fast, for men fast merely to win praise from men and their praise should be avoided.It is necessary only to take care to live in the Father's will, and the rest will all be added of itself.A man concerned with the things of the body cannot be concerned with the kingdom of heaven.Even though a man does not trouble about food and clothing, he can live: the Father will give life.All that is needful is to be in the will of the Father at the present moment, for the Father gives his children what they need.Desire only the power of the spirit, which the Father gives.The five commandments show the path to the kingdom of heaven, and this narrow path alone leads to everlasting life.False teachers—wolves pretending to be sheep—always try to lead people astray from this path.Beware of them!False teachers can always be detected by the fact that they teach evil in the name of good.If they teach violence and executions they are false teachers.By what they teach they may be known.Not he fulfills the Father's will who calls on the name of God, but he who does what is good.Summarization models summary:

He who fulfils these five commandments will have a secure and true life, of which nothing can deprive him: but he who does not fulfil them will have an insecure life which will soon be taken from him, leaving him nothing.The teaching of Jesus surprised and attracted the people by the fact that it recognized all men as free.It was the fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy, that God's chosen one would bring light to men, would overcome evil and re-establish truth, not by violence but by gentleness, meekness, and kindness.V
WISDOM lies in recognizing life as the offspring of the Father's spirit.People set themselves the aims of the bodily life, and in seeking these aims torment themselves and others.But they will find full satisfaction in the life meant for them—the life of the spirit—if they accept the doctrine of the spiritual life and of subduing and controlling the body.It happened once that Jesus asked a woman of another religion to give him some water to drink.She refused on the plea that she was of a different faith.Jesus then said to her: If you understood that he who is asking for water is a living man in whom the spirit of the Father lives, you would not refuse him, but by doing a kindness would try to unite yourself in spirit with the Father, and that spirit would give you not such water as this—after drinking which a man thirsts again—but water that gives everlasting life.One need not pray to God in any special place, but should serve Him by deeds of love—by ministering to those in whom His spirit dwells.And Jesus said to his pupils: The true food of man is to fulfil the will of the Father-spirit, and this fulfilment is always possible.Our whole life is a gathering up of the fruits of the spirit sown within us by the Father.Those fruits are the good we do to men.We should do good to men unceasingly and expect no reward.

After this Jesus happened to be in Jerusalem and came to a bathing-place beside which lay a sick man, waiting for a miracle to cure him.Jesus said this to him: Do not expect to be cured by a miracle, but live according to your strength and do not mistake the meaning of life.The invalid obeyed Jesus, got up, and went away.Seeing this, the Orthodox began to reproach Jesus for having cured an invalid on the Sabbath.Jesus said to them: I have done nothing new.I have only done what our common Father-spirit does.He lives and gives life to men, and I have done likewise.To do this is every man's business.Everyone has freedom to choose life or reject it.To choose life is to fulfil the will of the Father by doing good to others; to reject it is to do one's own will and not do good to others.It is in each one's power to do the one or the other: to receive life or destroy it.The true life of man can be compared to this: A master apportioned to his slaves a valuable property and told them each to work on what was given him.Some of them worked, others simply put away what had been given them.Then the master demanded an account of what they had done, and to those who had worked he gave still more of his property, while from those who had not worked he took away all that they had.The portion of the master's valuable property is the spirit of life in man, who is the son of the Father-spirit.He who in this life works for the sake of the spirit-life receives infinite life, he who does not work loses what was given him.The only true life is the life common to all, and not the life of the individual.Each should work for the life of others.After that Jesus went to a desert place and many people followed him.Summarization models summary:

Towards evening his pupils came and said: How can we feed all these people?Among the gathering were some who had no food, and some who had bread and fish.Jesus said to his pupils: Give me what bread you have.And he took the loaves and gave the bread to his pupils, and they gave it away to others, who began to do the same.So everyone ate what was distributed in this way, and they all had enough without eating all the food that was there.And Jesus said: That is how you should always act.It is not necessary for each man to obtain food for himself but it is needful to do what the spirit in man demands, namely to share what there is with others.The true food of man is the spirit of the Father.Man lives only by the spirit.We must serve all that has life, for life lies not in doing one's own will but the will of the Father of life.And that will is that the life of the spirit, which each one has, should remain in him and that all should cherish the life of the spirit in them until the hour of death.The Father, the source of all life, is the spirit.Life consists only in carrying out the will of the Father, and to carry out that will of the spirit one must surrender the body.The body is food for the life of the spirit.Only by sacrificing the body does the spirit live.After this Jesus chose certain pupils and sent them about to preach the doctrine of the life of the spirit.When sending them he said: You are going to preach the life of the spirit, therefore renounce in advance all fleshly desires and have nothing of your own.Be prepared for persecution, privation, and suffering.Those who love the life of the body will hate you, torment you, and kill you; but do not be afraid.If you fulfil the will of the Father you possess the life of the spirit, of which no one can deprive you.

The pupils set out and when they returned they announced that they had everywhere overcome the teaching of evil.Then the Orthodox said to Jesus that his teaching, even if it overcame evil, was itself an evil, for those who carry it out must endure sufferings.To this Jesus said: Evil cannot overcome evil.Evil can only be mastered by goodness, and that goodness is the will of the Father-spirit, common to all men.Every man knows what is good for himself, and if he does that for others—if he does that which is the will of the Father—he will do good.And so the carrying out of the will of the Father-spirit is good even if it be accompanied by the suffering and death of those who fulfil that will.VI
JESUS said that his mother and his brothers had no prior claim on him as such, only those were never to him who fulfilled the will of their common Father.A man's life and blessedness depend not on family relationships, but on the life of the spirit.Jesus said: Blessed are those who retain their understanding of the Father.A man living in the spirit has no home—the spirit cannot own a house.He said that he himself had no fixed abode.To fulfil the Father's will no special place is needed, for it is always and everywhere possible.The death of the body cannot be dreadful to a man who resigns himself to the will of the Father, for the life of the spirit does not depend on that of the body.Jesus says that he who believes in the life of the spirit can fear nothing.No cares make it impossible for a man to live in the spirit.To one who said that he would obey the teaching of Jesus later, but must first bury his father, Jesus replied: Only the dead trouble about the burial of the dead, the living live always by fulfilling the will of the Father.Family and household cares must not hinder the life of the spirit.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
He who is troubled about what results to his bodily life from the fulfilment of the Father's will, acts like a ploughman who looks back while ploughing, instead of in front of him.Cares for the pleasure of the bodily life, which seem so important to men, are delusions.The only real business of life is the announcement of the Father's will, attention to it, and fulfilment of it.When Martha complained that she alone busied herself about the supper, while her sister Mary listened to his teaching instead of helping, Jesus replied: You blame her unjustly.If you need the results of your work, busy yourself with it, but let those who do not need physical pleasures attend to the one thing essential for life.Jesus said: He who desires to obtain true life, consisting in the fulfilment of the Father's will, must first of all give up his own personal desires.He must not only not plan his life according to his own wishes, but must be ready to endure privation and suffering at any moment.He who desires to arrange his bodily life according to his own desires, will wreck the true life of fulfilment of the Father's will.And there is no advantage in gain for the physical life if that gain wrecks the life of the spirit.Most ruinous of all for the life of the spirit is the love of gain, of getting rich.Men forget that whatever riches or goods they obtain they may die at any moment, and that property is not essential for life.Death hangs over each of us.Sickness, murder, or accident, may at any moment end our life.Bodily death is an inescapable condition of every second of our life.While a man lives he should regard every hour of life as a postponement of death granted by someone's kindness.We should remember this, and not say we do not know it.

We know and foresee all that happens on earth and in the sky, but forget death, which we know awaits us at any moment.Unless we forget death we cannot yield ourselves to the life of the body; for we cannot reckon on it.To follow the teaching of Christ we must count up the advantages of following our own will and serving the bodily life, and the advantages of fulfilling the Father's will.Only he who has clearly taken account of this can be a disciple of Christ.But he who makes the calculation will not regret having to forgo this unreal happiness and unreal life in order to obtain the true good and the true life.True life is given to men and they know it and hear its call, but constantly distracted by the cares of the moment they deprive themselves of it.True life is like a feast a rich man gave, and to which he invited guests.He called them—just as the voice of the Father-spirit calls all men to Himself.But some of those invited were busy with trading, others with their farms, others again with family affairs, and they did not go to the feast.Only the poor who had no worldly cares went to the feast and gained happiness.So men distracted by cares for the bodily life deprive themselves of true life.He who does not wholly reject the cares and gains of the bodily life cannot fulfil the Father's will, for no man can serve himself a little and the Father a little: he has to consider whether it is better to serve his body and whether it is possible to arrange his life according to his own will.He must do as a man does who wishes to build a house, or to prepare for war.That man first considers whether he has means to finish his house, or to conquer his enemy.And if he sees that he has not, he will not waste his labor or his army uselessly, and make himself a laughing-stock to his neighbours.Summarization models summary:

If a man could arrange his bodily life to his own will, then it might be well to serve the body, but as that is impossible, it is better to reject bodily things and serve the spirit.Otherwise you will gain neither the one thing nor the other.You will not arrange the bodily life satisfactorily, and will lose the life of the spirit.Therefore to fulfil the Father's will it is necessary to sacrifice the bodily life.The bodily life is wealth entrusted to us by another, which we should use so as to gain our own true riches.If a rich man has a manager who knows that however well he may serve his master, that master will dismiss him leaving him with nothing, the manager will be wise if while managing his master's affairs he does favours to other people.Then when the master dismisses him, those whom he has benefited will receive him and sustain him.That is how men deal in their bodily life.The bodily life is that wealth, not our own, which is entrusted to us for a time.If we make good use of that wealth which is not our own, then we shall receive true wealth which will be our own.If we do not give up wealth that is not our own, we shall not receive our true wealth.We cannot serve both the illusory life of the body and the life of the spirit; we must serve the one or the other.A man cannot serve property and God.What is honourable among men is an abomination before God.In God's sight riches are evil.A rich man is guilty in that he eats much and luxuriously, while at his door the poor are hungry.And everyone knows that property not shared with others is held in non-fulfilment of the Father's will.A rich, Orthodox ruler came once to Jesus and began to boast that he fulfilled all the commandments of the law.Jesus reminded him that there is a commandment to love others as oneself and that that is the Father's will.

The ruler said he kept that also.Then Jesus said to him: That is not true; if you really wished to fulfil the Father's will you would not possess property.You cannot fulfil the Father's will if you have property of your own which you do not give to others.And Jesus said to his pupils: Men think it impossible to live without property, but I tell you that true life consists in giving what you have to others.A certain man named Zaccheus heard the teaching of Jesus and believed it, and having invited Jesus to his house said to him: I am giving half my fortune to the poor and will restore fourfold to those I have wronged.And Jesus said: Here is a man who fulfils the Father's will, for a man's whole life must be passed in fulfilment of that will, and there is no condition in which a man can say: 'I have fulfilled the will of God.'Good cannot be measured; it is impossible to say who has done more or less.A widow who gives away her last farthing gives more than a rich man who gives thousands.Nor can goodness be measured by its usefulness.Let the case of the woman who felt pity for Jesus and recklessly poured over his feet many pounds' worth of costly oil serve as an example.Judas said she had acted foolishly because the cost of the oil would have sufficed to feed many people.But Judas was a thief and a liar, and when he spoke of the material advantage he was not thinking of the poor.The essential thing lies not in the utility of an action or the largeness of a gift, but what is necessary is always, every moment, to love others and give them what one has.VII

I teach what is good for the Father of all and is therefore good for all men.Do what I say, fulfil the five commandments, and you will see that what I say is true.Fulfilment of these five commandments will drive away all evil from the world, and therefore they are certainly true.It is clear that he who teaches the will of Him who sent him, and not his own will, teaches the truth.The law of Moses teaches the fulfilment of human desires and so it is full of contradictions; my teaching is to fulfil the will of the Father and so it is harmonious.The Jews did not understand him and looked for external proofs of whether he was the Christ mentioned in the prophecies.On this he said to them: Do not question who I am and whether it is of me that your prophecies speak, but attend to my teaching and to what I say about our common Father.You need not believe in me as a man, but you should believe what I tell you in the name of the common Father of us all.It is not necessary to inquire about external matters as to where I come from, but it is necessary to follow my teaching.He who follows it will receive true life.There can be no proofs of the truth of my teaching.It is the light itself, and as light cannot be illuminated, so truth cannot be proven true.My teaching is the light.He who sees it has light and life and needs no proofs, but he who is in darkness must come to the light.But the Jews again asked him who he was as to his bodily personality.He said to them: I am, as I told you from the first, a man, the son of the Father of life.Only he who so regards himself (this is the truth I teach) will fulfil the will of the common Father; only he will cease to be a slave and become a free man.

We are enslaved only by the error of taking the life of the body to be the true life.He who understands the truth—that life consists only in the fulfilment of the Father's will—becomes free and immortal.As a slave does not always remain in the house of his master, but the son does; so a man who lives as a slave to the flesh does not remain alive for ever, but he who fulfils in his soul the Father's will has eternal life.To understand me you must understand that my Father is not the same as your father whom you call God.Your father is a god of the flesh, but my Father is the spirit of life.Your father, your god, is a jealous god, a man-slayer, one who executes men.My Father gives life, and so we are the children of different fathers.I seek the truth, and you wish to kill me for that, to please your god.Your god is the devil, the source of evil, and in serving him you serve the devil.My teaching is that we are sons of the Father of life, and he who believes in my teaching shall not see death.The Jews asked: How can it be that a man will not die, when all those who pleased God most—even Abraham—have died?How then can you say that you, and those who believe in your teaching, will not die?To this Jesus replied: I speak not by my own authority.I speak of that same source of life that you call God, and that dwells in men.That source I know and cannot help knowing, and I know His will and fulfil it, and of that source of life I say that it has been, is, and will be, and that for it there is no death.Demands for proofs of the truth of my teaching are as if one demanded from a man who had been born blind, proofs of why and how he sees the light when his sight has been restored.Summarization models summary:

The blind man whose sight has been restored, remaining the same man he was, can only say that he was blind but now sees.And one who formerly did not understand the meaning of life but now does understand it, can only say the same, and nothing else.Such a man can only say that formerly he did not know the true good in life but now he knows it.A blind man whose sight has been restored, if told that he has not been cured in a proper manner and that he who restored his sight is an evil-doer, and that he should be cured differently, can only reply: I know nothing about the correctness of my cure or the sinfulness of him who cured me, or of a better way of being cured; I only know that whereas I was blind, now I see.And in the same way one who has understood the meaning of the teaching of true welfare and of the fulfilment of the Father's will, can say nothing as to the regularity of that teaching or whether he who disclosed it to him was a sinner, or of the possibility of a still greater blessedness, but can only say: Formerly I did not see the meaning of life, but now I see it and that is all I know.And Jesus said: My teaching is the awakening of a life till then asleep: he who believes my teaching awakens to eternal life and lives after death.My teaching is not proven in any way: men yield to it because it alone has the promise of life for all men.As sheep follow the shepherd who gives them food and guards their life, so men accept my teaching because it gives life to all.And as the sheep do not follow a thief who climbs over into the fold, but shy away from him, so men cannot believe these doctrines which teach violence and executions.My teaching is as a door for the sheep, and all who follow me shall find true life.

As only those shepherds are good who own and love the sheep and devote their lives to them, while hirelings who do not love the sheep are bad shepherds, so also only that teacher is true who does not spare himself, and he is worthless who cares only for himself.My teaching is that a man should not spare himself, but should sacrifice the life of the body for the life of the spirit.This I teach and fulfil.The Jews still did not understand and still wanted proofs of whether or not Jesus was the Christ, and whether, therefore, they should believe him or not.They said: Do not torment us, but tell us plainly, are you the Christ or not?And to this Jesus replied: Belief must be given not to words but to deeds.By the example I set, you may know whether I teach the truth or not.Do what I do, and do not discuss words.Fulfil the will of the Father, and then you will all be united with me and with the Father; for I, the son of man, am the same as the Father and the same that you call God and that I call the Father.I and the Father are one.Even in your own scriptures it is said that God said to men: 'You are Gods.'Every man by his spirit is a son of this Father.And if a man lives fulfilling the Father's will he becomes one with the Father.If I fulfil His will, the Father is in me and I am in the Father.After this Jesus asked his pupils how they understood his teaching about the son of man.Simon Peter answered him: Your teaching is that you are the son of the God of life, and God is the life of the spirit in man.And Jesus said to him: You are happy, Simon, to have understood that.Man could not have disclosed it to you, but you have understood it because the God in you has revealed it to you.Summarization models summary:

On this understanding the true life of men is founded.For that life there is no death.VIII
IN reply to doubts expressed by his pupils as to the reward resulting for renouncing the life of the flesh, Jesus said: For him who understands the meaning of my teaching there can be no question of a reward, first because a man who for its sake gives up family, friends, and possessions, gains a hundredfold more friends and more possessions, and secondly, because a man who seeks a reward seeks to have more than others have, and that is quite contrary to the fulfilment of the Father's will.In the kingdom of heaven there is neither greater nor less, all are equal.Those who seek a reward for goodness are like labourers who, because in their opinion they were more deserving than others, demanded larger pay than they had agreed upon with their employer.According to the teaching of Jesus no one can be either higher or more important than another.All can fulfil the Father's will, but in doing so no one becomes superior or more important or better than another.Only kings and those who serve them reckon in that way.According to my teaching, said Jesus, there can be no superior rank; he who wishes to be better should be the servant of all.My teaching is, that life is given to man not that others may serve him, but that he should give his whole life to the service of others.He who exalts himself instead of doing this, will fall lower than he was.The meaning and purpose of life must be understood before a man can be rid of thoughts of his own elevation.The meaning of life lies in fulfilling the will of the Father, and His will is that what He has given us shall be returned to Him.

As a shepherd leaves his whole flock and goes to seek a lost sheep, and as a woman will search everywhere to find a lost penny, so the Father's continual work is manifested to us by the fact that He draws to Himself that which pertains to Him.We must understand wherein true life consists.True life always appears in the lost being restored to where it belongs, and in the awakening of those that sleep.People who have the true life and have returned to the source of their being, cannot, like worldly men, account others as being better or worse, but being sharers of the Father's life can only rejoice at the return of the lost to the Father.If a son who has gone astray repents and returns to the father he had left, how can other sons of the same father be envious of his joy, or fail to rejoice at their brother's return?To believe in the teaching and to change our way of life and fulfil that teaching, what is needed is not external proofs or promises of rewards, but a clear understanding of what true life is.If men think themselves completely masters of their own lives, and believe that life is given them for bodily enjoyment, then clearly any sacrifice they make for others will seem to them an act worthy of reward, and without such reward they will give nothing.If tenants forgot that a garden was let to them on condition that they returned the fruits to the owner, and that rent was demanded of them again and again, they would seek to kill the collector.So it is with those who think themselves masters of their own lives and do not understand that life is granted them by an understanding which demands the fulfilment of its will.To believe and to act, it is necessary to understand that man can do nothing of himself, and that if he gives up his bodily life to serve goodness he does nothing that deserves either thanks or reward.We must understand that in doing good a man only does his duty and what he necessarily must do.Summarization models summary:

Only when he understands life in that way can a man have faith enabling him to do truly good deeds.The kingdom of heaven consists in that understanding of life.It is not a visible kingdom that can be pointed out in this or that place.The kingdom of heaven is in man's understanding.The whole world lives as of old: men eat and drink, marry, trade, and die, and along with this in the souls of men lives the kingdom of heaven—an understanding of life growing as a tree that in spring puts out leaves of itself.True life is the fulfilment of the will of the Father, not in the past or in the future, but now; it is what each of us must do at the present moment.And therefore to live the true life we must never relax.Men are set to guard life, not in the past or in the future, but the life now being lived, and in it to fulfil the will of the Father of all men.If they let this life escape them by not fulfilling the Father's will, they will not receive it back again.A watchman set to watch all night does not perform his duty if he falls asleep even for a moment, for a thief may come at that moment.So man should direct his whole strength to the present hour, for only then can he fulfil the Father's will; and that will is the life and blessing of all men.Only those live who are doing good.Good done to men now in the present, is the life that unites us with the common Father.IX
MAN is born with a knowledge of the true life which lies in the fulfilment of the Father's will.Children live by that knowledge: in them the will of the Father is seen.To understand the teaching of Jesus one must understand the life of children and be like them.Children live in the Father's will, not infringing the five commandments, and they would never infringe them were they not misled by adults.

Men ruin children by leading them to break these commandments.And by so doing they act as if they tied a millstone to a man's neck and threw him into the river.The world is unhappy only because people yield to temptations, but for that the world would be happy.Temptations lure men to do evil for the sake of imaginary advantages in their temporal life.Yielding to temptation ruins men, and therefore everything should be sacrificed rather than fall into temptation.The temptation to infringe the first commandment comes from men considering themselves in the right towards others, and others in the wrong towards themselves.To avoid falling into that temptation we must remember that all men are always infinitely in debt to the Father and can only acquit themselves of that debt by forgiving their brother men.Therefore men must forgive injuries, and not be deterred though the offender injures them again and again.However often a man may be wronged he must forgive, not remembering the wrong; for only by forgiveness can the kingdom of heaven be attained.If we do not forgive others, we act as a certain debtor did when, heavily in debt, he went to his creditor and begged for mercy.His creditor forgave him everything, but the debtor went away and meeting a man who owed him only a small sum, began to throttle him.To have life we must fulfil the Father's will.We ask forgiveness of Him for failing to fulfil His will, and hope to be forgiven.What then are we doing if we do not ourselves forgive others?We are doing to them what we dread for ourselves.The will of the Father is well-being; and evil is that which separates us from the Father.How then can we fail to seek to quench evil as quickly as possible, since it is that which ruins us and robs us of life?Evil entangles us in bodily destruction.In so far as we escape from that entanglement we obtain life and have all that we can desire.Summarization models summary:

We are not separated from one another by evil but are united by love.Men are tempted to infringe the second commandment by thinking of woman as created for bodily pleasure, and by supposing that by leaving one wife and taking another they will obtain more pleasure.To avoid falling into this temptation we must remember that the Father's will is, not that man should delight himself with woman's charms, but that each man having chosen a wife should be one with her.The Father's will is for each man to have one wife and each wife one husband.If each man keeps to one wife, each man will have a wife and each woman a husband.He who changes his wife deprives her of a husband and gives occasion for some other man to leave his wife and take the deserted one.A man need not marry at all, but must not have more than one wife, for if he does he goes against the will of the Father which is that one man should unite with one woman.Men are tempted to infringe the third commandment by creating, for the advantage of their temporal life, established authorities, and demanding from one another oaths by which they bind themselves to do what those authorities demand.To avoid falling into this temptation men must remember that they are indebted for their life to no power but God.The demands of authorities should be regarded as violence but, following the command of non-resistance to evil, men should yield what goods and labour the authorities may demand.But they must not pledge their conduct by taking oaths, for the oaths that are imposed lead to evil.He who recognizes his life as being in the will of the Father cannot bind his actions by pledges, for such a man holds his life most sacred.Men are tempted to infringe the fourth commandment by thinking that they can reform others by themselves yielding to anger and revenge.If a man wrongs another, people think he should be punished and that justice lies in human judgement.

To avoid falling into this temptation we must remember that men are called not to judge but to save one another, and that they cannot judge one another's faults because they are themselves full of wickedness.The one thing they can do is to teach others by an example of purity, forgiveness, and love.Men are tempted to infringe the fifth commandment by thinking that there is a difference between their own countrymen and those of other nations, and that it is therefore necessary to defend themselves against other nations and do them harm.To avoid falling into this temptation it is necessary to know that all the commandments may be summed up in this: to do good to all men without distinction, and thus fulfil the will of the Father who has given life and well-being to all.Even if others make such distinctions, and though nations, considering themselves alien to one another, go to war, yet each man, to fulfil the will of the Father, should do good to all—even to those belonging to a nation with which his country is at war.To avoid falling into human illusions we must think not of the physical but the spiritual life.If a man understands that life consists solely in now being in the Father's will, neither privations, nor sufferings, nor death, can seem dreadful to him.Only that man receives true life who is ready at every moment to give up his physical life in order to fulfil the Father's will.And that everyone may understand that true life is that in which there is no death, Jesus said: Eternal life should not be understood as being like the present life.For true life in the will of the Father there is neither space nor time.Those who are awake to the true life live in the Father's will for which there is neither space nor time.They live with the Father.If they have died for us, they live for God.Therefore one commandment includes in itself all: to love all men, each of whom has the source of life within him.Summarization models summary: 
Men are tempted to infringe the first commandment by thinking of woman as created for bodily pleasure and by thinking that by leaving one wife and taking another they will obtain more pleasure.
The Father's will is for each man to have only one wife, and each wife one husband.

Merging and summarizing: 
And Jesus said: That source of life is the Christ you are awaiting.The comprehension of that source of life, for whom there is no distinction of persons and no time or place, is the son of man whom I teach.All that hides that source of life from men is temptation.There is the temptation of the scribes, of the bookmen, and of the materialists—do not yield to it.There is the temptation of authority, do not yield to that: and there is also the most terrible temptation, from the religious teachers who call themselves Orthodox.Beware of this last temptation more than of all the others, because these self-ordained teachers, just they, by devising the worship of a false God decoy you from the true God.Instead of serving the Father of life by deeds, they substitute words, and teach words while they themselves do nothing.You can learn nothing from them but words, and the Father requires deeds.They can teach nothing because they themselves know nothing, and only for their own advantage wish to set themselves up as teachers.But you know that no man can be the teacher of another.There is one teacher for all men—the Lord of life—the understanding.But these self-styled teachers, thinking to teach others, deprive themselves of true life and hinder others from understanding it.They teach men that their God will be pleased by external rites, and think they can bring men to religion by vows.They are only concerned about externals.An outward assumption of religion satisfies them, but they do not think of what goes on in men's hearts.And so they are like showy sepulchres, handsome outside but loathsome within.In words they honour the saints and the martyrs, but they are just the people who formerly killed and tortured and who now kill and torture the saints.From them come all the world's temptations, for under the guise of good they teach evil.

The evil they create is the root of all others, for they defile the most holy thing in the world.They will continue their deceptions and increase evil in the world, and it will be long before they are changed.But a time will come when all their churches and all external worship of God will be destroyed, and men will understand, and unite in love, to serve the one God of life and to fulfil His will.X
THE Jews saw that the teaching of Jesus would destroy their State religion and their nationality, and at the same time saw that they could not refute it, so they decided to kill him.His innocence and rectitude hindered them, but the high priest Caiaphas devised a pretext for killing him even though Jesus was not guilty in any way.Caiaphas said: We need not discuss whether this man is innocent or guilty; we have to consider whether we wish our people to remain a separate Jewish nation or whether we wish it to be broken up and dispersed.The nation will perish and the people be scattered if we let this man alone and do not put him to death.This argument decided the matter, and the Orthodox agreed that Jesus must be put to death; and they instructed the people to seize him as soon as he appeared in Jerusalem.Though he knew of this, Jesus nevertheless went to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover.His pupils entreated him not to go, but he said: What the Orthodox wish to do to me, and all that any man may do, cannot alter the truth for me.If I see the light I know where I am and where I am going.Only he who does not know the truth can fear anything or doubt anything.Only he who does not see, stumbles.And he went to Jerusalem, stopping on the way at Bethany.Summarization models summary: 
The source of life is the Christ, and Jesus is the son of man.
There are many temptations, including those of authority, scribes, bookmen, and materialists, and religious teachers who call themselves Orthodox.
The temptation of self-ordained self-styled teachers, known as self-proclaimed self-taught teachers, is the most powerful temptation, because they use words to distract and distract from the true God.
They teach men that their God will be pleased by external rites and think they can bring men to religion by vows, but they are only concerned about the external aspects of religion and not what goes on in men's hearts.
Despite his innocence and rectitude, Jesus went to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover despite pleas from his pupils.

There Mary emptied a jar of precious oil on him, and when the pupils reproached her for wasting so much precious oil, Jesus, knowing that his bodily death was near at hand, said that what she had done was a preparation for his burial.When he left Bethany and went to Jerusalem crowds met and followed him, and this convinced the Orthodox still more of the need to kill him.They only wanted an opportunity to seize him.He knew that the least indiscreet word from him now, contrary to the law, would be used as a reason for his execution; but notwithstanding this he went into the temple and again declared that the Jewish worship of God with sacrifices and libations was false, and he again announced his teaching.But his teaching, based on the prophets, was such that the Orthodox could still find no palpable breach of the law for which they could condemn him to death, especially as most of the common people were on his side.But at the feast there were certain heathen who having heard of Jesus's teaching, wished to discuss it with him.The pupils hearing of this were alarmed.They feared lest Jesus by talking with the heathen might betray himself and excite the people.At first they did not want to put the heathen in touch with Jesus, but afterwards they decided to tell him that these men wished to speak with him.On hearing this, Jesus was troubled.He understood that his talk with the heathen would make clear his rejection of the whole Jewish law, would turn the crowd from him, and would give occasion to the Orthodox to accuse him of having intercourse with the hated heathen; and knowing this he was troubled.But he also knew that his mission was to make clear to men, the sons of one Father, their unity without distinction of faith.

He knew that to do this would cost him his bodily life but that its loss would give men a true understanding of life, and therefore he said: As a grain of wheat perishes to bear fruit, so I, a man, must give up my bodily life in order to bear spiritual fruit.He who holds fast to his bodily life loses his true life, but he who does not grudge his bodily life obtains the true life.I am troubled at what awaits me, but I have lived till now only in preparation for this hour, how then can I fail to act as I ought?So let the Father's will be manifested through me now.And turning to the people, heathen and Jews, Jesus declared openly what he had only said privately to Nicodemus.He said: Men's lives, with their different creeds and governments, must all be changed.All human authorities must disappear.It is only necessary to understand the nature of man as a son of the Father of life, and this understanding destroys all divisions of men and of authorities and makes all men one.The Jews said: You are destroying our whole creed.Our law tells of a Christ, but you speak only of a Son of Man and say that he should be exalted!What does that mean?He replied: To exalt the son of man means living by the light of understanding that exists in man, and while there is light, living by that light.I teach no new faith but only what each man may know within himself.Each man knows the life in himself, and each man knows that life is given to him and to all men by the Father of life.My teaching is only that man should love the life that the Father gives to us all.Many of the unofficial folk believed Jesus; but the notables and official classes did not believe him, because they did not wish to consider the universal purport of what he said, and thought only of its temporal bearings.Summarization models summary:

They saw that he turned the people from them and they wished to kill him; but they feared to take him openly, and wanted to do so secretly—not in Jerusalem and in the daytime.And one of his twelve pupils, Judas Iscariot, came to them, and they bribed him to take their emissaries to Jesus when he should be away from the people.Judas promised to do this, and went back to Jesus, awaiting a suitable opportunity to betray him.On the first day of the feast Jesus kept the Passover with his pupils, and Judas, thinking that Jesus was not aware of his treachery, was with them.But Jesus knew that Judas had sold him, and as they all sat at table he took bread, broke it into twelve pieces, and gave one to each of the pupils, to Judas as well as to the others, and without naming anyone, said: Take, eat my body.Then he took a cup with wine, gave it to them all, including Judas, to drink, and said: One of you will shed my blood.Drink my blood.Then he rose and washed all the pupils' feet, and when he had done so said: I know that one of you will betray me to death and will shed my blood, but I have fed him and given him drink and washed his feet.I have done this to show you how to behave to those who harm you.If you act so, you will be blessed.And the pupils all asked which of them was the betrayer.But Jesus did not name him, that they might not turn on him.When it grew dark, however, Jesus indicated Judas and at the same time told him to go away, and Judas got up from the table and went off and no one hindered him.Then Jesus said: This is what it means to exalt the son of man.

To exalt the son of man is to be as kind as the Father not only to those who love us but to all men, even to those who do us harm.Therefore do not argue about my teaching, do not pick it to pieces as the Orthodox do, but do as I do and as I have now done before your eyes.This one commandment I give you: love men.My whole teaching is to love men always and to the end.After this, fear came over Jesus, and he went in the dark with his pupils to a garden to be out of the way.And on the road he said to them: You are all of you wavering and timid; if they come to take me you will all run away.To this Peter replied: No, I will never desert you and will defend you even to the death.And the other pupils all said the same.Then Jesus said: If that is so, then prepare for defence, get weapons to defend yourselves and collect your provisions, for we shall have to hide.The pupils replied that they had two knives.When Jesus heard the mention of knives, anguish came over him.And going to a lonely spot he began to pray and urged the pupils to do the same, but they did not understand him.Jesus said: My Father—the spirit!End in me this struggle with temptation.Confirm me in the fulfilment of Thy will.I want to overcome my own wish to defend my bodily life, and to do Thy will—not resisting evil.The pupils still did not understand.And he said to them: Do not consider the body, but try to exalt the spirit in yourselves; strength is in the spirit, but the flesh is weak.And again he said: My Father!If suffering must be, then let it come: but in the suffering I want one thing only, that not my will, but Thine, may be fulfilled in me.The pupils did not understand.Summarization models summary:

And again he strove with temptation and at last overcame it; and coming to his pupils he said: Now it is decided, you can be at rest.I shall not fight, but shall give myself up into the hands of the men of this world.XI
AND Jesus, feeling himself prepared for death, went to give himself up, but Peter stopped him and asked where he was going.Jesus replied: I am going where you cannot go.I am ready for death, but you are not yet ready for it.Peter said: I am ready to give my life for you now.Jesus replied: A man cannot pledge himself to anything.And he said to all his pupils: I know that death awaits me, but I believe in the life of the Father and therefore do not fear it.Do not be disturbed at my death, but believe in the true God and Father of life, and then my death will not seem dreadful to you.If I am united to the Father of life, then I cannot be deprived of life.It is true that I do not tell you what or where my life after death will be, but I point out to you the way to true life.My teaching does not tell you what that life is to be, but it reveals the only true path to that life, which is to be in unity with the Father.The Father is the source of life.My teaching is that man should live in the will of the Father and fulfil His will for the life and welfare of all men.Your teacher when I am gone will be your knowledge of the truth.In fulfilling my teaching you will always feel that you are in the truth and that the Father is in you and you in the Father.And knowing the Father of life in yourselves, you will experience a peace nothing can deprive you of.And therefore if you know the truth and live in it, neither my death nor your own can alarm you.

Men think of themselves as separate beings each with his own separate will to live, but that is only an illusion.The only true life is that which recognizes the Father's will as the source of life.My teaching reveals this oneness of life, and presents life not as separate growths but as one tree on which all the branches grow.Only he lives who lives in the Father's will like a branch on its parent tree: he who wishes to live by his own will dies like a branch that has been torn away.The Father gave me life to do good, and I have taught you to live to do good.If you fulfil my commandments you will be blessed, and the commandment which sums up my whole teaching is simply that all men should love one another.And love is to sacrifice the bodily life for the sake of another: there is no other definition.And in fulfilling my law of love you will not fulfil it like slaves who obey their master's orders without understanding them; but you will live as free men like myself, for I have made clear to you the purpose of life flowing from a knowledge of the Father of life.You have received my teaching not because you accidentally chose it, but because it is the only truth by which men are made free.The teaching of the world is that men should do evil to one another, but my teaching is that they should love one another.Therefore the world will hate you as it has hated me.The world does not understand my teaching and therefore will persecute you and do you harm, thinking to serve God by so doing.Do not be surprised at this, but understand that it must be so.The world, not understanding the true God, must persecute you, but you must affirm the truth.You are distressed at their killing me, but they kill me for declaring the truth, and my death is necessary for the confirmation of the truth.Summarization models summary:

My death, at which I do not recede from the truth, will strengthen you, and you will understand what is false and what is true and what results from a knowledge of falsehood and of truth.You will understand that it is falsehood for men to believe in the bodily life and not in the life of the spirit, and that truth consists in unity with the Father from which results the victory of the spirit over the flesh.When I am no longer with you in the bodily life, my spirit will be with you; but like all men you will not always feel within you the strength of the spirit.Sometimes you will weaken and lose the strength of the spirit and fall into temptation, and sometimes you will again awaken to the true life.Hours of bondage to the flesh will come upon you, but only for a time; you will suffer and be again restored to the spirit as a woman suffers in childbirth and then feels joy that she has brought a human being into the world.You will experience the same when after being enslaved by the body you again rise in spirit, and feel such joy that there will be nothing more for you to desire.Know this in advance: in despite of persecution, of inward struggle and depression of spirit, the spirit lives within you and the one true God is the knowledge of the Father's will that I have revealed.And addressing the Father, the spirit, Jesus said: I have done what Thou commandedst me, and have revealed to men that Thou art the source of all things, and they have understood me.I have taught them that they all come from one source of infinite life and that therefore they are all one, and that as the Father is in me and I am in the Father, so they, too, are one with me and the Father.I have revealed to them also that as Thou in love hast sent them into the world, they too should serve the world by love.XII


WHEN Jesus had finished speaking to his pupils, he rose and, instead of running away or defending himself, went to meet Judas who was bringing soldiers to take him.Jesus went to him and asked him why he had come.But Judas did not answer and a crowd of soldiers came round Jesus.Peter rushed to defend him and, drawing a knife, began to fight.But Jesus stopped him and told him to give up the knife, saying that he who fights with a knife himself perishes by a knife.Then he said to those who had come to take him: I have till now gone about among you alone without fear, and I feel no fear now, I give myself up to you to do with me as you please.And all his pupils ran away and deserted him.Then the officer of the soldiers ordered Jesus to be bound and taken to Annas, a former high priest who lived in the same house as Caiaphas, who was high priest that year and who had devised the pretext upon which it was decided to kill Jesus: namely, that if he were not killed the whole nation would perish.Jesus, feeling himself in the will of the Father, was ready for death and did not resist when they took him, and was not afraid when they led him away; but that very Peter who had just assured Jesus that he would rather die than renounce him, the same Peter who had tried to defend Jesus, now when he saw Jesus being led to execution was afraid they would execute him too, and when the door-keeper asked whether he had not been with Jesus, denied him and deserted him.Only later, when the cock crowed, did Peter understand all that Jesus had said to him.He understood that there are two temptations of the flesh—fear and strife—and that Jesus had resisted these when he prayed in the garden and asked the pupils to pray.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
And now he, Peter, had yielded to both these temptations against which Jesus had warned him: he had tried to resist evil, and to defend the truth had been ready to fight and do evil himself; and now in fear of bodily suffering he had renounced his master.Jesus had not yielded either to the temptation to fight when the pupils had two knives ready for his defence, or to the temptation of fear—first before the people in Jerusalem when the heathen wished to speak to him, and now before the soldiers when they bound him and led him to trial.Jesus was brought before Caiaphas, who began to question him about his teaching.But knowing that Caiaphas asked not to find out about his teaching but only to convict him, Jesus did not reply, but said: I have concealed nothing and conceal nothing now: if you wish to know what my teaching is, ask those who heard it and understood it.For this answer the high priest's servant struck Jesus on the cheek.Jesus asked why he struck him, but the man did not answer him and the high priest continued the trial.Witnesses were brought and gave evidence that Jesus had boasted that he would destroy the Jewish faith.And the high priest questioned Jesus, but seeing that they did not ask in order to learn anything, but only to pretend that it was a just trial, he answered nothing.Then the high priest asked him: Tell me, are you Christ, a son of God?Jesus said: Yes, I am Christ, a son of God; and now in torturing me you will see how the son of man resembles God.The high priest was glad to hear these words and said to the other judges: Are not these words enough to condemn him?And the judges said: They are enough: we sentence him to death.And when they said this, the people threw themselves upon Jesus and began to strike him, to spit in his face, and to insult him.He remained silent.

The Jews had not the right to put anyone to death: to do this permission was needed from the Roman governor.So having condemned Jesus in their court, and having subjected him to ignominy, they took him to the Roman governor Pilate that he might order his execution.Pilate asked why they wished to put Jesus to death, and they answered that he was a criminal.Pilate said that if that was so, they should judge him by their own law.They answered: We want you to put him to death, because he is guilty before the Roman Caesar: he is a rebel, he agitates the people, forbids them to pay taxes to Caesar, and calls himself the King of the Jews.Pilate called Jesus before him, and said: What is the meaning of this—are you King of the Jews?Jesus said: Do you really wish to know what my kingdom is, or are you only asking me for form's sake?Pilate answered: I am not a Jew, and it is the same to me whether you call yourself King of the Jews or not, but I ask you who you are and why do they call you a king?Jesus replied: They say truly that I call myself a king.I am indeed a king, but my kingdom is not an earthly one, it is a heavenly one.Earthly kings have armies and go to war and fight, but as you see they have bound and beaten me and I did not resist.I am a heavenly king and my power is in the spirit.Pilate said: So it is true that you consider yourself a king?Jesus replied: You know it yourself.Everyone who lives by the spirit is free.I live by this alone, and teach only to show men the truth—that they are free if they live by the spirit.Pilate said: You teach the truth, but nobody knows what truth is.Everyone has his own truth.Summarization models summary:

And having said this he turned away from Jesus and went back again to the Jews, and said: I find nothing criminal in this man.Why do you wish me to put him to death?The chief priests said: He ought to be executed because he stirs up the people.Then Pilate began to examine Jesus before the chief priests, but Jesus, seeing that this was only for form's sake, answered nothing.Then Pilate said: I alone cannot condemn him.Take him to Herod.At the trial before Herod, Jesus again did not answer the chief priests' accusations, and Herod, taking Jesus to be an empty fellow, mockingly ordered him to be dressed in a red cloak and sent back to Pilate.Pilate pitied Jesus and began to persuade the chief priests to forgive him, if only on account of the feast; but they held to their demand, and they all, and the people with them, cried out to have Jesus crucified.Pilate again tried to persuade them to let Jesus go, but the priests and the people cried out that he must be executed.They said: He is guilty of calling himself a son of God.Pilate again called Jesus to him, and asked.What does it mean that you call yourself a son of God?Who are you?Jesus answered nothing.Then Pilate said: How is it that you do not answer me, when I have the power to execute you or to set you free?Jesus replied: You have no power over me.All power is from above.And Pilate for the third time tried to persuade the Jews to set Jesus free, but they said to him: If you will not execute this man whom we have denounced as a rebel against Caesar, then you yourself are not a friend to Caesar, but a foe.And on hearing these words Pilate gave way and ordered the execution of Jesus.But they first stripped Jesus and flogged him, and then dressed him again in the red cloak.

And they beat him and insulted him and mocked him.Then they gave him a cross to carry and led him to the place of execution, and there they nailed him to the cross, and as he hung on the cross the people all mocked at him.And to this mockery Jesus answered: Father, do not punish them for this, they do not know what they are doing.And later, when he was already near to death, he said: My Father!Into Thy care I yield my spirit.And bowing his head he breathed his last.About this digital edition
