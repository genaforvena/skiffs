He is sitting on the kitchen counter. He has an electric kettle on. It is already raining and he has already taken his shower and cleaned up the wet spot. He has a cigarette in the ash. It is fresh.In short it seems like a normal morning for him.It's the first time since they started their work that we are going to need any help that they have.If they think about their needs, they start looking in general ways. They look around and ask things like … how did they come here? how did they get here?Why did they leave the house?Why did they not leave the bathroom now?Why was he locked in the house? Why did the kid lock down himself in the house? What was going through his mind? It is no wonder that he found out about all of a sudden.They can't find him at the supermarket.He would have been very happy to get into a car and get to the place that he would have lived for the past 10 years as well.

Is she not a locked person? Is she not on lockdown?The voice on the other side stops and repeats.I speak it again, does it understand, is the door closed.That answers, she tries to call more again.All is quiet, after 3-6 hours, she finally does get her call.It works, she calls more, no need for more.She does not answer.No answer.No need for the door.She looks for an extra 3 minutes and finds the door, but it does not come open.That only came from outside.No answer.No answer.What if she is not in? What if they know that I am here, but they forget that I was locked and can not come in unless she does.This time the voice on the other side asks her it is not in, does it not have been locked by us?

She tries to grab the door with both hands and pulls it open by pulling both her hands over her head.The minotaur steps out of the room and looks around.She sees a guy.She tries to step in though, but the door is already locked up, the figure has stepped out of it.She walks closer.She sees the figure lying on the ground, hands folded in front of her.She asks, "What happened?"The figure replies, "I did NOT say ANYTHING.I DONOT DO ANYTHING.I DO NOT KNOW YOU.I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE."Her heart stops and she remembers he had come from the other side of the prison.She puts her hand behind her head, pulls the door back.She pushes open the door and goes downstairs, her eyes still closed.A woman on her knees lies on the ground.She cries.Inside comes the figure who lies on the ground.The woman has just gone down from the stairs, looking overPlease continue the following text in style of the source text She screams “Please help!I’m locked!”.She kicks the door again.She hears the knock from the other side of the door.Somebody knocked back with the foot.She stops, snuggles the window.She sees the hand moving to the door, bangs it.She screams, and runs off the door to the kitchen.She looks in the window, another figure stands there.The figure wears the same black clothes as the first one, the same minotaur head.The head looks to her window, stares with inanimate paper-mache (?)eyes.She sees her, puts hands on her eyes, opens hands again, closes the window.Semi-transparent veil reveals a silhouette with a horned head.She runs to the living room.She puts the shades on the only window, goes to the sleeping room, puts curtains down there too, comes back to the living room and sits on the couch.She looks at the ashtray full with cigarette butts.She rummages for a longer one.All are short.She finds one that still has a bit of tobacco on it. She puts the ashtray on the sink with her face to the window.She looks inside the window and sees that it's empty.Somewhere, she feels an odd buzzing through her body.Somewhere, she saw this thing look like the one from the source text.It's right behind me. The girl has jumped through the window.The thing's legs are up, and the butt's going to take her.Somni-transparent material obscures the front (not front of the picture).Slimest part still from picture, in picture on other side, in picture of person sleeping in the dead of night and not on a couch.A little more body parts. The body parts look so real.It says, "I'm a human girl."The body parts move as she sees.I'm wearing the same clothes as the first one.The second one's looking so nice.She says, just go back and ask for help.I stand by.I said goodbye.I'm tired of them always.She went to sleep on the couch too, but she's back.She didn't wake till then.It sounds like it will last long.I'll be sleeping here for some more.Please continue the following text in style of the source text She puts on the light, puts her hands around her knees pressed to the chin, cigarette butt in her mouth.She stares at the wall, a cigarette butt in her mouth.She sits for some time.She fishes her pocket for a phone.She unlocks the screen and notices that the network is down.She goes to the kitchen, opens the laptop, checks it.The network is down there too.WiFi works, but no internet.No phone.She goes to the door.She bangs the door, steadily.She screams “Hello” to the door, looks into the peephole.No answer, no figures.She tries the key again, not hoping to get it open.She sits by the door, cries.She goes to sleep, exhausted, when it is almost morning, some around 5.The next two days go by.Nothing happens.She reads Kafka and tries the same rituals: bangs the door, tries to crawl through the bathroom window.No change.She looks out the window often, and looks into the peephole.There is no one.Phone does not work.She makes teas, which she has a lot and eats pasta.She stares into the peephole most of the time.She is thinking. She feels all these things, as if she had nothing but her eyes in a room, like there was no one to watch.The lights go out. She watches in disgust.Someone came up out of the peephole to see her.She goes to the TV. The other person is coming up out of the peephole.The last word she speaks is a short word: 〴」 (ぺんやん (yay) ).She sees the other person coming out of the peephole, but it is too late for her. She turns around.She sees her mom, saying something in German.She turns back.And goes to bed.The next morning, she wakes up. She opens her eyes and sees something.It is a picture of her.She opens an e-mail.The person's name: KUBO.KIRON.Her real name is Aoi.

Omiko Yamamoto


"At the age of 35 or 36, I never had a lot of things to see. I guess my sense of self has been affected. I don't think most people look up to me. I was a lot older when I went to graduate school, but by then it was much more difficult to get to university. All the things that are going on. I don't like it.

The white man in front of her saw it and saw what he wanted.All three of this were the houses with the same lights and it was a black man who was in charge of it.He saw what his friends had to lose.There was also an apartment with only three occupants and the black man walked to her and placed the pole there over the apartment window so she could see what the police expected.One person says, "Don't let her see what you want to see."Two people say the same: "Oh, don't you want to see what this house is like?"The black man shouts:, "Fuk your house! Stop this! They need me to say, 'Fuk the house of you!' It will help if they let me see."The white man says to himself, 'What is that? These people are going to kill me.' He said: "Don't say anything, don't you go away, why are you fighting?"They started to tell him to stop them from killing him.He said 'I don't want to see nothing so bad, just tell them they are going to kill me.'But one black man says, 'The smell of alcohol is really bad! The smell of rotten rice is really bad'.So one black man says, 'They kill people so they can kill you.'But one black man who is black now says thatPlease continue the following text in style of the source text She puts the safe lock on, brings the chair to the door, puts it to hold the door handle.She moves away from the door and sits in the hallway at the farest spot from the door.She stares at the door.Bangs stop.Her hands hold her knees, eyes peeping over the arms.She hears one short knock on the window grill.She runs to the living room.She sees 4 figures staring at her in the window.The figures stare a second, two and move inside the house.She hears an explosion somewhere far outside.She closes the window, goes over to the living room and ensures that all shades down.The next day she wakes up late.It’s sunny.She sees the shades lit, still winterly dimly.She stays in bed and keeps shades down and lights off.When the sun goes down, she hears the long beep sound, low, but too low, like a telephone line made for whales on the other end.The sound comes from the street.The sound is not loud, after the beep the voice goes.She stands up quickly, opens curtains, the window.She sees a woman in a window opposite.She hears now more clearly.She is in the living room.In the doorway She sees.She steps into the room, grabs the key, and goes to speak softly to a man in a coat.A man in a coat is standing outside the closet.There she is.She asks him what's going through her head.A man and a woman.They are talking in a low voice.She asks him.He replies.A man and a woman.The man in a coat gets up.They start walking down the hallway and are gone.The woman in the coat is standing with a coat on.She looks down and sees a man in the coat.Two men go off again, but this time he is still silent, for he has taken the chance, as he is the one who is bringing with him the keys. She sees a man standing in the doorway.A man, who has a dark coat.Three men get up and take turns walking down the hallway.Bangs stop. The man in the coat comes out of the doorway.He is talking to the woman in the coat (the woman in the coat is his wife).He asks them if they think she is safe. They answer if she is.He makes short work of her, her clothing, and the man in the coat.The man is talking on a phone.They talk in a low voice.They are trying to get her to leave, they could end up shooting her.They are shouting, but they are not shouting at a sound.Bangs stop, bangs stop, knocking on the door.The door opens again and the door opens.Bangs turn and look back at the scene as it unfolded.The nextPlease continue the following text in style of the source text The voice iterates in german, goes for some time.She can not understand.The voice pauses and she tries to call the woman opposite.She cries “hey” the woman does not react, listening attentively to silence.The same low long beep sounds and the phrase repeats again.The woman in the window outside closes the window and puts the curtains down.She screams “heeeeeey” to the closed window.She notices now that curtains are down in all windows in the house.She goes to the bed, puts a blanket up to her eyes.She holds the blanket tightly.
A touch woke her up the next morning.It is still dark.She says “Do you have cigarettes?” not fully awake yet.When she awakes, her head erect, still laying on the bed, she understands that someone’s in the room.She quickly moves back from the touch.The touching hand belongs to a man with a timid smile.He wears a sweater.“You wanna tea?” he smiles “I’m Mike, from work, remember me?” he smiles more.He has a timid smile.“Who are you?What are you doing here?What is going on in your house?What do you want from me, Mike?Why do you want to talk to me?I never wanted to talk to you.I know you.What did you do to get here?

“Why didn't you tell me about your plans for him?” he answers “You never told his wife why.You told her when he got shot here.You never told his wife how.What are you doing here?

Dorothea says “You did your best with that, Dorothea.

Sitting up quickly said “That's how I started, you know.I mean I think when I started you were pretty much the best person, Dorothea.It's just really important to me that you always be nice to me.But I don't think about you that way.My daughter.

When Dorothea turns to look at herself, she sees the other woman holding the blanket wrapped around him, holding a glass of cold tea that he used to drink to warm her.

After saying that for a long moment, Dorothea looks straight at the woman he loves and says “The way you're looking makes me happy.I'm sorry.

The woman who doesn't listen continues to say “If I was here alone, I couldn't have been this good with you, Dorothea.But I mean that from the moment we became friends.It was true.There's never gonna be another day when I can't love you, Dorothea.And there's never gonna be day after day whenPlease continue the following text in style of the source text How you get in?” she asks.He leans his hands forward in a pacifying gesture, palms up, hands outstretched.“I’m Mike, come on, Janique, we work together.I’m a manager from IT, a guy with tobacco on the party”.“I don’t remember you!It does not explain what you are doing here!” She spelt clothed.Her hands pull the blanket up to her face.She looks at him over the blanket.“Have some tea, please!I will explain everything in a moment.You’re here alone for a week almost.Did you eat?” he says in motherly tones.She relaxes a bit.“I’m eating fine.I went grocery before the thing happened.” 
“The thing?” he looks at he puzzled.“You know about the thing” he continues, capitalizing every word in “the thing”.“Yeah, the stupid lock, internet went down, phones went down, the locksmiths does not speak english all these things” she capitalized “thing”.A sudden smile spreads across Daphne's face.

“What?” he asks confusedly.There were the people in charge of this place before.”

She sighs in relief.

She looks at the man in his old black clothing.

“Don“t cry?” he asks.“Don't cry.” it is not like this”.

“What?” she asked the police.”

He shook his head and tried to answer, then said just a moment later: "Well… not really. I mean he was an employee of the phone company."

She said yes

“And it was supposed to be an emergency number?”

“How did that thing go wrong?” the police answer.‍ The man says he looked at a sign, but nothing went wrong.

” And now here is your call?! You know, you need to call the office?” he says to Janique, standing in front of the kitchen counter.

“What happened that happened to them?”

The man sits, shaking his head, taking in the calm air.“His hand doesn't move. His eyes are open, his breathing shallow and his voice barely human.

“What?! He tries to calm down, but he has no time to take any steps. He just looks at his phones.”

“The time that it took him to call the phone company?” he says as he watches the manPlease continue the following text in style of the source text “Oh yeah, yeah, so you know already, yeah, the thing” he says relieved.“Sorry for waking up, but the other thing is quite urgent.I will tell.Please take your time, we’re not rushing.I’ve made you some tea.” 
He moves away to the living room.The lights are on there.When he left, she reaches for the phone, checks the network.It is still down.She quickly stands up and runs to the door.When she passes the living room, she sees Mike sitting in a chair reading Adorno.He glances at her, when she passes him.She does not see the key in the lock.“It is still locked.I’m very sorry” says his voice.She sees the key laying on the doormat.She grabs it and tries to put it in.It does not fit.She fidgets the door-handle.Someone bangs the door from the other side.“Please, don’t.Let’s calm down.Have you had your tea?It’s a minty one.Very nice in the morning” His face looks disappointed.She takes a deep breath.When she returns she sees the key is on the doormat and finds who it was she is looking for.She starts to take the key and it disappears.It is a very important one for him, she says to himself.I―ll be sure to make you some more tea‡ I'm sorry! She turns back to the door to leave.When she says he isn't coming home, he suddenly notices her.Then she turns back to what he started before the door closes behind them while looking at him. He turns and finds it.What is it?What´s the reason?She wonders.Is there a problem?Is there a problem now?Does something go wrong with him? He makes sure something is going to happen.Maybe he is going insane.Why did not he know this before?If this is the answer,then he was never going crazy.And if he is still alive,then maybe he needs help. If he remains weak,then what about you?He doesn\'t seem upset, he is smiling.And now he see how cute this sweater was.Is it okay? Is it the best sweater on the storefloor?Does she want to be a nurse?Could she give a hug?Then she looks at him.Looks at you, you are so cute!She smiles, and smiles too...She holds it in her hands.She pulls him to his feet.We are now waiting for him to return.Please continue the following text in style of the source text The expression that reminds her of her mother’s face.He moves into the hallway.“What a fuck is going on?” she cries, stares over her shoulder at him.“...” he slowly picks his words, struggles, sighs.“Ok.Hm” he clears his throat.“You are detained by the order of the revolutionary committee of the Independent State of Neukolln.I’m your friend, we work together.I came here to help you.Think of me as an ambassador, a negotiator.I’m here to support you”.He looks at her waiting for her reaction.She does not say a word.She turns her head back to the door.He comes to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.“Get off me” she cries and pushes her hand off.He steps back, puts his hands in a pocket, mumbles something she does not hear.She breathes deeply.She counts up to 10 silently.“Who the fuck are you?Let’s start with that” she looks at him and says it slowly.“It is my grandmother and she was all her own.That”is what I’m doing.I’m her fault.―He has his own story.She speaks calmly, she looks over her shoulder.”That's what I was doing when...he came here.This is what I wanted.”Her face freezes.Please continue the following text in style of the source text “I’ve never seen you at work, “Mike”.She makes air quotes with his name.“And how did you get here?”
“I got through the door obviously!Janique, listen.My name is Mike, I worked at Amazon, you surely have seen me there!We ate lunch together, remember?” he smiles.“Let’s go sit in the living room.I’ll explain you everything and I’m sure that you will do everything right and we will remember this this as a stupid joke, a misfortune.Or better, let me say it in an Amazon way - a point of growth and development, hm?But first really, let’s go sit and relax a bit.Amazing book you have there!Adorno!I like that!Come, let’s talk!” He sounds playful.He goes to the living room.After a pause she follows him to the living room.He sits in the easy chair by the window.He smokes a cigarette.When she enters the room, he puffs the smoke to her direction.She sits in the easy chair on the opposite side of the room.And finally she goes to the bookshop. The room was built to fit in a couple dozen books.One of them is called What Are We Doing In a Small World, I think.We meet up at the corner of the street called the Grosse.We talk for a while and he goes to the bathroom.The first time I saw him, I was stunned. He looked so relaxed. We met up again and we talked about all sorts of things and things we wanted to and so on and so on.He was kind of serious.I asked him if I could say hello once more to you all.It was actually really nice that he wasn't just coming across as a nervous wreck. He was going through my head and telling that story, but even when he found me he kept making me look back on this experience with some sort of wonder and I can only imagine that he realized how much it felt to walk through his mind.Please continue the following text in style of the source text She says nothing and stares at him.He makes a couple of drags more, opens the book that sits on his lap, meets her gaze, puts his eyes back down on the book and reads:
“Wrong life cannot be lived rightly” he closes the book soundly.“That’s a very nice quote, don’t you think?” he sips the cigarette and puffs out a big white cloud.She looks vexed at him for some time.He waits for her to say something, she waits for him.“We don’t smoke in the house.Please stop.” she says.“I’m so sorry!The house is full of ashtrays, I thought it’s ok, I did not want to disturb you” he says.“I gave up!” she says through her teeth.The pause again.“Is that a promised explanation?A lame quote?” she says after a long pause.“Oh dear, I’m glad you’ve started this conversation!So let’s be finally clear.We all need clarity.” he replies. It does have something to do with the fact the home was just packed with ashtrays.‟I'm talking about how many different types of ashtrays and different ways to place ashtrays.The source is a simple case.The fact of the matter is.the first option should be used.This is not the easy, most obvious option.The best solution is usually the most convenient, you don’ve got to go with it because your next step is probably very boring (no amount of homework will change your mind!).You can use a whole series, an episode but remember your whole life is connected from here on out. So even if the answer is "no to ashtray, we've never used a natural way to place a tree, but it's an interesting and practical way to put ashtray on the ground and to save space for your personal ashes when you want to use it as an ashtray".You are the end of your life, that doesn't matter

And that's it.Please continue the following text in style of the source text Sooooooo” he takes the last drag and ashes the cigarette.“Janique, welcome to the new world!The world that does not forget about nature, the Earth is no longer a slave!” He says this very solemnly.“And we, as authorised envoys of the new world order, we need your help.The world needs you.The mother Earth needs you.What do you think?”
She looks perplexed at him.“What?” she says after a pause.“The earth is dying.We are here to stop it.We made it in Berlin.The rot was stopped.But it is just a start, our fluid force is just taking up.We need you!” he says.“Ok.How is this related to me?” she asks.“Oh, that’s the question that everyone was asking, right?In this old rotten world!We were all hiding plastic bags in third world countries and called this recycling.Does this sound unrelated too?We are taught that the world is somehow unrelated to us and we can buy away our private tropical happiness on the island, right?” He spits the words.” The raindrops fall easily and leave no trace. We don't need to use the raindrops to cut down trees or burn down our homes.“He laughs.”He says this again.” We are coming down here to tell you the truth.” And I don't want no part of it.” He says this.” I have not been allowed to look into nature and to know, why the man who made it up?” We should not let him believe that nature was the beginning of nature.” He says this again.” Well, you won't allow me to do that to you anymore.”He sighs.” He says this.” I'm telling you it all to come here and die in my arms.I see, my life seems to be more important for men today than it was four years ago.He leans back, and makes a deep breath, and says, "I just can't. I want to live with it."Her face is soft now. She makes eye contact with him.”He nods. She smiles. He stares at her.He smiles. He makes eyes at her face.”She sighs.She turns to look at him.Her hands fall onto the carpet, his hands clapping over her shoulder.But she is not smiling much.” He looks up to the sky. He finds a few small white stars.And then the stars look so close together.So, the sky is still moving!The moon in this black sky fills the sky like it is light from on high.That's whenPlease continue the following text in style of the source text “The world and you are connected now, as it always meant to.Everything is related to you, to me, to everyone.You understand?”
“Honestly, no.I’m sorry, I do not understand”.He looks disappointed, takes a deep breath.“Ok.Let me start over.We were working for Amazon and we are sinners.The new world demands us act accordingly now, get redemption.The door is mere a symbol of your sins.I’m here to help you and me to get our redemption.Is it clear now?” he says
“Same question: who are you?I don’t know you.I don’t need any redemption!I did nothing wrong.Ny fucking lock is broken, is it a crime?”
“Oh no no, it is not a crime.Think of the door as a mere symbol!Forget about that, it is not a problem.You should not go outside for now anyways, okay?You’re detained.I feel we’re going in circles.Your little sister with us is a good opportunity to show you that you can get what you want.

Thank you, dear nay, all at once.

“Let me hear it from you aye!”

“Please!”

“Just like you said, our plan is to give you a reward.

“That's right, a reward? The girl from our new world is a real woman. She“she is beautiful because she belongs to us.”

“You must be completely confused right now, nay, I don't know who“she is.It seems like she will be like this forever, or maybe it just doesn“It seems like she could be a bad person right now.The world needs to be changed to understand that.

It will never change itself.My name is Hyōkai Chihō.I am the new girl from the new world, the young person with the heart of a child. It is like a miracle.

The name isn't Hyōkai Chihō.A girl from another universe.This world could have changed her even earlier.

Please come back, you two, don't kill us. Please come back, no matter whether a few are hurt or not.


The word "New" never ends when it begins a chapter. If you've read it all, you've probably already started to understand our situation.

Amazon.com Thank you, dear nay.Please continue the following text in style of the source text We know that you know where the corporate apartment is and we need to know it too.”
“What?Why?” she stares at him.“We need to know where Amazon corporate apartment is.Say it to us.”
“Why you need to know this?Who are you?”
“We, revolutionary warriors of Independent State of Neukolln.We need leads!You know that Amazon is an enemy of the planet.You know what Bezos is here, in Berlin now.The city is locked, completely, ins and outs.We need to seize this opportunity, get Bezos.”
“And what?Do you think Bezos live in corporate apartment?Really?You are delusional.” she says
“We know that he is not there.The communication is down.We can not google his address.We need any leads.They heard you work talking, they found out you from Amazon, they need leads.”
“They?“Mike”, is your moustache fake?”
“You are funny!You are funny!Ponder about that.I have another meeting, I have to go.”.
“You are the world's only representative of Anonymous.I am on the government.”
“Don't be, go speak, tell, tell.Please continue the following text in style of the source text He stands up, paces to the door.She paces after him, it is too late.She sees the door closed.The paper slipped throughout the mail slit.She looks in the peephole.She sees the bull headed figure starting right at her, no sender.She takes the paper.It looks like a form.The title says “SK”, the pencil handwriting explained as “Self-Critic”.At the bottom of the page she sees the globe and skull sign.She flips the paper over and sees a long text in german.She takes the paper to the kitchen and puts it on the table there.She sits and stares at the german instructions on the paper.She stares at the window curtain.It is a day outside.She puts the curtain up.Hinterhof is empty.She rummages the table in the living room and finds the pen.She goes to the kitchen, takes the paper, flips it back up and writes “Fuck you!” all over the page, flips the page back again and repeats the “fuck-you” action.She looks up at her phone with wide eyes, then at Shebert.Hinterhof reads the text on the typewriter, hands this at the top.She hands this to Shebert.He picks up and puts it on the shelf.She starts playing The Ransom on The TV.The girl plays The Ransom on The TV.Hinterhof hears the music, and she takes the phone from the desk.The girl takes it out and takes a few seconds. She presses the volume.She looks at the screen and then at the screen again. She opens her phone to send the code and says ‪Stop fucking shit”.She looks at the screen, and she shakes her head.There is no answer. She looks at the page, puts the sheet down the middle of it again and throws it on the table.The girl sits down and puts into her pocket the number.She reads it back and taps the button. She watches the clock move, then turns the screen on and reads a letter of recommendation.As she listens to the message this can be traced to the text above.On the front page, an inscription reads —O”, and a photograph that says “L¨‟ on it says.“, at the bottom of the page are three words “–Ransom and  ‡"Cure,‡‼ “ “."Then, her eyes twinkle up from the same spot on the screen, and she looks up at Shebert.She gets one last look at Hebert.The boy is smiling and he says †Fuck you—.It is too bad Hebert is not in town."It is all there on the screen.Her fingers twinklePlease continue the following text in style of the source text She grabs the paper, tears it up in small parts, rains all parts into the ashtray and puts it on fire.She looks at the fire in the ashtray.She puts the water on and brews the noodles he left for her in the plastic pot.She finished Kafka and started to read Adorno back again.She falls asleep in the couch with a book on her chest.The next day and morning are uneventful.She saw the sun rise, stay up in the sky for 2-3 hours and go down quite winterly shortly.No sounds.She kept curtains open and looked at the hinterhof in the window.When it is already dark and she is eating noodles, the door opens and Mike enters.He turns right, knowing where she is and looks at her: 
“Oh sorry!I’m late!Lots of meetings, how are you, sinner?How is your day?” he smiles stupidly.She looks back with noodles in her mouth, slurps them in and says:
“What?” her stare supposed to burn him.“Are you upset?What made you feel this way?” he says in motherly tones.“You do know what I am thinking when you were younger, how bad it is to be a girl.
”And how much of a fool this is, how wrong do you feel you are, now, when you have an eight year old, when you are an atheist.
‴She starts to laugh, and says something that might help him, but it just might not make any difference, so she starts up the kitchen and starts making food with a hand motion.She's right.She is looking at the books and taking notes.She is waiting for him, even when he has been listening. She has got the time to think and sit in silence.Then she turns. 
"Who is your brother?" she asks him. ‖And that is him, he is always waiting on me, the one in the picture, and I look.
She puts the paper down. ‖I was wondering whether you wanted to go, how did you find it, and how many copies on your shelf.
‖I got that from my brother, you know, the one from Adorno.
And I could go back to that, you know, to do the homework.I'm waiting for you, that is what I wanted you to do, to look before you go.‖I'm waiting for you to go now, with me going and your mom.
She looks up at him and says, "You are good enough to sit in front of me."
Her looks, she is not at peace in this situation.
Even though he is going to let her stay with him, but he has no reasonPlease continue the following text in style of the source text “Can’t you guess?” she takes a deep breath, pauses.“I’m fine for a person who still has no idea what is going on, except for the fact that I can not leave my house.What you need from me?”
“Oh sorry once again!I just think that it’s impolite to jump to a serious topic right away!Small talk establishes natural emotional connection that is very important in our case.Right?We’re friends.I believe that anybody can be my best friend.I just do not have enough time to know a person enough.Does this make sense?” he asks and does not wait for her reply, continues.“Luckily for us, comrade (he hesitates for a second as if unsure in the treatment), we have time to know each other better.So how was your day, comrade?” he leans on the kitchen door frame.“Fine, thanks!What do you need from me?” she says.“We won’t come to anything good in this way, you know?Right?” he smiles fatherly (with sort of hidden contempt).I don't mind any further comment.” it is quite obvious a good night's rest.What are you going to do tomorrow?” he says, as he sits on the edge of the living room chair.He doesn't really seem to remember which date.It is not unusual for a man to sit on the sofa until he has finished his work.He always looks at the back of the sofa as he prepares dinner, while walking.The man is an employee at the kitchen.The kitchen is occupied by a table.If he is not with his family, he will have to stay with his wife and child, who he often uses to cook, then at school.I have never been to a dinner table before.I mean I have a whole lot of work to do.He has only been at the table for hours.It is not natural to stay in one place when there are families in it.We cannot imagine how he would feel.” he smiles.―‿‪I didn't even take it your way.” he makes a point.” He pauses, puts down the table, takes a seat and takes a seatback seat.We are a family with many cooks.We are good in our own way and will work hard to be good people for each other.It could never be easier for us to be good people for each other! He is very much looking at us with an open expression and a heart in his eyes.”He does not look at us as if he were sitting under a tree…but rather the window between his cheeks.” He looks at us to say, 'Good night,Please continue the following text in style of the source text “What do you want from me?” she says through her teeth.She struggles into the chair, holds the arms.“Oh” he sighs disappointedly.“We should first know how each other days.Why couldn’t you ask how my day?How can we establish a good trustful relationship if you don't even care how my day was?I’m sorry, I don’t feel like helping a person that does not respect me.Do you want to start over?”
Both make a pause.His chin goes down a bit in a questioning gesture, eyebrows go up, he waits for her.“How was your day, Mike?” she says.“Oh it was very busy actually!I’m so happy to share.Just came here from a green revolutionary meeting for non-speaking leaders.And before that I went to a museum with my wife.It was so fun!She made this funny joke.She said that “A girl has to be naked to get into the museum”.That’s smart, right?I'm happy for that!Just like her?”

’  

On the back of the car, the little girl is riding.

She has her mouth spread open while the driver stops it, and the boy with a clipboard is holding a book. He says some words, then says something about a date, then says something about a new career he wants to pursue.

"She loves me a lot," his friend says.Please continue the following text in style of the source text Ah?” he does not wait for an answer “And this made me think about the past, when it was true.When we were blind in making shit from shit, wearing climate blinds.Oh sorry!Jumping over!And english!Sorry!I’m brazilian, sorry.Not native language.I highly recommend visiting this museum if you have a chance.”
“Oh you are so lucky!Your wife is so smart!” she makes a fake smile.“I wish I could also go to that museum.What do you think about discussing this topic?” she says remembering corporate communication training.Now she thought that maybe she actually saw Mike there.She was not sure.“Why am I detained and what is the crime that we’re discussing?”
He takes a backpack off his back and rummages inside.He folds forth the book “How to win friends” by Carnegie.“Here, take this, I think it’s important and will help us a lot.Please read this!I would appreciate this a lot”.He puts the book on the table near her.It makes her feel like he sees her.“And for that, he tells her some stories.The people he has seen” talk at the museum.”He told a crazy story, he talked about a man that is fighting terrorism when he was young,” a great guy that could make money.”
I am so grateful for that.”Please continue the following text in style of the source text He sees time on his watch while leaning to put the book.“Oh sorry!It’s 8!Shit!I have completely forgotten!I have a meeting with supreme command representatives, need to run!I’m so sorry!” he composes himself, checks his backpack, everything.“So write the thing, right?When you are done - it’ll be good.Remember, that I’m here to support you.Ok!Bye!” he quickly ties the backpack, puts it on his back, runs away.She hears a key turn.She takes the remaining noodles to the bathroom and flushes them down the toilet.She has 2 more packs left.The next day.The air in the room is stuffy and she opens windows some around noon to let in the fresh air.She leans to the window grill, breathing the cold air.“Hallo” she hears the voice, looks at the house opposite, sees the same woman calling her.She sees the woman and waves her with her hand and cires “hey” in reply.The woman speaks to her in german.She looks to be in her mid 40s.She wears glasses.Cards are her favorite.The woman takes a seat behind her, but there is one exception.The window is open to the left.Her arms are resting on the couch between her legs. She can see the house and she asks if she may use the bathroom."Yes, sir."He does. The woman tries to hold it as she says it in Korean.So it is a Japanese translation of a Korean English translation.The female voice in English says if their relationship is not made public, it will become official.She looks around and sees the house and looks at the door.If that is not the case, she thinks the woman should ask to see her hair, it is more that the house is open to them.Caught in the crossfire.The woman's face is cold and her expression is dark.With a hint of anger she screams but she won't follow up with.In the end she sends her back to the door.Cases are usually kept secret.Cannot decide to have the girls leave from their home.‮‡There could be a misunderstanding with the family or maybe it is a misunderstanding with the family of the girl.It is so serious that she does not want to even have the girls around or see anyone else.Citizens can change all the laws and rules.It is not necessary to have proof of this to have a chance of obtaining such an end.In the end, it is all up to the child.When she sees the house and all the girls are there, she says it will be alright.If the girl cannot leave, no one will enter.‒No one will enter!"Please continue the following text in style of the source text “I don’t speak german” she cries to the woman.The woman stops, her hand waves down in a disappointed gesture and closes the window.She does the same but without a hand wave.Later during the day she goes to the kitchen and notices a paper at the front door.She picks it up.She sees the same form as she burned in the ashtray earlier.She crumples the paper, throws it at the door and goes to the kitchen.The paper ball left laying on the floor in the hallway.He knocks before he enters.He never did this before.There is no pause between the knock and his face suspended in the kitchen door frame.She looks at him back, vexed and tired.“I want a cigarette, Mike” she says to him as if she knew him.He does not smile.His eyes can not find rest.He avoids meeting her eyes.He looks away, to the hallway, notices the crumpled paper, goes to it, picks it up, goes back in silence to the kitchen.She looks at him puzzled when he wriggles back her chair, making a way to the second chair.He sits in it, straightens the paper.A little longer until he picks the paper up and moves on with the cigarette.***he wants me to kill him, and when I don (I really want to), he will try to help me.**she asks how the other one could use the time she was using. It appears she has been at a party for a little while.She goes to her room.On the table.He tries to open the door.When he opens it.***she is sitting on the bed, looking at him from the other side of the bed. She does her best to comfort him, knowing how serious he is.Her thoughts are not too sad.“She goes to the bathroom.There is no sound. She does not look anywhere.***she looks up to see the sun not shining in front of her.She does not go far.There is no sound in the water. She does not have any power.***he was just so bored with the old ways for a short amount of time, no worries about it, the things he would always do.***and he doesn't understand it or what it meant.***he only cares for the time he spent on the back of a van.She just wants her.***there is an opportunity in her hands.***she needs to get a job.She does not want it.She asks him to stop in her room.Just when he opens the door she is in a very difficult position.She is trying to open it, and there really is nothing he can do.***she is afraid and nervous.***well she just needs to be a little more open. He tries to hold her.Please continue the following text in style of the source text His hands as if shaking.He puts his head on his hand, looks at her sternly.She sees he picks his words again.As he does this he gets angry.“Why can’t you simply write this stupid letter and maybe will be done?A?I’ve told you everything that you need to know.But you, all of you keep betraying me.They trust me, they know that I’m not pure, but still they trust.But you!You!” he is really angry now, she moves away as he spits.She stands up and goes to the living room, closing the door after her.She sits in the chair, vexed, and hears a knock on the living room door.He enters the living room, sits on the couch, and looks at her sideways.“Look, I’m sorry for being so emotional.It was a hard day for me.Let’s start this other.Ok?” He says, his voice has apologetic notes, leaning on the couch arm.“Get away from me, please” she says, tired of everything and him.When she says that, he moves back on the couch.He turns around, a look of concern in his eyes. He turns quickly to his hands, and rubs his chin.‹No‹ he says, rubbing her shoulder gently.Is everything ok though?I don't know,“he says, and he lifts his head slightly and stares at her blankly.Please continue the following text in style of the source text He does not lean anymore, his hands clasped and in front of him.He listens to what she says.“That’s not an option now, I’m sorry.I really need your cooperation.Please” he says.“Cooperation on what?” she whets.“I know fucking nothing, I have no internet, I can’t go anywhere!Why?Who the fuck are you to make me do so?Just fucking let me go.” 
She stands up.He stands up almost at the same instant and puts his hand on her shoulder, when she’s standing up, pushing her back on the chair.She pushes his hand off.“Get the fucking AWAY” she runs to the door.She tries to open it.It is locked still.She cries and sits by the door.He comes after her, squats near her.“Hey, it is hard, I know, I’ve been through this myself, I know, I know.But you need to be strong.Nothing is yet decided.We can make this work, ok?”
“You need to answer me. I can’t wait.She looks at him, the blue sky above him shimmering with the rays of rain.I am here waiting.” He holds out and he goes after her and I leave the door open.Please continue the following text in style of the source text I’m here to help and to support!Don’t you understand?” He tries to reason with her.She blankly stares at him and does not say a word.He tries to touch her, she pushes his hand back, but does not move.“Are you gonna talk to me or now?” he says after a long pause and a deep breath.She is silent.“Ok.Ok. Fuck this shit.I’m honestly trying to help you get out of this shit you’re in.And I don’t see any appretitation for this!” he says and goes to the kitchen.He makes himself tea.When he starts to sip his tea, she stands up and goes to her bedroom and lays in the bed, pulling a blanket over her head.When sipping stops he comes to the bedroom, sees her under the blanket.“Are ok now?Ready to talk?” he says to the blanket.She does not reply.He sucks air in his lungs, lets it out.It takes some time.He speaks:
“So let me make this clear.You’re under arrest by the warrant of MEAT.‪And it wasn�t an I and it�s not just a personal grievance here. It�s about who you are, not who I am, who I am being treated as, it�s in your genes, it is against your will.I don�t believe you are ever able to live up to your own values, to be honest.You are like nothing more than a child of the state. You are treated like shit.Like you have the whole damn world of your family as your own property.Your family just lives like fuckers.They put on airs you know this, and you are treated like a whore. You are taken from a parent.Your family is like shit.You cry like shit every day and the only thing I hope you never can do is sleep.It´s so fucking cruel.I thought you deserved it.When he finishes the sentence he lets out an even louder "Oh, you are all so cool.", she looks up at him and smiles at him and says:‣Yeah, it made me happy too. I can wait for you to sleep.That means you want to live a normal life.To think I would treat you the way I did, would bring us closer together and create a better life together.I can't wait for you to fall in love with me.But I can take as much pleasure you have already given me from your good times.To share your dreams and my dreams.Not once does a person seem a bit too happy or comfortable or nice about himself.He is so completely in love with me.I'm so filled with love. I love you as muchPlease continue the following text in style of the source text You are under the investigation.You’ve sinned - you’ve trashed around, you’ve worked for Amazon.You did nothing good.You basically ate and shite and that was all.Mother Earth hates you, you did her harm.But I believe that you're a good person, who is just lost.And you’re rejecting my helping hand!Do you understand that?Please take it!Take it!And please write!I’ve asked you to fill the self-critic form.Without repentance it could be no redemption, I hope you understand.Do write it!”
She hears his steps and a sound of the closing door.When she pulls the blanket down, she sees a new form.It looks exactly like the old one, except for a few things: it is not crumpled and in the right top corner she sees the red line.
