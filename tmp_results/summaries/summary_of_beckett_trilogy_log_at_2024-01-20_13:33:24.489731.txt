And she came back a little later, holding with the tips 
of her fingers the hat in question, retrieved perhaps from the 
rubbish-heap at the end of the vegetable-garden, for to know 
everything takes too long, for it was fringed with manure and 
seemed to be rotting away.And what is more she suffered him to 
put it on, and even helped him to do so, helping him to sit up in 
the bed and arranging his pillows in such a way that he might 
remain propped up without fatigue.And she contemplated with 
tenderness the old bewildered face relaxing, and in its tod of 
hair the mouth trying to smile, and the little red eyes turning 
timidly towards her as if in gratitude or rolling towards the re- 
covered hat, and the hands raised to set it on more firmly and 
returning to rest trembling on the blanket.And at last a long 
look passed between them and Moll’s lips puffed and parted in a 
dreadful smile, which made Macmann’s eyes waver like those of 
an animal glared on by its master and compelled then finally to 
look away.End of anecdote.This must be the selfsame hat that 
was abandonend in the middle of the plain, its resemblance to it 
is so great, allowance being made for the additional wear and 
tear.Can it be then that it is not the same Macmann at all, after 
all, in spite of the great resemblance (for those who know the 
power of the passing years), both physical and otherwise.

It is 
true the Macmanns are legion in the island and pride them- 
selves, what is more, with few exceptions, on having one and all, 
in the last analysis, sprung from the same illustrious ball.It is 
therefore inevitable they should resemble one another, now and 
then, to the point of being confused even in the minds of those 
who wish them well and would like nothing better than to tell 
between them.No matter, any old remains of flesh and spirit do, 
there is no sense in stalking people.So long as it is what is called 
a living being you can’t go wrong, you have the guilty one.For 
a long time he did not stir from his bed, not knowing if he could 
walk, or even stand, and fearing to rifii foul of the authorities, 
if he could.Let us then first consider this first phase of Macmann’s 
stay in the House of Saint John of God.We shall then pass on to 
the second, and even to the third, if necessary.A thousand little things to report, very strange, in view of myMALONE DIES

curious tendency, as I realize at last, to annihilate all they purport

to jnention only it, which has seized on certain parts of my 
economy, I will not specify which.And to think I was expecting 
rather to grow cold, if anything!This first phase, that of the bed, was characterized by the

There sprang up gradually between them a kind of intimacy 
which, at a given moment, led them to lie together and copulate 
as best they could.For given their age and scant experience of 
carnal love, it was only natural they should not succeed, at the 
first shot, in giving each other the impression they wore made for 
each other.The spectacle was then offered of Macmann trying to 
bundle his sex into his partner’s like a pillow into a pillow-slip, 
folding it in two and stuffing it in with his fingers.But far from 
losing heart they warmed to their work.And though both were 
completely impotent they finally succeeded, summoning to their 
aid all the resources of the skin, the mucus and the imagination, 
in striking from their dry and feeble clips a kind of sombre 
gratification.So that Moll exclaimed, being (at that stage) the more 
expansive of the two.Oh would we had but met sixty years agQ!But on the long road to this what flutterings, alarms and bashful 
fumblings, of which only this, that they gave Macmann some 
insight into the meaning of the expression, Two is company.He 
then made unquestionable progress in the use of the spoken word 
and learnt in a short time to let fall, at the right time, the yesses, 
noes, mores and enoughs that keep love alive.It was also the 
occasion of his penetrating into the enchanted world of reading, 
thanks to the inflammatory letters which Moll brought and put 
into his hands.

And the memories of school are so tenacious, for 
those who have been there, that he was soon able to dispense with 
the explanations of his correspondent and understand all unaided, 
holding the sheet of paper as far from his eyes as his arms per- 
mitted.While he read Moll held a little aloof, with downcast 
eyes, saying to herself.Now he’s at the part where, and a little 
later.Now he’s at the part where, and so remained until the262

he had finished.Then she turned eagerly towards him, in time to 
see him raise the letter to his lips or press it against his heart, 
another reminiscence of the fourth form.Then he gave it back 
to her «and she put it under his pillow with the others there 
already, arranged in chronological order and tied together with a 
favour.These letters did not much vary in form and tenor, which 
greatly facilitated matters for Macmann.Example.Sweetheart, 
Not one day goes by that I do not give thanks to God, on my 
bended knees, for having found you, before I die.For we shall 
soon die, you and I, that is obvious.That it may be at the same 
moment exactly is all I ask.In any case I have the key of the 
medicine cupboard.But let us profit first by this superb sundown,

all is relative, let us bear that in mind, stags and hinds have their 
needs and we have ours.It is even astonishing that you manage so 
well, I can hardly get over it, what a chaste and sober life you 
must have led.I too, you must have noticed it.Consider moreover 
that the flesh is not the end-all and the be-all, especially at our 
age, and name me the lovers who can do with their eyes what we 
can do with ours, which will soon have seen all there is for them 
to see and have often great difficulty in remaining open, and with 
their tenderness, without the help of passion, what by this means 
alone we realize daily, when separated' by our respective obli- 
gations.Consider furthermore, since there is nothing more for us 
to hide, that I was never beautiful or well-proportioned, but ugly

I have not forgotten the expression.

And you, sweet, even when 
you were of an age to quicken the pulse of beauty, did you 
exhibit the other requisites?I doubt it.But with the passing of 
the years we have become scarcely less hideous than even our best 
favoured contemporaries and you, in particular, have kdpt your

our methods, leave all that to me, and I warrant you we’ll

my instructions, you’ll come back for more.For shame, you dirty 
old man!It’s all these bones that makes it awkward, that I grant 
you.Well, we must just accept ourselves as we a.e.And above all 
not fret, these are trifles.Let us think of the hours when, spent, 
we lie twined together in the dark, our hearts laboring as one, 
and listen to the wind saying what it is to be abroad, at night, in 
winter, and what it is to have been what we have been, and sink

Such was the 
rather rambling style of the declarations which Moll, despairing 
no doubt of giving vent to her feelings by the normal channels, 
addressed three or four times a week to Macmann, who never 
answered, I mean in writing, but manifested by every other 
means in his power how pleased he was to receive them.But 
towards the close of this idyll, that is to say when it was 
too late, he began to compose brief rimes of curious structure, to 
offer to his mistress, for he felt she was drifting away from him.Examp’s.

Of the nearest cemetery 
With his Sucky hand in hand 
Love it is at last leads Hairy.He had time to compose ten or twelve more or less in this vein, 
all remarkable for their exaltation of love regarded as a kind of 
lethal glue, a conception frequently to be met with in mystic 
texts.And it is extraordinary that Macmann should have suc- 
ceeded, in .so short a time and after such inauspicious beginnings, 
in elevating himself to a view of this altitude.And one can only 
speculate on what he might have achieved if he had become 
acquainted with true sexuality at a less advanced age.I am lost.Not a word.Inauspicious beginnings indeed, during which his feeling for 
Moll was frankly one of repugnance.

Her lips in particular 
repelled him, those selfsame lips, or so little changed as to make 
no matter, that some months later he was to suck with grunts of 
pleasure, so that at the very sight of them he not only closed 
his eyes, but covered them with his hands for greater safety.She 
it was therefore who at this period exerted herself in tireless 
ardours, which may serve to explain why she seemed to weaken 
in the end and stand in her turn in need of stimulation.Unless 
it was simply a question of health.Which does not exclude a 
third hypothesis, namely that Moll, having finally decided that 
she had mistaken in Macmann and that he was not the man she 
had taken him for, sought a means of putting an end to their 
intercourse, but gently, in order not to give him a shock.Un- 
fortunately our concern here is not with Moll, who after all is 
only a female, but with Macmann, and not with the close of their 
relations, but rather with the beginning.Of the brief period of 
plentitude between these two extremes, t when between the warm- 
ing up of the one party and the cooling down of the other there 
was established a fleeting equality of temperature, no further 
mention will be made.For if it is indispensable to have in order 
not to have had and in order to have no longer, there is no

One 
day, just as Macmann was getting used to being loved, though 
without as yet responding as he was subsequently to do, he thrust 
Moll’s face away from his on the pretext of examining her ear- 
rings.But as she made to return to the charge he checked her 
again with the first words that came into his head, namely.Why 
two Christs?, implying that in his opinion one was more than 
sufficient.To which she made the absurd reply.Why two ears?But she Obtained his forgiveness a moment later, saying, with a 
smile (she smiled at the least thing), Besides they are the thieves, 
Christ is in my mouth.Then parting her jaws and pulling down 
her blobber-lip she discovered, breaking with its solitary fang the 
monotomy of the gums, a long yellow canine bared to the roots 
and carved, with the drill probably, to represent the celebrated 
sacrifice.With the forefinger of her free hand shj fingered it.It’s 
loose, she said, one of these fine mornings I’ll wake up and find 
I’ve swallowed it, perhaps I should have it out.She let go her lip, 
which sprang back into place with a smack.This incident made a 
strong impression on Macmann and Moll rose with a bound in 
his affections.And in the pleasure he was later to enjoy, when he 
put his tongue in her mouth and let it wander over her gums, this 
rotten crucifix had assuredly its part.But from these harmless 
aids what love is free?Sometimes it is an object, a garter I believe 
or a sweat-absorber for the armpit.And sometimes it is the simple 
image of a third party.

A few words in conclusion on the decline 
of this liaison.No, I can’t.Weary with my weariness, white last moon, sole regret, not 
even.To be dead, before her, on her, with her, and turn, dead 
on dead, about poor mankind, and never have to die any more, 
from among the living.Not even, not even that.My moon was 
here below, far below, the little I was able to desire.And one 
day, so/n, soon, one earthlit night, beneath the earth, a dying 
being will say, like me, in the earthlight, Not even, not even that, 
and die, without having been able to find a regret.Moll.I’m going to kill her.She continued to look after Mac-

wish to return to her chair and resume the now familiar gesture 
of mastaging her stomach, slowly, weighing on it with her two 
hands.She was also beginning to smell.She had never smelt 
sweet, but between not smelling sweet and giving off the smell she 
was giving off now there is a gulf.She was also subject to fits

And these 
dejections remained sometimes for hours where they fell, until 
such time as she had the strength to go and fetch what was 
needed to clean up the mess.Half a century younger she might 
have been taken for pregnant.At the same time her hair began 
to fall out in abundance and she confessed to Macmann that she 
did not dare comb it any more, for fear of making it fall out even 
faster.He said to himself with satisfaction.She tells me every- 
thing.But these were small things compared to the change in 
her complexion, now rapidly turning from yellow to saffron.The 
sight of her so diminished did not damp Macmann’s desire to 
take her, all stinking, yellow, bald and vomiting, in his arms.And 
he would certainly have done so had she not been opposed to it.One can understand him (her too).For when one has within reach 
the one and only love requited of a life so monstrously prolonged, 
it is natural one should wish to profit by it, before it is too late, 
and refuse to be deterred by feelings of squeamishness excusable 
in the faint-hearted, but which true love disdains.And though all 
pointed to Moll’s being out of sorts, Macmann could not help 
interpreting her attitude as a falling off of her affection for him.And perhaps indeed then; was something of that too.At all 
events the more she declined the more Macmann longed to crush 
her to his breast, which is at least sufficiently curious and un- 
usual to deserve of mention.

And when 1 she turned and looked at 
him (and from time to time she did so still), with eyes in which 
he fancied he could read boundless regret and love, then a kind 
of frenzy seized upon him and he began to belabor with his fists 
his chest, his head and even the mattress, writhing and crying out.MALONE DIES

writhed and beat his breast, for she made no attempt to stop 
him and even left the room if it went on too long for he* liking.Then, all alone and unobserved, he continued to behave as if 
beside himself, which is proof positive, is it not, that he was 
disinterested, unless of course he suspected her of having stopped 
outside the door to listen.And when he grew calm again at last 
he mourned the long immunity he had lost, from shelter, charity 
and human tenderness.And he even carried his inconsequence 
to the length of wondering what right anyone had to take care 
of him.In a word most evil days, for Macmann.For Moll too

tooth.It fell unaided from the socket, happily i» the daytime, so

for as long as ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, motionless or

the great hall where the staff assembled at dawn before entering 
on their duties, there would be seen pinned on the board a note 
thus conceived.Let one hundred and sixty-six get up and go out.For when it came to the regulations Moll was inflexible and their

alive by memory, his mind crawling with cobras, not daring to 
dream or think and powerless not to, his cries were of two kinds, 
those having no other cause than moral anguish and those, similar 
in every respect, by means of which he hoped to forestall same.Physical pain, on the contrary, seemed to help him greafly.And 
one day rolling up the leg of his trousers, he showed Macmann 
his shin covered with bruises, scars and abrasions.Then produc-

right in the middle of his ancient wounds, so violent a blow that 
he fell down backwards, or perhaps I should say forwards.

medium height and build, block-hat pressed delicately to stomach 
with finger-tips, then without warning in a gesture of extraordinary 
suddenness and precision slapped on skull.A folding-rule, to-

having called prematurely.He remained some time, seven hours 
at least.Perhaps he hoped to have the satisfaction of seeing me 
expire before he left, that would probably havccsa\ed him time

off.What a hope, it would have been a crime.He must have left 
at six o’clock, his working day ended.The light is queer ever 
since.That it to say he went a first time, came back some hours 
later, then left for good.He must have been here from nine to 
twelve, then from two to six, now I have it.He kept looking at 
his watch, a turnip.Perhaps he will come back to-morrow.It was 
in the morning he hit me, about ten o’clock probably.

In the

yourself in their place, it is not difficult.The only thing you must 
never speak of is your happiness, I can think of nothing else for 
the moment.Better even not to think of it.Standing by the bed 
he watched me.Seeing my lips move, for I tried to speak, he 
stooped down to me.I had things to ask him, to give me my 
stick for example.He would have refused.Then with clasped 
hands and tears in my eyes I would have begged it of him as a

the keepers, in their white clothes, armed with sticks and lanterns, 
spread out from the buildings and beat the thickets, the copses

him with the direst reprisals if he did not surrender immediately.But they finally remarked that he hid, when he did, always in 
the same place and that such a deployment of force was un-

other night sounds that you cannot tell the meaning of.And it 
sometimes happened that Macmann, weary of not being alone 
went away alone and back into his cell and remained there until 
Lemuel rejoined him, much later, it was a genuine English park, 
though far from England, extravagantly unformal, luxuriant to 
the point of wildness, the trees at war with one another, and the 
bushes, and the wild flowers and weeds, all ravening for earth and 
light.One evening Macmann went back to his cell w’th a branch 
torn from a dead bramble, for use as a stick to support him as 
he walked.Then Lemuel took it from him and struck him with it 
over and over again, no, that won’t work, then Lemuel called a 
keeper by the name of Pat, a thorough brute though puny in 
appearance, and said to him, Pat will you look at that.Then 
Pat snatched the stick from Macmann who, seeing the turn things 
were taking, was holding it clutched tight in his.two hands, and 
struck him with it until Lemuel told him to stop, JHid even for 
some little time afterwards.All this without a word of explanation.

So that a little later Macmann, having brought back from his 
walk a hyacinth he had torn up bulb and roots in the*hope of 
being able to keep it a little longer thus than if he had simply 
plucked it, was fiercely reprimanded by Lemuel who wrenched 
the pretty flower from his hands and threatened to hand him over 
to Jack again, no, to Pat again.Jack is a different one.And yet 
the fact of having half demolished the bush, a kind of laurel, in 
order to hide in it, had never brought upon his head the least 
reproof.This is not necessarily surprising, there was no proof 
against him.Had he been questioned about it he would naturally 
have told the truth for he did not suspect he had done anything 
wrong.But they must have assumed he would do nothing but 
lie and stoutly deny and that it was therefore useless to press him 
with questions.Besides no questions were ever asked in the House 
of Sain John of God, but stern measures were simply taken, or 
not token, according to tTie dictates of a peculiar logic.For, when 
you come to think of it, in virtue of what possible principle of 
justice can a flower in the hand fasten on the bearer the crime of 
having gathered it?Or was the mere fact of holding it for all to 
see in itself a felony, analogous to that of the receiver or fence?278

And if so would it not have been preferable to make this known, 
quite plainly and frankly, to all concerned, so that the sense of 
guilt, instead of merely following on the guilty act, might precede

very nicely indeed.Summarization models summary:

the crows and starlings, for distant pastures, came back the

awaited them.The gulls were many in stormy weather which

lost it, and would have enough of again, when he got it back 
again, and without suspecting that the thing so often felt to be 
excessive, and honoured by such a variety of names, was perhaps 
in reaftty always one and the same.But there was one reflecting 
in his place and setting down coldly the sign of equality where it 
was needed, as if that could make any difference.So he had only 
to go on gasping, in his artless way.Enough!Enough!, as he 
crept along by the wall under the cover of the bushes, searching 
for a breach through which he might slip out, under cover of 
night, or a place with footholds where he might climb over.But 
the wall was unbroken and smooth and topped uniterruptedly 
with broken glass, of a bottle green.But let us cast a glance at 
the main entrance, wide enough to admit two large vehicles 
abreast and flrnked by two charming lodges covered with 
Virginia creeper and occupied by large deserving families, to 
judge by the swarms of little brats playing nearby, pursuing one 
another with cries of joy, rage and grief.But space hemmed him 
in on every side and held him in its toils, with the multitude of 
other faintly stirring, faintly struggling things, such as the child- 
ren, the lodges and the gates, and like a sweat of things the 
moments streamed away in a great chaotic conflux of oozings and

like swimmers.They seldom came near to one another, because 
they were few and the park was vast.

But when chance brought

seemed to be made of straw.Diligently Moll pressed her lips 
together, in order to hide her great buck-teeth.The roses must

bowl the soup of the previous day had congealed.The reverse

used that he had long since ceased to wonder on what this crea-

his full bucket filled it with fresh soup.Then he went, a bucket in 
each hand, whereas up to now a single hand had been enough to 
carry the two buckets.Because of the excursion he locked the 
door behind him, an unnecessary precaution.

swathed himself in his two blankets as in swaddlings and over 
and above this rough and ready cocoon he wore his cloak.He 
gathered it shiveringly about him, with one hand, for he needed 
the other to help him in his investigation of all that aroused his 
suspicions.Good-morning, good -morning, good-morning, he said, 
with a strong foreign accent and darting fearful glances all about 
him, fucking awful business this, no, yes?Sudden starts instantly

soup, examined drop by drop, had been transferred in its entirety

filling and emptying.Dreamt all night of that bloody man Quin

whictt I cannot speak, but also, which is even more interesting, but 
also that I, which is if possible even more interesting, that I shall

been here.But I dare not infer from this that nothing ever will 
change.Let us try and see where these considerations lead.I have 
been here, ever since I began to be, my appearances elsewhere 
having been put in by other parties.All has proceeded, all this

two manifestations the meaning of which escapes me.No, it is not 
that their meaning escapes me, my own escapes me just as much.Here all things, no, I shall not say it, being unable to.I owe my 
existence to no one, these faint fires are not of those that illuminate 
or bum.Going nowhere, coming from nowhere, Malone passes.These notions of forbears, of houses where lamp^ are lit at night,

in the same direction, the same attitude.But the play of the lights 
is truly unpredictable.It is only fair to say that to eyes less knowing

do they not sometimes do so?They are perhaps unwavering and 
fixed and my fitful perceiving the cause of their inconstancy.I 
hope I may have occasion to revert to this question.But I shall 
remark without further delay, in order to be sure of doing so, 
that I am relying on those lights, as indeed on all other similar 
sources of credible perplexity, to help me continue and perhaps 
even conclude.I resume, having no alternative.Where was I?Ah 
yes, from the unexceptionable order which has prevailed here up 
to date may I infer that such will always be the case?I may of

a need to know as one might say?I don’t know.I’ll try it another 
way.If one day a change were to take place, resulting from a prin- 
ciple of disorder already present, or on its way, what then?That 
would seem to depend on the nature of the change.No, here all 
change would be fatal and land me back, there and then, in all the 
fun of the fair.I’ll try it another way.Has nothing really changed 
since I have been here?No, frankly, hand on heart, wait a second, 
no, nothing, to my knowledge.But, as I have said, the place may 
well be vast, as it may well measure twelve feet in diameter.It 
comes to the same thing, as far as discerning its limits is concerned.I like to think ^occupy the centre, but nothing is less certain.In a 
sense I would be better off at the circumference, since my eyes are 
always fixed in the same direction.But I am certainly not at the 
circumference.For if I were it would follow that Molloy...wheeling 
about me as he does, would issue from the enceinte at every revo- 
lution, which is manifestly impossible.But does he in fact wheel, 
does he not perhaps simply pass before me in a straight line?No, he wheels, I feel it, and about me, like a planet about its sun.And if he made a noise, as he goes, I would hear him all the time, 
on my right hand, behind my back, on my left hand, before seeing 
him again.

But he makes none, for I am not deaf, of that I am 
convinced, that is to say half-convinced.From centre to circum- 
ference in any case it is a far cry and I may well be situated some- 
where between the two.It is equally possible, I do not deny it, that 
I too am in perpetual motion, accompanied by Malone, as the 
earth by its moon.In which case there would be no further grounds 
for my complaining about the disorder of the lights, this being due 
simply to my insistence on regarding them as always the same 
lights and viewed always from the same point.All is possible, 
or almost.But the best is to think of myself as fixed and at the 
centre o' this place, whatever its shape and extent may be.This 
is also probably the most pleasing to me.In a word, no change 
apparently since I have been here, disorder of the lights perhaps 
an illusion, all change to be feared, incomprehensible uneasiness.That I am not stone deaf is shown by the sounds that reach 
me.For though the silence here is almost unbroken, it is not com-298

immaculate silence a feeble cry was heard, by me.I do not know 
if Malone heard it too.I was surprised, the word is not too strong.After so long a silence a little cry, stifled outright.What kind of 
creature uttered it and, if it is the same, still does, from time to 
time?Impossible to say.Not a human one in any case, there are 
no human creatures here, or if there are they have done with 
crying.Is Malone the culprit?Am I?Is it not perhaps a simple

happens, to inquire what.If only I were not obliged to manifest.And why speak of a cry?Perhaps it is something breaking, some 
two things colliding.There are sounds here, from time to time,

for this place to be ready to receive me?Or did it wait for me to 
come and people it?

By far the better of these hypotheses, from 
the point of view of usefulness, is the former, and I shall often 
have occasion to fall back on it.But both are distasteful.I shall 
say therefore that our beginnings coincide, that this place was 
made for me, and I for it, at the same instant.And the sounds

Can

subjects, of conversation.They also gave me the low-down on God.They told me I depended on him, in the last analysis.They had it 
on the reliable authority of his agents at Bally I forget what, this 
being the place, according to them, where the inestimable gift of 
life had been rammed down my gullet.But what they were most 
determined for me to swallow was my fellow-creatures.In this they 
were without mercy.I remember little or nothing pf these lectures.I cannot have understood a great deal.But I seem to have retained 
certain descriptions, in spite of myself.They gave me courses on 
love, on intelligence, most precious, most precious.They also taught 
me to count, and even to reason.Some of this rubbish has come 
in handy on occasions, I don’t deny it, on occasions which would 
never have arisen if they had left me in peace.I use it still, to 
scratch my arse with.Low types they must have been, their pockets 
full of poison and antidote.Perhaps all this instruction was by 
correspondence.And yet I seem to know their faces.From photo- 
graphs perhaps.When did all this nonsense stop?And has it 
stopped?A few last questions.Is it merely a lull?There were 
four or five of them at me, they called that presenting their report.One in particular, Basil I think he was called, filled me with hatred.Summarization models summary:

his eyes and T feel the long imploring gaze, as if I could do some- 
thing for him.Another impression, no doubt equally false, he 
brings me presents and dare not give them.He takes them away 
again, or he lets them fall, and they vanish.He does n<yt come 
often, I cannot be more precise, but regularly assuredly.His visit 
has never coincided, up to now, with the transit of Malone.But 
perhaps some day it will.That would not necessarily be a violation 
of the order prevailing here.For if I can work out to within a few 
inches the orbit of Malone, assuming perhaps erroneously that he 
passes before me at a distance of say three feet, with*regard to the 
other’s career I must remain in the dark.

For I am incapable not 
only of measuring time, which in itself is sufficient to vitiate all 
calculation in this connection, but also of comparing their res- 
pective velocities.So I cannot tell if I shall ever have the good 
fortune to see the two of them at once.But I am inclined, to think 
I shall.For if I were never to see the two of them at once, then 
it would follow, or should follow, that between their respective 
appearances the interval never varies.No, wrong.For the interval 
may vary considerably, and indeed it seems to me it does, without 
ever being abolished.Nevertheless I am inclined to think, because 
of this erratic interval, that my two visitors may some day meet 
before my eyes, collide and perhaps even knock each other down.I have said that all things here recur sooner or later, no, I was 
going to say it, then thought better of it.But is it not possible that 
this does not apply to encounters?The only encounter I ever wit- 
nessed, a long time ago now, has never yet been re-enacted.It was 
perhaps the end of something.And I shall perhaps be delivered 
of Malone and the other, not that they disturb me, the day I see 
the two of them at one and the same time, that is to say in collision.Unfortunately they are not the only disturbers of my peace.Others 
come towards me, pass before me, wheel about me.And no doubt 
others st.11, invisible so far.I repeat they do not disturb me.But

But the days of sticks are over, here I can count 
on my body alone, my body incapable of the smallest movement 
and whose very eyes can no longer close as they once could, ac- 
cording to Basil and his crew, to rest me from seeing, to rest me 
from waking, to darken me to sleep, and no longer look away, or 
down, or up open to heaven, but must remain forever fixed and 
staring on the narrow space before them where there is nothing to 
be seen, 99 per cent of the time.They must be as red as live coals.I sometimes wonder if the two retinae are not facing each other.And come to think of it this grey is shot with rose, likg the plumage 
of certain birds, among which I seem to remember the cockatoo.Whether all grow black, or all grow bright, or all remain grey, 
it is grey we ndfed, to begin with, because of what it is, and of what 
it can do, made of bright and black, able to shed the former, or the 
latter, and be the latter or the former alone.But perhaps I am the 
prey, on the subject of grey, in the grey, to delusions.How, in such conditions, can I write, to consider only the 
manual aspect of that bitter folly?I don’t know.I could know.But I shall not know.Not this time.It is I who write, who cannot 
raise my hand from my knee.It is I who think, just enough to 
write, whose head is far.I am Matthew and I am the angel, I who 
came before the cross, before the sinning, came into the world, came 
here.I add this, to be on the safe side.

These things I say, and 
shall say, if I can, are no longer, or are not yet, or never were, or 
never will be, or if they were, if they are, if they will be, were not 
here, are not here, will not be here, but elsewhere.But I am here.So I am obliged to add this.I who am here, who cannot speak, 
cannot think, and who must speak, and therefore perhaps think a 
little, cannot in relation only to me who am here, to here where 
I am, but can a little, sufficiently, I don’t know how, unimportant, 
in relatiqn to me who was elsewhere, who shall be elsewhere, and 
to those places where I Was, where I shall be.But I have never 
been elsewhere, however uncertain the future.And the simplest 
therefore is to say that what I say, what I shall say, if I can, relates 
to the place where I am, to me who am there, in spite of my 
inability to think of these, or to speak of them, because of the304

compulsion I am under to speak of them, and therefore perhaps 
think of them a little.Another thing.What I say, what I may say, 
on this subject, the subject of me and my abode, has already been 
said since, having always been here, I am here still.At last a piece 
of reasoning that pleases me, and worthy of my situation.So I 
have no cause for anxiety.And yet I am anxious.So I am not 
heading for disaster, I am not heading anywhere, my adventures 
are over, my say said, I call that my adventures.And yet I feel 
not.Summarization models summary:

And indeed I greatly fear, since my speech can only be of 
me and here that I am once more engaged in putting an end to 
both.Which would not matter, far from it, but for the obligation, 
once rid of them, to begin again, to start again from nowhere, 
from no one and from nothing and win to me agiiin, to me here 
again, by fresh ways to be sure, or by the ancient ways, unrecog- 
nisable at each fresh faring.Whence a certain confusion in the 
exordia' tong enough to situate the condemned and prepare him 
for execution.And yet I do not despair of one day sparing me, 
without going silent.And that day, I don’t know why, I shall be 
able to go silent, and make an end, I know it.Yes, the hope is 
there, once again, of not making me, not losing me, of staying 
here, where I said I have always been, but I had to say something 
quick, of ending here, it would be wonderful.But is it to be wished?Yes, it is to be wished, to end would be wonderful, no matter 
who I am, no matter where I am.I hope this preamble will soon come to an end and the state- 
ment begin that will dispose of me.Unfortunately I am afraid, as 
always, of going on.

For to go on means going from here, means 
finding me, losing me, vanishing and beginning again, a stranger 
first, then little by little the same as always, in another place, where 
I shall say I have always been, of which I shall know nothing, 
being incapable of seeing, moving, thinking, speaking, but of which 
little by little, in spite of these handicaps, I shall begin to know 
something, just enough for it to turn oitl to be the same place as 
always, the same which seems made for me and does not want 
me, which I seem to want and do not want, take your choice, 
which spews me out or swallows me up.I’ll never know, which is

with my head, my hands, my feet, my back, and ever murmuring 
my old stories, my old story, as if it were the first time.So there 
is nothing to be afraid of.And yet I am afraid, afraid of what my 
words will do to me, to my refuge, yet again.Is there really nothing 
new to try?I mentioned my hope, but it is not serious.If I could 
speak and yet say nothing, really nothing?Then I might escape 
being gnawed to death as by an old satiated rat, and my little

But it seems impossible to 
speak and yet say nothing, you think you have succeeded, but 
you always o^rlook something, a little yes, a little no, enough 
to exterminate a regiment of dragoons.And yet I do not despair, 
this time, while saying who I am, where I am, of not losing me, 
of not going from here, of ending here.What prevents tfk, miracle 
is the spirit of method to which I have perhaps been a little too 
addicted.The fact that Prometheus was delivered twenty-nine thou- 
sand nine hundred and seventy years after having purged his offence 
leaves me naturally as cold as camphor.For between me and that 
miscreant who mocked the gods, invented fire, denatured clay and 
domesticated the horse, in a word obliged humanity, I trust 
there is nothing in common.But the thing is worth mentioning.In a word, shall I be able to speak of me and of this place without 
putting an end to us, shall I ever be able to go silent, is there any 
connection between these two questions?Nothing like issues.There 
are a few to be going on with, perhaps one only.All these Murphys, Molloys and Malones do not fool me.They 
have made me waste my time, suffer for nothing, speak of them 
when, in order to stop speaking, I should have spoken of me and 
of me alone.But I just said I have spoicen of me, am speaking of 
me.I don’t care a curse what I just said.It is now I shall speak 
of me i‘or the first time.I thought I was right in enlisting these 
sufferers of my pains.I was wrong.

They never suffered my pains, 
their pains are nothing, compared to mine, a mere tittle of mine, 
the tittle I thought I could put from me, in order to witness it.Let them be gone now, them and all the others, those I have used306

and those I have not used, give me back the pains I lent them and 
vanish, from my life, my memory, my terrors and shames.There, 
now there is no one here but me, no one wheels about me, no one 
comes towards me, no one has ever met anyone before my eyes, 
these creatures have never been, only I and this black void have 
ever been.And the sounds?No, all is silent.And the lights, on 
which I had set such store, must they too go out?Yes, out with 
them, there is no light here.No grey either, black is what I should 
have said.Nothing then but me, of which I know nothing, except 
that I have never uttered, and this black, of which I know nothing 
either, except that it is black, and empty.That then is what, since 
I have to speak, I shall speak of, until I need speak no more.And 
Basil and his gang?Inexistent, invented to explain I forget what.Ah yes, all lies, God and man, nature and the light of day, the 
heart's outpourings and the means of understanding, all invented, 
basely, uy me alone, with the help of no one, since there is no one, 
to put off the hour when I must speak of me.There will be no more

I, of whom 1 know nothing, I know my eyes are open, because 
of the tears that pour from them unceasingly.I know I am seated, 
my hands on my knees, because of the pressure against my rump, 
against the soles of my feet, against the palms of my hands, against 
my knees.Against my palms the pressure is of my knees, against 
my knees of my palms, but what is it that presses against my rump, 
against the soles of my feet?I don’t know.My spine is not sup- 
ported.I mention these details to make sure I am not lying on my 
back, my legs raised and bent, my eyes closed.It is well to establish 
the position of the body from the outset, before passing on to more 
important matters.But what makes me say I gaze straight before 
me, as I have said?I feel my back straight, my neck stiff and free 
of twist and up on top of it the head, like the ball of the cup-and- 
ball in its cup at the end of the stick.These comparisons are un- 
called for.Then there is the way of flowing of my tears which 
flow all over my face, and even down along the neck, in a way it 
seems to me they could not do if the face were bowed, or lifted 
up.But I must not confuse the unbowed head with the level gaze, 
nor the vertical with the horizontal plane.This question in any caseTHE UNNAMABLB

is secondary, since I see nothing.Am I clothed?I have often asked 
myself this question, then suddenly started talking about Malone’s 
hat, or Molloy’s greatcoat, or Murphy’s suit.

If I am, I am but 
lightly.For I feel my tears coursing over my chest, my sides, and 
all down my back.Ah yes, I am truly bathed in teaii.They 
gather in my beard and from there, when it can hold no more — 
no, no beard, no hair either, it is a great smooth ball I carry on 
my shoulders, featureless, but for the eyes, of which only the sockets 
remain.And were it not for the distant testimony of my palms, 
my soles, which I have not yet been able to quash, ^ would gladly 
give myself the shape, if not the consistency, of an egg, with two 
holes no matter where to prevent it from bursting, for the con- 
sistency is more like that of mucilage But softly, softly, other- 
wise I’ll never arrive.In the matter of clothes then 1 can think of 
nothing for the moment but possibly puttees, with perhaps a few 
rags clinging to me here and there.No more obsceniu's either.Why should I have a sex, who have no longer a nose?All those 
things have fallen, all the things that stick out, with my eyes, my 
hair, without leaving a trace, fallen so far, so deep, that I heard 
nothing, perhaps are falling still, my hair slowly like soot still, 
of the fall of my ears heard nothing.Mean words, and needless, 
from the mean old spirit, I invented love, music, the smell of 
flowering currant, to escape from me.Summarization models summary:

But do I roll, in the manner of a true ball?Or am I in equilibrium somewhere, on one of my numberless 
poles?I feel strongly tempted to inquire.What reams of discourse 
I could elici^ from this seemingly so legitimate preoccupation.But which would not be credited to me.No, between me and the 
right to silence, the living rest, stretches the same old lesson, the 
.one I once knew by heart and would not say, I deto’t know why, 
perhaps for fear of silence, or thinking any old thing would do, 
and so for preference lies, in order to remain hidden, no impor-

hills, in the plains, by the shores, on the seas, behind my mannikins, 
I was not always sad, I wasted my time, abjured my rights, suffered 
for nothing, forgot my lesson.Then a little hell after my own heart, 
not too cruel, with a few nice damned to foist my groans on, 
something sighing off and on and the distant gleams of pity’s fires 
biding their hour to promote us to ashes.I speak, speak, because 
I must, but I do not listen, I seek my lesson, my life I used to 
know and would not confess, hence possibly an occasional slight 
lack of limpidity.And perhaps now again I shall do no more than 
seek my lesson, to the self-accompaniment of a tongue that is not

is doomed to crumble, but it takes too long, it’s getting late, eyes

what it seemed to me I heard then, concerning what I should do,

to say, it seemed to me I only barely heard it, because of the

continuing my yelps, never to forget them and, what is more, to 
ensure they should engender others and finally, in an irresistible 
torrent, banish from my vile mouth all other utterance, from my

have done nothing, unless what I am doing now is something, and 
nothing could give me greater satisfaction.For if I could hear such

writhing or fallen in short-lived swoons, with how much more 
reason should I not hear it now, when supposedly I am burdened 
with myself alone.But this is thinking again.And I see myself slip-

fine to keep silence, but one has also to consider the kind of silence 
one keeps.I listened.One might as well speak and be done with 
it.What liberty!I strained my ear towards what must have been

sea dying — no, none of that, no beach, no shore, the sea is enough.I’ve had enough of shingle, enough of sand, enough of earth, 
enough of sea too.Decidedly Basil is becoming important.I’ll call 
him Mahood instead, I prefer that.I’m queer.It was he told me 
stories about me, lived in my stead, issued forth from me, came 
back to me, entered back into me, heaped stories on my*head.I 
don’t know how it was done.I always liked not knowing, but 
Mahood said it wasn’t right.He didn’t know either, but it worried 
him.It is his voice which has often, always, mingled with mine, 
and sometimes drowned it completely.Until he left me for good, 
or refused to leave me any more, I don’t know.Yes, I don’t know 
if he’s here now or far away, but I don’t think I am far wrong 
in saying that he has ceased to plague me.

When he was away I 
tried to find myself again, to forget what he had said, about me, 
about my misfortunes, fatuous misfortunes, idiotic pains, in the 
light of my true situation, revolting word.But his voice continued 
to testify for me, as though woven into mine, preventing me from 
saying who I was, what I was, so as to have done with saying, done 
with listening.And still today, as he would say, though he plagues 
me no more his voice is there, in mine, but less, less.And being 
no longer renewed it will disappear one day, I hope, from mine, 
completely.But in order Jfor that to happen I must speak, speak.And at the same time, I do not deceive myself, he may come back 
again, or go away again and then come back again.Then my 
voice, the voice, would say.That’s an idea, now I’ll tell one of

evolve, would come to an end for lack of room.Faced then with 
the material impossibility of going any further I should no doubt 
have had to stop, unless of course I elected to set off again at once 
in the opposite direction, to unscrew myself as it were, after paving 
screwed myself to a standstill, which would have been an experience 
rich in interest and fertile in surprises if I am to believe what I 
once was told, in spite of my protests, namely that there is no road 
so dull, on the way out, but it has quite a different aspect, quite a 
different dullness, on the way back, and vice versa.No good 
wriggling, I’m a mine of useless knowledge.But a difficulty arises 
here.

For if by dint of winding myself up, if I may venture that 
ellipse, it doesn’t often happen to me now, if by dint of winding 
myself up, I don’t seem to have gained much time, if by dint of 
winding myself up I must inevitably find myself stuck in the end,

unfold ad infinitum, with no possibility of ever stopping, 
the space in which I was marooned being globular, or is it the earth, 
no matter, I know what I mean.But where is the difficulty 1 ?There 
was one a moment ago, I could swear to it.Not to mention that 
I could quite easily at any moment, literally any, run foul of a 
wall, a tree or similar obstacle, which of course it would be pro- 
hibited to circumvent, and thereby have an end put to my gyrations 
as effectively as by the kind of cramp just mentioned.But obstacles, 
it appears, can be removed in the fullness of time, but not by me, 
me they would stop dead forever, if I lived among them.But even 
without such aids it seems to me that once beyond the equator you 
would start turning inwards again, out of sheer necessity, I some- 
how have that feeling.At the particular moment I am referring to, 
I mean when I took myself for Mahood, I must have been coming

absent ones are awaiting your return, patiently, and you too must 
be patient.It was swarming with them, grandpa, ‘grandma, little

my setting forth, perhaps even an interest in life, the same as of old.Time hung less heavy on their hands.What about throwing him a 
few scraps?No no, it might upset him.They did not want to check 
the impetus that was sweeping me towards them.You wouldn’t 
know him!True, papa, and yet you can’t mistake him.They who 
in the ordinary way never answered when spoken to, my elders, 
my wife, she who had chosen me, rather than one of her suitors.A few more summers and he’ll be in our midst.Where am I going to

lad, it’s your last

taking, they held him back, pointing out that the moment was ill-

period?What was I thinking of?With what ?Was 1 having diffi- 
culty with my morale?The answer to all that is this, I quote 
Malone, that I was entirely absorbed in the business on hand and 
not at all concerned to know precisely, or even approximately, 
what it consisted in.The only problem for me was how to continue, 
since I could not do otherwise, to the best of my declining powers, 
in the motion which had been imparted to me.This obligation, and 
the quasi-impossibility of fulfilling it, engrossed me in a purely 
mechanical way, excluding notably the free play of the intelligence 
and sensibility, so that my situation rather resembled that of an 
old broken-down cart- or bat-horse unable to receive the least 
information either from its instinct or from its observation as to 
whether it is moving towards the stable or away from it, and 
not greatly caring either way.The question, among others, of how 
such things are possible had long since ceased to preoccupy me.This touching picture of my situation I found by no means un- 
attractive and as I recall it I find myself wondering again if I 
was not in fact the creature revolving in that yard, as Mahood 
assured me.Well supplied with pain-killers I drew upon them 
freely, without however permitting myself the lethal dose that 
would have cut short my functions, whatever they may have been.

Having somehow or other remarked the habitation and even ad- 
mitted to myself that I had perhaps seen it before, I gave it no 
further thought, nor to the near and dear ones that filled it to 
overflowing, in a mounting fever of impatience.Though now close

I could have no doubt, but I had to husband my strength, if I was 
ever to arrive.I had no wish to arrive, but I had to do my utmost, 
in order to arrive.A desirable goal, no, I never had time to dwell 
on that.To go on, I still call that on, to go on and get on has been 
my only care, if not always in a straight line, at least in obedience 
to the figure assigned to me, there was never any room in my life 
for anything else.Still Mahood speaking.Never once have I 
stopped.My halts do not count.Their purpose was to enable me 
to go on.I did not use them to brood on my lot, but to rub myself 
as best I might with Elliman’s Embrocation, for example, or to 
give myself an injection of laudanum, no easy matters for a man 
with only one leg.Often the cry went up.He’s down!But in 
reality I had sutik to the ground of my own free will, in order to 
be rid of my crutches and have both hands available to minister 
to myself in peace and comfort.Summarization models summary:

acy of my navigation.And my family could have moved to other 
quarters during my absence, and settled down a hundred leagues 
away, without my deviating by as much as a hair’s-breadth from 
my course.As for the screams of pain and wafts of decomposition, 
assuming I was capable of noticing them, they would have seemed 
to me quite in the natural order of things, such as I had come to 
know it.If before such manifestations I had been compelled eacl 
time to turn aside, I should not have got very far.Washed on the 
surface only by the rains, my head cracking with unutterable im- 
precations, it was from rrtyself I should have had to turn aside, be- 
fore all else.After all perhaps I was doing so, that would account for 
my vaguely circular motion.Lies, lies, mine was not to know, nor 
to judge, nor to rail, but to go.That the bacillus botulinus should 
have exterminated my entire kith and kin, I shall never weary of 
repeating this, was something I could readily admit, but only on 
condition that my personal behaviour had not to suffer by it.LetTHE UNNAMABLE

us rather consider what really took place, if Mahood was telling 
the truth.And why should he have lied to me, he so anxious to 
obtain my adhesion, to what now that I come to think of it, to his 
conception of me?Why?For fear of paining me perhaps.But I 
am there to be pained, that is what my tempters have never grasped.

What they all wanted, each according to his particular notion of 
what is endurable, was that I should exist and at the same time be 
only moderately, or perhaps I should say finitely pained.They 
have even killed me off, with the friendly remark that having 
reached the end of my endurance I had no choice buttfo disappear.The end of my endurance!It was one second they should have 
schooled me to endure, after that I would have held out for all 
eternity, whistling a merry tune.The hard knocks they invented 
for me!But the bouquet was this story of Mahood’s in which I 
appear as upset at having been delivered so economically of a pack 
of blood relations, not to mention the two cunts into the Bargain, 
the one for ever accursed that ejected me into this world and the 
other, infundibuliform, in which, pumping my likes, I tried ,to take 
my revenge.To tell the truth, let us be honest at least, it is some 
considerable time now since I last knew what I was talking about.It is because my thoughts are elsewhere.I am therefore forgiven.So long as one’s thoughts arc somewhere everything is permitted.On then, without misgiving, as if nothing had happened.And let 
us consider what really took place, if Mahood was telling the truth 
when he represented me as rid at one glorious sweep of parents, 
wife and heirs.I’ve plenty of time to blow it all skyhigh, this 
circus where it is enough to breathe to qualify for asphyxiation.I’ll find a way out of it, it won’t be like the other times.But I 
should not like to defame my defamer.Summarization models summary:

better than the other and no less incompatible with the kind of 
creature I might just conceivably have been if they had known how 
to take me.So let us consider now what really occurred.Finally 
I found myself, without surprise, within the building, circular in 
form us already stated, its ground-floor consisting of a single room 
flush with the arena, and there completed my rounds, stamping 
under foot the unrecognisable remains of my family, here a face, 
there a stomach, as the case might be, and sinking into them with 
the ends of my crutches, both coming and going.To say I did so 
with satisfaction would be stretching the truth.For my feeling was 
rather one of annoyance at having to flounder in such muck just 
at the moment when my closing contortions called for a firm and 
level surface.I like to fancy, even if it is not true?that it was in 
mother’s entrails I spent the last days of my long voyage, and set 
out on the next.

No, I have no preference, Isolde’s breast would 
have done just as well, or papa's private parts, or the heart of one 
of the little bastards.But is it certain?Would I have not been more 
likely, in a sudden access of independence, to devour what remained 
of the fatal corned-beef?How often did 1 fall during these final 
stages, while the storms raged without?But enough of this non- 
sense.I was never anywhere but here, no one ever got me out of 
here.Enough of acting the infant who has been told so often 
how he was found under a cabbage that in the end he remembers 
the exact spot in the garden and the kind of life he led there before 
joining the family circle.There will be no more from me about 
bodies and trajectories, sky and earth, I don’t know what it all is.They have told me, explained to me, described to me, what it all 
is, what it looks like, what it’s all for, one after the other, thou- 
sands of times, in thousands of connections, until I must have begun 
to look as if I understood.Who would ever think, to hear me, that 
I’ve never seen anything," never heard anything but their voices?And man, the lectures they gave me on men, before they even 
began trying to assimilate me to him !WYiat I speak of, what I speak 
with, all comes from them.It’s all the same to me, but it’s no 
good, there’s no end to it.Summarization models summary:

there was any dying with that tomfoolery, that’s what they’ve sworn

find traces of myself by the same occasion.That’s decided then.What is strange is that they haven’t been pestering me for some 
time past, yes, they’ve inflicted the notion of time on me too.What 
conclusion, using their methods, am I to draw from this?Mahood 
is silent, that is to say his voice continues, but is no longer renewed.Do they consider me so plastered with their rubbish that I can 
never extricate myself, never make a gesture but their cast must 
come to life?But within, motionless, I can live, and utter me, for 
no ears but my own.The^ loaded me down with their trappings 
and s:oned me through the carnival.I’ll sham dead now, whom 
they couldn’t bring to life, and my monster’s carapace will rot off 
me.But it’s entirely a matter of voices, no other metaphor is appro-

telling it willingly, to keep them quiet in case they should feel like 
refreshing my memory, on the subject of my behaviour above in

and companions in distress.This will leave me free to consider

for what they call my good, let us first try and throw a little light 
on that.To tell the truth— no, first the story.The island.I’m on 
the island.I’ve never left the island, God help me.I was under 
the impression I spent my life in spirals round the earth.Wrong, 
it’s on the island I wind my endless ways.The island, that’s all 
the earth I know.I don’t know it either, never having had the 
stomach to look at it.When I come to the coast I turn back inland.And my course is not helicoidal, I got that wrong too, but a suc- 
cession of irregular loops, now sharp and short as in the waltz, 
now of a parabolic sweep that embraces entire boglands, now be- 
tween the two, somewhere or other, and invariably unpredictable in 
direction, that is to say determined by the panic of the moment.

But at the period I refer to now this active life is at an end, I do 
not move and never shall again, unless it be under the impulsion 
of a third party.For of the great traveller I had been, on my hands 
and knees in the later stages, then crawling on my belly or rolling 
on the ground, only the trunk remains (in sorry trim), surmounted 
by the head with which we are already familiar, this is the part of 
myself the description of which I have best assimilated and retained.Stuck like, a sheaf of flowers in a deep jSr, its neck flush with my 
mouth, on the side of a quiet street near the shambles, I am at rest 
at last.If I turn, I shall not say my head, but my eyes, free to roll 
as they list, I can see the statue of the apostle of horse’s meat, a 
bust.His pupillcss eyes of stone are fixed upon me.That makes

The fact is 
I trouble no one, except possibly that category of hypersensitive 
persons for#whom the least thing is an occasion for scandal and 
indignation.But even here the risk is negligible, such people avoid- 
ing the neighbourhood for fear of being overcome at the sight of 
the cattle, fat and fresh from their pastures, troopVng towards the 
humane killer.From this point of view the spot is well chosen, from 
my point of view.And even those sufficiently unhinged to be 
affected by the spectacle I offer, I mean upset and temporarily 
diminished in their capacity for work and aptitude for happiness, 
need pnly look at me a second time, those who can bring them- 
selves to do it, to have immediately their minds made easy.For 
my face reflects nothing but the satisfaction of one savouring a 
well-earned rest.It is true my mouth was hidden, most of the 
time, and my eyes closed.Ah yes, sometimes it’s in the past, some- 
times in the present.And alone perhaps the state of my skull, 
covered with pustules and bluebottles, these latter naturally abound- 
ing in such a neighbourhood, preserved me from being an object 
of envy for many, and a source of discontent.I hope this gives a 
fair picture of my situation.Once a week I was taken out of my 
receptacle, so that it might be emptied.This duty fell to the pro- 
prietress of the chop-house across the street and she performed it 
punctually and without complaint, beyond an occasional good- 
natured reflection to the 'effect that I was a nasty old pig, for she 
had a kitchen-garden.

Without perhaps having exactly won her 
heart it was clear I did not leave her indifferent.And before putting 
me back she took advantage of the circumstance that my mouth 
was accessible to stick into it a chunk of lights or a marrow-bone.And when snow fell she covered me with a tarpaulin still water- 
tight in places.It was under its shelter, snug and dry, that I becameTHE UNNAMABLE

acquainted with the boon of tears, while wondering to what I 
was indebted for it, not feeling moved.And this not merely once, 
but every time she covered me, that is to say twice or three times 
a year.Yes, it was fatal, no sooner had the tarpaulin settled over 
me, and the precipitate steps of my benefactress died away, than 
the tears began to flow.Is this, was this to be interpreted as an 
effect of gratitude?But in that case should not I have felt grate- 
ful?Besides I realised darkly that if she took care of me thus, it 
was not solely out of goodness, or else I had not rightly under- 
stood the meaning of goodness, when it was explaiged to me.It 
must not be forgotten that I represented for this woman an undeni- 
able asset.For quite apart from the services I rendered to her 
lettuce, I constituted for her establishment a kind of landmark, not 
to say an advertisement, far more effective than for example a chef 
in cardboard, pot-bellied in profile and full face wafer thin.That 
she was well aware of this is shown by the trouble she had taken 
to festoon my jar with Chinese lanterns, of a very pretty effect in 
the twilight, and a fortiori in the night.Summarization models summary:

And the jar itself, so that the 
passer-by might consult with greater ease the menu attached to it, 
had been raised on a pedestal at her own expense.It is thus I learnt 
that her turnips in gravy are not so good as they used to be, but 
that on the other hand her carrots, equally in gravy, are even 
better than formerly.The gravy has not varied.This is the kind 
of language I can almost understand, these the kind of clear and 
simple notions on which it is possible for me to build, I ask for no 
other spiritual nourishment.A turnip, I know roughly what a turnip 
is like, a carrot too, particularly the Flakkee, or Colmar Red.I 
seem to grasp at certain moments the nuance that divides bad 
from worse.And if I do not always feel the full force of yester- 
day and today, this does not detract very much from the satis-

salad, for example, I never heard anything but praise.Yes, I 
represent for her a tidy liftlc capital and, if I should ever happen 
to die, I am convinced she would be genuinely annoyed.This should 
help me to live.I like to fancy that when the fatal hour of reckon-

SAMUEL BECKETT is a character who has created a jar with a menu attached to it.
The menu, which includes turnips in gravy and carrots in gravy, was prepared by a woman whose food is not as good as it used to be, but is still very good.
Samuel Beckett is able to understand and understand the language of the woman's food, which he considers clear and simple notions on which he can build his own spiritual nourishment.
He believes he represents for her a tidy lift of capital and, if he were to die, he believes she would be genuinely annoyed, which would help him to live.
In the past, Samuel BecketT has tried to make the woman understand that he should be shrouded more often, but to no avail.

Perhaps it stops there, perhaps they stopped it there, saying, who

fact is one of their favourite devices, to stop suddenly at the least 
sign of adhesion from me, leaving me high and dry, with nothing 
for my renewal but the life they have imputed to me.And it is 
only when they see me stranded that they take up again the thread 
of my misfortunes, judging me still insufficiently vitalised to bring 
them to a successful contusion alone.But instead of making the

baby, and reached a ripe age, and even senility, without the least 
assistance from them and thanks solely to the hints they had given 
me.To saddle me with a lifetime is probably not enough for them, 
I have to be given a taste of two or three generations.But it’s 
not certain.Perhaps all they have told me has reference to a single 
existence, the confusion of identities being merely apparent aqd 
due to my inaptitude to assume any.

If I ever succeed in dying 
under my own steam, then they will be in a better position to decide 
if I am worthy to adorn another age, or to try the same one again, 
with the benefit of my experience.I may therefore perhaps legiti- 
mately suppose that the one-armed one-legged wayfarer of a 
moment ago ftnd the wedge-headed trunk in which I am now 
marooned are simply two phases of the same carnal envelope, the 
soul being notoriously immune from deterioration and dismember- 
ment.Having lost one leg, what indeed more likely thar* that I 
should mislay the other?And similarly for the arms.A natural 
transition in sum.But what then of that other old age they be- 
stowed upon me.if I remember right, and that other middle age, 
when neither legs nor arms were lacking, but simply the power 
to profit by them?And of that kind of youth in which they had 
to give me up for dead?If I have a warm place, it is not in their 
hearts.Oh I don’t say they haven’t done all they could to be agree- 
able to me, to get me out of here, on no matter what pretext, in 
no matter what disguise.All I reproach them with is their insistence.For beyond them is that other who will not give me quittance 
until they have abandoned me as inutilisable and restored me to 
myself.Then at last I can set about saying what I was, and where, 
during all this long lost time.But who is he, if my guess is right, 
who is waiting for that, from me?And who these others whose 
designs are so different?Summarization models summary:

above, which at night is that of the moon, will not be reflected 
there either, in those little blue mirrors, I used to look at myself 
in them, to try and brighten them.Wrong again, wrong again, this 
effort and this trouble will not be spared me.For the woman, dis-

filling the bottom of my jar with sawdust which she changes every

less hygienic* And I had got used to the stone.Now I’m getting

idle, it saps one’s energy.And I open and close my eyes, open and

And often at dawn, having left it out all night, I

eyes still moist with fornication is for the jar.And when she does

again.But just before she reaches me I up with it like a jack-in-the- 
box, the old eyes glaring up at her.I mentioned I cannot turn my 
head, and this is true, my neck having stiffened prematurely.But 
this does not mean it is always facing in the same direction.For 
with a kind of tossing and writhing I succeed in imparting to my 
trunk the degree of rotation required, and not merely in one 
direction, but in the other also.My little game, which I should 
have thought inoffensive, has cost me dear, and yet I could have 
sworn I was insolvable.It is true one docs not know one’s riches 
until they are lost and I probably have others still that only await 
the thief to be brought to my notice.And today, if I can still open 
and close my eyes, as in fhe past, I can no longer, because of my 
roguish character, move my head in arjd out, as in the good old

it’s a lot to ask, that he should first behave as if he were not, then 
as if he were, before being admitted to that peace where he neither

the mad wish to know, to remember, one’s transgressions.I won’t 
be caught at that again.I’ll leave it to this year’s damned.And now 
let us think no more about it, think no more about anything, think 
no more.He alone or they a many, all solicit me in the same tongue, 
the only one they taught me.They told me there were others, I 
don’t regret not knowing them.The moment the silence is broken 
in this way it can only mean one thing.Orders, prayers, threats, 
praise, reproach, reasons.Praise, yes, they gave me to understand 
I was making progress.Well done, sonny, that will be all for today,

But I'll have made progress, they told me so, only not enough,

had a fatal effect on my development, my lack of memory, no

mammal.I couldn’t.Always talking about mammals, in this men- 
agerie.Frankly, between ourselves, what the hell could it matter 
to pupil Mahood, that man was this rather than that?Presumably 
nothing has been lost in any case, since here it all comes slobber- 
ing out again, let loose by the nightmare.I’ll have my bellyful of 
mammals, I can see that from here, before I wake.Quick, give 
me a mother 1 and let me suck her white, pinching my tits.But it’s 
time I gave this solitary a name, nothing doing without proper 
names.I therefore baptise nim Worm.It was high time.Worm.I don’t like it, but I haven’t much choice.It will be my name too,

task of forming me and make way for another, having laid the 
foundations.He has not yet been able to speak his mind, only 
murmur, I have not ceased to hear his murmur, all the while the 
others discoursed.He has survived them all, Mahood too, if 
Mahood is dead.I can hear him yet, faithful, begging me to still 
this dead tongue of the living.I imagine that is what he says, in 
his unchanging tone.If I could be silent I would better understand 
what he wants of me, wants me to be, wants me to say.Why 
doesn’t he thunder it at me and get it over?Too easy, it is I who 
must be silent, hold my breath.But there is something wrong here.For if Mahood were silent.Worm would be silent too.That the 
impossible should be asked of me, good, what else could be asked 
of me?But the absurd !Of me whom they have reduced to reason.It is true poor Worm is not to blame for this.That’s soon said.But let me complete my views, before .T shit on them.For if I am

established moment.But perhaps I have been too hasty in oppos-

cannot be the other?Accomplices therefore.That’s the way to 
reason, warmly.Or is one to postulate a tertius gaudens, meaning 
myself, responsible for the double failure?Shall I come upon my 
true countenance at last, bathing in a smile?I have the feeling I 
shall be spared this spectacle.At no moment do I know what I’m 
talking about, nor of whom, nor of where, nor how, nor why, but 
I could employ fifty wretches for this sinister operation and still be 
short of a fifty-first, to close the circuit, that I know, without know- 
ing what it means.The essential is never to arrive anywhere, never 
to be anywhere, neither where Mahood is, nor where Worm is, nor

And indeed we have seen 
him do so, in the yard, in his jar, in a sense.I knew I had only 
to try and talk of Worm to begin talking of Mahood, with more 
felicity and understanding than ever.How close to me he suddenly 
seems, squinting up at the medals of the hippophagist Ducroix.It is the hour of the aperitif, already people pause, to read the 
menu.Charming hour of the day, particularly when, as sometimes 
happens, it is also that of, the setting sun whose last rays, raking 
the street from end to end, lend to my cenotaph an interminable 
shadow, astraddle of the gutter and the sidewalk.There was a time 
I used to contemplate it, when I was freer to turn my head than 
now, since being put in the collar.Then over there, far from me, 
I knew my head was lying, and people treading on it, and on my 
flies, which went on gliding none the less, prettily on the darkTHE UNNAMABLE

shadow, followed by long faithful trembling shadows.For some* 
times I confuse myself with my shadow, and sometimes don’t 
And sometimes I don’t confuse myself with my jar, and sometimes 
do.It all depends what mood we’re in.And often I went off look- 
ing without flinching until, ceasing to be, I ceased to see.Delicious 
instant truly, coinciding from time to time, as already observed, 
with that of the aperitif.

But this joy, which for my part I should 
have thought harmless, and without danger for the public, is some- 
thing I have to go without now that the collar holds my face turned 
towards the railings, just above the menu, for it is important that 
the prospective customer should be able to compose his meal 
without the riffle of being run over.The meat, in this quarter, has 
a high reputation, and people come from a distance, from great 
distances, on purpose to relish it.Which having done they hurry 
away.By ten o’clock in the evening all is silent, as the g^jjive, as 
they say.Such is the fruit of my observations accumulated over a 
long period of years and constantly subjected to a process of in- 
duction.Here all is killing and eating.This evening there is tripe.It’s a winter dish, or a late autumn one.Soon Marguerite will 
come and light me up.She is late.Already more than one passer- 
by has flashed his lighter under my nose the better to decipher 
what I shall now describe, by way of elegant variation, as the bill 
of fare.Please God nothing has happened to my protectress.I 
shall not hear her coming, I shall not hear her steps, because of 
the snow.I spent all morning under my cover.When the first frosts 
come she makes nr.a nest of rags, well tucked in all round me, 
to preserve me from chills.It’s snug.I wonder will she powder 
my skull this evening, with her great puff.It’s her latest invention.She’s always thinking of something new, to relieve me.If only

take place?Just this once.Almost immediately a thought presents 
itself, I should really concentrate more often.Quick let me record 
it before it vanishes.How is it the people do not notice me?I seem 
to exist for none but Madeleine.That a passer-by pressed for time, 
in headlong flight or hot pursuit, should have no eyes for me, that 
I can conceive.But the idlers come to hear the cattle’s bellows of 
pain and who, time obviously heavy on their hands, pace up and

my breath?The children on their way to and from their play- 
grounds beyond the gates, all out for a bit of fun?It seems to 
me that even a human head, recently washed and with a few hairs 
on top, should be quite a popular curiosity in the position occu- 
pied by mine.

Can it be out of discretion, and a reluctance to hurt, 
that they affect to be unaware of my existence?But this is a refine- 
ment of feeling which can hardly be attributed to the dogs that 
come jessing against my abode, apparently never doubting that it 
contains some flesh and bones.It follows therefore that I have no 
smell either.And yet if anyone should have a smell, it is I.How, 
under these conditions, can Mahood expect me to behave normally?The flies vouch for me, if you like, but how far?Would they not 
settle with equal appetite on a lump of cowshit?No, as long as 
this point is not cleared up to my satisfaction, or as long as I am 
not distinguished by some sense organs other than Madeleine’s, 
it will be impossible for me to believe, sufficiently to pursue my 
act, the things that arc told about me.I should further remark, 
with regard to this testimony which I consider indispensable, that 
I shall soon be in no fit condition to receive it, so greatly have my

without dwelling further on these macabre details, it is certain I 
was grievously mistaken in supposing that death in itself could be 
regarded as evidence, or even a strong presumption, in support

desire to leave this world, in which they keep trying to foist me, 
without some kind of assurance that I was really there, such as a 
kick in the arse, for example, or a kiss, the nature of the attention

Mahood suggests that the jar is a form of evidence against him and suggests that he should submit to the execution upon him of the sentence it entails.
The jar has been placed in a public place where it has been artistically illuminated from dusk to midnight.
There is a woman who has been lavishing attention on him for some time and has been losing faith in him.
Mahood believes that the woman is trying to put off the moment when she must confess her error by visiting him every few minutes to see if he is still more or less imaginable in situ.
He believes the belief in God is sometimes lost after a period of intensified zeal and observance.
Despite his doubts about the jar's reality, Mahood believes it is easier to raise a shrine than bring the deity down to haunt it.

drop and lie when it suffers no more, or less, or can go no further.Then the voice will begin again, low at first, then louder, coming 
from the quarter they want him to retreat from, to make him think

what is the good of talking about what they will do as soon as 
Worm sets himself in motion, so as to gather him without fail into 
their midst, since he cannot set himself in motion, though he often 
desires to, if when speaking of him one may speak of desire, and 
one may not, one should not, but there it is, that is the way to 
speak of him, that is the way to speak to him, as if he were alive, 
as if he could understand, as if he could desire, even if it serves 
no purpose, and it serves none.And it is a blessing for him he 
cannot stir, even though he suffers because of it, for it would be to 
sign his life-warrant, to stir from where he is, in search of a little 
calm and something of the silence of old.But perhaps one day he 
will stir, the day when the little effort of the early stages, infinitely 
weak, will have become, by dint of repetition, a great effort, strong 
enough to tear him from where he lies.Or perhaps one da^ they

face can do, without every ceasing to be recognisable as such,

once broken will never again be whole.Is there then no hope?Good gracious, no, heavens, what an idea!Just a faint or|p per-

only one he will depart all alone, towards his master, and His long

one who could never do, never be.Ah if only this voice could 
stop, this meaningless voice which prevents you from being nothing, 
just barely prevents you from being nothing and nowhere, just 
enough to keep alight this little yellow flame feebly darting from 
side to side, panting, as if straining to tear itself f,tom its wick,

he really existed, in a specific place, whereas the whole thing is 
no more than a project for the moment.But let them blundef on to 
the end of their folly, then they can go into the question again, 
taking care not to compromise themselves by the use of terms, 
if not of notions, accessible to the understanding.In the same way

even the presentiment of their possible reality, without all these 
blind and surly disquisitions.A little more reflection would have 
shown them that the hour to speak, far from having struck, might 
never strike.But they are compelled to speak, it is forbidden them 
to stop.Summarization models summary:
