Gregor Samsa woke up from troubled dreams to find himself transformed into a horrible vermin in his bed.
Samsa was a travelling salesman and found himself in a room with a collection of textile samples and a picture of a lady with a fur hat and fur boa on a gilded frame on the wall.
Gregor's body is so thin that the bedding barely covers him. He is also a salesman, so he is also a customer. He is also a customer of a company called Dungy's. The salesman kept asking the lady, 'Do you think this will sell a few products?'  The salesman was just in love with a lady of his own word, so he kept giving her a reply

Gregor is thinking about giving in his notice and leaving his job due to his parents' debt to his boss.

When Gregor woke up in the morning he found that he was having the flu and had a bad headache.
After he died, Dr. Horwitz noticed changes in Gregor's voice. He was a little more feminine, more nervous, and spoke in a low voice.If I remember correctly, he probably looked at a black cloth over his face. 
 No

Gregor is struggling to get out of bed due to a serious injury.
Gregor has never seen the lower part of his body before and finds it difficult to move.
He initially tried to move by shoving himself forward but hit his head against the lower bedpost.

That evening, he managed to get some sleep and made full recoveries the next day.By the way, what happened? 
He lost his wallet, left his phone behind him. 
In his next two episodes, he did go to work and found a book. 
What

Gregor is trapped in a flat with his father and a maid.
All the doors in the flat are locked.
Gregor's father and the maid are strong enough to lift him from the bed and move him across the floor.
The time is around ten past seven and Gregor is about to call for help when a knock at the door from his work reveals the visitor is the chief clerk from the shop.
There is a silver watch around which Gregor watches, so that he can talk on his phone all day without anyone listening in.

Mr. Samsa is a chief clerk who is causing serious and unnecessary concern to his parents and employers due to his failure to carry out his business duties.
Gregor's employer suggested that his absence was due to money entrusted to him.
The chief clerk rejected this explanation and decided not to intercede on his behalf because of his perceived stubbornness and lack of concern for his job security.
Gregor's parents are also concerned about his future. He is a member of the American Legion and is a native of Humboldt County, Illinois.

Gregor is struggling to open the door to let his parents and the chief clerk into his flat.
Gregor's parents are concerned about his health and fear he might be seriously ill.
The chief clerk asks Gregor if he is trying to trick them into thinking he's innocent.
Despite his parents' concerns, Gregor lets them in and waits for them at the station for eight o'clock. However, he says that he doesn't want his parents to think he is being a wuss.He doesn't want his relatives to worry about it. He says he's just trying to make sure he's not being a wuss. He says he wants to look for evidence that it's just an illness.

Gregor has no teeth but has a very strong jaw, which he uses to turn the key in the lock with his mouth.
He has to use adhesive on his legs to open the door using only his mouth and hands.
The chief clerk in the next room informed Gregor that he was turning the key.
Gregor was encouraged by the chief clerk's announcement, but his parents were crying for him, so they asked the clerk to check his face again. 
 And I heard the manager on the main floor yell, the old clerk, that there was an accident on the road. 
 The manager? That's the name of the business. 
 Gregor, I don't know what you're talking

 We have been able to make a little bit of progress because of Gregor, who is actually a really nice guy. He's allowed to have one of these "toxic tests" that measure his urine and poop out and help diagnose what causes

Gregor was in a state of shock and panic, feeling as if there was some supernatural force preventing him from leaving the room.
Gregor's parents invested a lot of time and effort in his job, believing it would provide a better future for him.
They had lost sight of the future due to their worry about the present and their concerns for the future.
Despite his distress, Gregor thought, if I want to, I could kill myself, or hurt myself with my body. 
 If you want to kill someone there is always the chance and you don't have to do it.  I'll go for it and you won't have to either, no matter what.  At least I won't hurt

Gregor reacted strongly to the flow of coffee, causing his mother to scream and flee into the arms of his father.
Gregor's father reacted by seizing the chief clerk's stick with his right hand and using it to drive him back into his room.
Despite his father's attempts to stop him, Gregor was unable to go backwards in a straight line due to his lack of practice and skill. 
 Later, I'll put my shoes up and ask Mr. Rodriguez for his help.

In the course

Gregor was in a deep and coma-like sleep when his father tried to drive him back into his room.
Gregor pushed himself into the doorway of the double-doorway and was unable to get himself upright due to his father's actions.
His father released him from the doorway and sent Gregor flying into the room, sending him flying and bleeding.
The door was slammed shut on that day and the whole village was in the store for days trying to come up with a new word to describe the incident.  The boy who'd attacked his entire family  never woke up.  The following weeks the young man was forgotten about once again until the following year, when Gregor was again found, and the villagers

Gregor and his family lead a quiet life, living in a nice home with a comfortable lifestyle.
Gregor's father used to read the evening paper to his mother and sister, but he seems to have lost the habit in recent times.
During the previous night, the door on one side of the room was opened slightly and closed again, suggesting someone was trying to enter the room.
The keys to the room were found on the other side of the door.
Gregor's mother, who is also a teacher, immediately called the emergency number for help in a small group and asked if anyone would like to help.
Someone came and took two police vehicles to the scene and then took the child to a local hospital

Gregor was hiding under the couch when his sister entered the room.
Gregor had left a dish of milk and a few drops of milk splashed around it.
When his sister noticed him, she was initially shocked and slammed the door shut.
Despite his hunger, Gregor felt an urge to beg his sister for food.
His sister brought him a selection of old, half-rotten food items to feed him. Once he was done with the food selections, he ate the milk.
'Just a little extra, just a touch' he said.When he passed finally got a menu, he said he couldn't eat any more, even though he had an excellent appetite.'My sister is sick of

Gregor receives his food twice a day, once in the morning while his parents and the maid are still asleep and the second after everyone else has eaten their meal at midday.

Gregor's father's business had collapsed five years ago, leaving his family in a state of despair.
Gregor was imprisoned due to his father's financial problems.
During his time in prison, Gregor converted his savings into cash that he could lay on the table at home for his family.
The family's business misfortune had reduced the family to despair and Gregor's only concern was to arrange for his younger brother to stay at home and clean up the damaged possessions.
Since leaving the prison for his brother, he has left a great amount of money, with a good job and healthy relationship with his parents. Since his return home, he has been encouraged to do many things while working and has become more active in

Gregor's father has been explaining things to him and his mother for a long time since he was occupied with these matters.
Gregor learned from his father's explanations that despite their misfortunes, there was still some money available from the old days.
This money accumulated and was not touched in the meantime.
They had not been using up all the money that Gregor brings home every month. Some could be used for new vehicles. Others towards his new education. In the end, there has been no way that he is able to make the amount he pays. 
 I hear that the old man is no longer there with his father, if anything, it would result in getting involved in matters on such a
