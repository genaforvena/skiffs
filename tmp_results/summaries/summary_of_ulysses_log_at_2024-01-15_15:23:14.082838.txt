[ 1 ]Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.A yellow
dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild
morning air.He held the bowl aloft and intoned:—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:—Come up, Kinch!Come up, you fearful jesuit!Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.He faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains.Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head.Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.—Back to barracks!he said sternly.He added in a preacher’s tone:—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul
and blood and ouns.

Slow music, please.Shut your eyes, gents.One
moment.A little trouble about those white corpuscles.Silence, all.He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and
there with gold points.Chrysostomos.Two strong shrill whistles
answered through the calm.—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.That will do nicely.Switch off
the current, will you?He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
about his legs the loose folds of his gown.The plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.—The mockery of it!he said gaily.Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself.Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.But it has a
Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.We
must go to Athens.Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:—Will he come?The jejune jesuit!Ceasing, he began to shave with care.—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.—Yes, my love?

Merging and summarizing: 
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.—God, isn’t he dreadful?he said frankly.A ponderous Saxon.He thinks
you’re not a gentleman.God, these bloody English!Bursting with money
and indigestion.Because he comes from Oxford.You know, Dedalus, you
have the real Oxford manner.He can’t make you out.O, my name for you
is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.He shaved warily over his chin.—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.Where is
his guncase?—A woful lunatic!Mulligan said.Were you in a funk?—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.Out here in the dark
with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther.You saved men from drowning.I’m not a hero, however.If
he stays on here I am off.Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.He hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.—Scutter!he cried thickly.He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
pocket, said:—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief.Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:—The bard’s noserag!A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.You can almost taste it, can’t you?

He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
oakpale hair stirring slightly.—God!he said quietly.Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
mother?The snotgreen sea.The scrotumtightening sea._Epi oinopa
ponton_.Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks!I must teach you.You must read them
in the original._Thalatta!Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.Come and look.Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.Leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
Kingstown.—Our mighty mother!Buck Mulligan said.He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
face.—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.That’s why she won’t
let me have anything to do with you.—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother
asked you, Buck Mulligan said.I’m hyperborean as much as you.But to
think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and
pray for her.And you refused.There is something sinister in you....He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.A tolerant
smile curled his lips.—But a lovely mummer!he murmured to himself.Kinch, the loveliest
mummer of them all!He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.

Merging and summarizing: 
Silently,
in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within
its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,
her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes.Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.The ring of bay and
skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.A bowl of white china had
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.—Ah, poor dogsbody!he said in a kind voice.I must give you a shirt
and a few noserags.How are the secondhand breeks?—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.Secondleg they should be.God
knows what poxy bowsy left them off.I have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey.You’ll look spiffing in them.I’m not joking, Kinch.You
look damn well when you’re dressed.—Thanks, Stephen said.I can’t wear them if they are grey.—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.Etiquette is etiquette.He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
trousers.He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.

—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,
says you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.General paralysis of the insane!He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings
abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.His curling shaven lips
laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.Laughter seized
all his strong wellknit trunk.—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack.Hair on end.As he and others see me.Who chose this
face for me?This dogsbody to rid of vermin.It asks me too.—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.It does her
all right.The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.Lead him not into temptation.And her name is Ursula.Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.If
Wilde were only alive to see you!Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:—It is a symbol of Irish art.The cracked lookingglass of a servant.Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
had thrust them.—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?he said kindly.God knows you have more spirit than any of them.Parried again.He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.The
cold steel pen.—Cracked lookingglass of a servant!

Tell that to the oxy chap
downstairs and touch him for a guinea.He’s stinking with money and
thinks you’re not a gentleman.His old fellow made his tin by selling
jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.God, Kinch, if you and
I could only work together we might do something for the island.Hellenise it.Cranly’s arm.His arm.—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.I’m the only one
that knows what you are.Why don’t you trust me more?What have you up
your nose against me?Is it Haines?If he makes any noise here I’ll
bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
Clive Kempthorpe.Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.Palefaces:
they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.O, I shall
expire!Break the news to her gently, Aubrey!I shall die!With slit
ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
tailor’s shears.A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.I don’t
want to be debagged!Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.A deaf
gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.—Let him stay, Stephen said.

There’s nothing wrong with him except at
night.—Then what is it?Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.Cough it up.I’m
quite frank with you.What have you against me now?They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on
the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.Stephen freed his arm
quietly.—Do you wish me to tell you?he asked.—Yes, what is it?Buck Mulligan answered.I don’t remember anything.He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.A light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
anxiety in his eyes.Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
death?Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:—What?Where?I can’t remember anything.I remember only ideas and
sensations.Why?What happened in the name of God?—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get
more hot water.Your mother and some visitor came out of the
drawingroom.She asked you who was in your room.—Yes?Buck Mulligan said.What did I say?I forget.—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead._A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
Mulligan’s cheek.—Did I say that?he asked.Well?What harm is that?He shook his constraint from him nervously.—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?You saw
only your mother die.

I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.It’s a beastly
thing and nothing else.It simply doesn’t matter.You wouldn’t kneel
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.Why?Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected
the wrong way.To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.Her cerebral lobes
are not functioning.She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
buttercups off the quilt.Humour her till it’s over.You crossed her
last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
some hired mute from Lalouette’s.Absurd!I suppose I did say it.I
didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.He had spoken himself into boldness.Stephen, shielding the gaping
wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.—Of what then?Buck Mulligan asked.—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.—O, an impossible person!he exclaimed.He walked off quickly round the parapet.Stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.Sea and headland now
grew dim.Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he
felt the fever of his cheeks.A voice within the tower called loudly:—Are you up there, Mulligan?—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.He turned towards Stephen and said:—Look at the sea.What does it care about offences?

Chuck Loyola,
Kinch, and come on down.The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
with the roof:—Don’t mope over it all day, he said.I’m inconsequent.Give up the
moody brooding.His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
the stairhead:     And no more turn aside and brood
     Upon love’s bitter mystery
     For Fergus rules the brazen cars.Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
stairhead seaward where he gazed.Inshore and farther out the mirror of
water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.White breast of the
dim sea.The twining stresses, two by two.A hand plucking the
harpstrings, merging their twining chords.Wavewhite wedded words
shimmering on the dim tide.A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
deeper green.It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.Fergus’
song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.Silent with awe and
pity I went to her bedside.She was crying in her wretched bed.For
those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.Where now?Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.A birdcage hung in the
sunny window of her house when she was a girl.

Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.Memories beset his

approached the sacrament.A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.Her shapely
fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
shirts.In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.On
me alone.The ghostcandle to light her agony.Ghostly light on the
tortured face.Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all
prayed on their knees.Her eyes on me to strike me down._Liliata

chorus excipiat._Ghoul!Chewer of corpses!No, mother!Let me be and let me live.—Kinch ahoy!Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.It came nearer up the
staircase, calling again.Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.

—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.Breakfast is ready.Haines is
apologising for waking us last night.It’s all right.—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.For my sake and for all our
sakes.His head disappeared and reappeared.—I told him your symbol of Irish art.He says it’s very clever.Touch
him for a quid, will you?A guinea, I mean.—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.—The school kip?Buck Mulligan said.How much?Four quid?Lend us one.—If you want it, Stephen said.—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.We’ll have
a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.Four omnipotent
sovereigns.He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
tune with a Cockney accent:     O, won’t we have a merry time,
     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!On coronation,
     Coronation day!O, won’t we have a merry time
     On coronation day!Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.The nickel shavingbowl shone,
forgotten, on the parapet.Why should I bring it down?Or leave it
there all day, forgotten friendship?He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.I am another now
and yet the same.A servant too.A server of a servant.

In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow.Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.Haines, open that door, will you?Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.A tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
the inner doors.—Have you the key?a voice asked.—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.Janey Mack, I’m choked!He howled, without looking up from the fire:—Kinch!—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.Haines stood at the
doorway, looking out.Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
sat down to wait.Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him.Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...But, hush!Not a
word more on that subject!Kinch, wake up!Bread, butter, honey.Haines, come in.The grub is ready.Bless us, O Lord, and these thy
gifts.Where’s the sugar?O, jay, there’s no milk.

Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
the locker.Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.—What sort of a kip is this?he said.I told her to come after eight.—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.There’s a lemon in the
locker.—O, damn you and your Paris fads!Buck Mulligan said.I want Sandycove
milk.Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:—That woman is coming up with the milk.—The blessings of God on you!Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair.Sit down.Pour out the tea there.The sugar is in the bag.Here,
I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._Haines sat down to pour out the tea.—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.But, I say, Mulligan, you do
make strong tea, don’t you?Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old
woman’s wheedling voice:—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.And when I
makes water I makes water.—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she._Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God
send you don’t make them in the one pot._He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.

brows:—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken
of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.—Do you now?Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.Your reasons, pray?—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
Mabinogion.Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.—Charming!he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth
and blinking his eyes pleasantly.Do you think she was?Quite charming!Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:_—For old Mary AnnShe doesn’t care a damn.But, hising up her petticoats..._He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.The doorway was darkened by an entering form.—The milk, sir!—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said.Kinch, get the jug.An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.Glory be to God.—To whom?Mulligan said, glancing at her.Ah, to be sure!Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.

—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
the collector of prepuces.—How much, sir?asked the old woman.—A quart, Stephen said.He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
milk, not hers.Old shrunken paps.She poured again a measureful and a
tilly.Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a
messenger.She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on
her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.They
lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.Silk of the kine and
poor old woman, names given her in old times.A wandering crone, lowly
form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their
common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.To serve or to
upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.—Taste it, sir, she said.He drank at her bidding.—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts.Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved
with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.—Are you a medical student, sir?the old woman asked.—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.—Look at that now, she said.Stephen listened in scornful silence.

She bows her old head to a voice
that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
slights.To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.And to the loud voice that now bids
her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.—Do you understand what he says?Stephen asked her.—Is it French you are talking, sir?the old woman said to Haines.Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.Is there Gaelic on you?—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.Are you from the
west, sir?—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak
Irish in Ireland.—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak
the language myself.I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.Wonderful entirely.Fill
us out some more tea, Kinch.Would you like a cup, ma’am?—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.Haines said to her:—Have you your bill?We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?Stephen filled again the three cups.—Bill, sir?she said, halting.

Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.That’s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search
his trouser pockets.—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk.Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:—A miracle!He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:—Ask nothing more of me, sweet.All I can give you I give.Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.—We’ll owe twopence, he said.—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.Time enough.Good
morning, sir.She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:_—Heart of my heart, were it more,More would be laid at your feet._He turned to Stephen and said:—Seriously, Dedalus.I’m stony.Hurry out to your school kip and bring

—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.Speaking to me.They wash and tub and scrub.Agenbite of inwit.Conscience.Yet here’s a spot.—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of Irish art is deuced good.Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with
warmth of tone:—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.I was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.—Would I make any money by it?Stephen asked.Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:—I don’t know, I’m sure.He strolled out to the doorway.Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen
and said with coarse vigour:—You put your hoof in it now.What did you say that for?—Well?Stephen said.The problem is to get money.From whom?From the
milkwoman or from him.It’s a toss up, I think.—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.—From me, Kinch, he said.

In a suddenly changed tone he added:—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.Damn all else they
are good for.Why don’t you play them as I do?To hell with them all.Let us get out of the kip.He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.He emptied his pockets on to the table.—There’s your snotrag, he said.And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.His hands plunged and
rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.God,
we’ll simply have to dress the character.I want puce gloves and green
boots.Contradiction.Do I contradict myself?Very well then, I
contradict myself.Mercurial Malachi.A limp black missile flew out of
his talking hands.—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.Stephen picked it up and put it on.Haines called to them from the
doorway:—Are you coming, you fellows?—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.Come out,
Kinch.You have eaten all we left, I suppose.Resigned he passed out
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:—And going forth he met Butterly.Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it.He put the huge key in his inner pocket.At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:—Did you bring the key?

bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.—Down, sir!How dare you, sir!Haines asked:—Do you pay rent for this tower?—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.Martello you call it?—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
the sea.But ours is the _omphalos_.—What is your idea of Hamlet?Haines asked Stephen.—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.Wait till I
have a few pints in me first.He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.Is it some paradox?—Pooh!Buck Mulligan said.We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.It’s quite simple.He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is
Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.—What?Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.He himself?Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:

—O, shade of Kinch the elder!Japhet in search of a father!—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.And it is
rather long to tell.Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this
tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore._That
beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did
not speak.In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in
cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
tacking by the Muglins.—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.The Father and the Son idea.The Son striving to be atoned with the
Father.Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.He looked
at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.He moved
a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.

But have to drink water and wish it were plain
That I make when the wine becomes water again._He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running
forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like
fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:_—Goodbye, now, goodbye!Write down all I said
And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
said:—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.He’s rather blasphemous.I’m not a
believer myself, that is to say.Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
it somehow, doesn’t it?What did he call it?Joseph the Joiner?—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.—You’re not a believer, are you?Haines asked.I mean, a believer in
the narrow sense of the word.Creation from nothing and miracles and a
personal God.

—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
green stone.He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.He put it back in his
sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.Either you believe or
you don’t, isn’t it?Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
personal God.You don’t stand for that, I suppose?—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
example of free thought.He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
side.Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen!A wavering line
along the path.They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.He wants that key.It is mine.I paid the rent.Now I eat his salt
bread.Give him the key too.All.He will ask for it.That was in his
eyes.—After all, Haines began...Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was
not all unkind.—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.You are your
own master, it seems to me.—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an

the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
spoke.—I can quite understand that, he said calmly.An Irishman must think
like that, I daresay.We feel in England that we have treated you
rather unfairly.It seems history is to blame.The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam
ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own
rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.Symbol of the apostles in the mass
for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in
affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church
militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.A horde of heresies
fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom
Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning
Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who
held that the Father was Himself His own Son.Words Mulligan had spoken
a moment since in mockery to the stranger.Idle mockery.

The void
awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a
worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who
defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their
shields.Hear, hear!Prolonged applause._Zut!Nom de Dieu!_—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one.I
don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,

the spur of rock a blowing red face.He scrambled up by the stones,
water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
sagging loincloth.Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and
lips and breastbone.—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock.Chucked medicine and going in for the army.—Ah, go to God!Buck Mulligan said.—Going over next week to stew.You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?—Yes.—Spooning with him last night on the pier.The father is rotto with
money.—Is she up the pole?—Better ask Seymour that.—Seymour a bleeding officer!Buck Mulligan said.He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:—Redheaded women buck like goats.He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless
Kinch and I, the supermen.He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.—Are you going in here, Malachi?—Yes.Make room in the bed.The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the
middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.Haines sat down on a
stone, smoking.—Are you not coming in?Buck Mulligan asked.—Later on, Haines said.

Not on my breakfast.Stephen turned away.—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.Stephen handed him the key.Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.—And twopence, he said, for a pint.Throw it there.Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.Dressing, undressing.Buck

Kingstown pier, sir.Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.Two in the back bench
whispered.Yes.They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.All.With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.Their
likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets

drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.What then?A
jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
clement master’s praise.Why had they chosen all that part?Not wholly
for the smooth caress.For them too history was a tale like any other
too often heard, their land a pawnshop.Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
been knifed to death.They are not to be thought away.Time has branded
them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
possibilities they have ousted.But can those have been possible seeing
that they never were?Or was that only possible which came to pass?Weave, weaver of the wind.—Tell us a story, sir.—O, do, sir.A ghoststory.—Where do you begin in this?Stephen asked, opening another book.—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.—Go on then, Talbot.—And the story, sir?—After, Stephen said.Go on, Talbot.

and damp as a snail’s bed.He held out his copybook.The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with

to you, sir.Stephen touched the edges of the book.Futility.—Do you understand how to do them now?he asked.—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.Mr Deasy said I was to
copy them off the board, sir.—Can you do them yourself?Stephen asked.—No, sir.Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
snail’s bed.Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
her heart.But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.She had loved his weak watery
blood drained from her own.Was that then real?The only true thing in
life?His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
bestrode.She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.She had saved him from
being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.

A poor
soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red
reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the
earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.He proves by
algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather.Sargent
peered askance through his slanted glasses.Hockeysticks rattled in the
lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.Give hands,
traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.Gone too from
the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and
movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the
world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not
comprehend.—Do you understand now?Can you work the second for yourself?—Yes, sir.In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.Waiting always for a
word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint
hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin._Amor matris:_ subjective
and objective genitive.With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had
fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.My

cried sternly:—What is the matter?What is it now?Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms

cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and
this, the scallop of saint James.An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead
treasure, hollow shells.A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.These are handy things to have.See.This is for sovereigns.This is

Wales.—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time.I remember the famine

I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.—Mrkrgnao!the cat said loudly.She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively
and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.He watched the dark eyeslits
narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.Then he went to
the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him,
poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.—Gurrhr!she cried, running to lap.He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
three times and licked lightly.Wonder is it true if you clip them they
can’t mouse after.Why?They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.Or
kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.He listened to her licking lap.Ham and eggs, no.No good eggs with
this drouth.Want pure fresh water.Thursday: not a good day either for
a mutton kidney at Buckley’s.Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s.While the kettle is boiling.She
lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.Why are their tongues so
rough?To lap better, all porous holes.Nothing she can eat?He glanced
round him.No.On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
the bedroom door.She might like something tasty.Thin bread and butter
she likes in the morning.Still perhaps: once in a way.He said softly in the bare hall:—I’m going round the corner.Be back in a minute.And when he had heard his voice say it he added:

—You don’t want anything for breakfast?A sleepy soft grunt answered:—Mn.No.She didn’t want anything.He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.Must get those settled really.Pity.All the way from Gibraltar.Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.Wonder what her father gave for
it.Old style.Ah yes!of course.Bought it at the governor’s auction.Got a short knock.Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.Yes, sir.At
Plevna that was.I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.Still
he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.Now that was
farseeing.His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat
and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.Stamps: stickyback
pictures.Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.Course they do.The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s
high grade ha.He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.White
slip of paper.Quite safe.On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.Not there.In the trousers I left off.Must get it.Potato I have.Creaky
wardrobe.No use disturbing her.She turned over sleepily that time.He
pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf
dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.Looked shut.All right
till I come back anyhow.He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
seventyfive.The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church.

he walked in happy warmth.Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our
daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.Makes you feel young.Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
dawn.Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him.Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.Walk along a
strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker
too, old Tweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.Wander through awned streets.Turbaned faces going by.Dark caves of
carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking
a coiled pipe.Cries of sellers in the streets.Drink water scented
with fennel, sherbet.Dander along all day.Might meet a robber or two.Well, meet him.Getting on to sundown.The shadows of the mosques among
the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.A shiver of the trees,
signal, the evening wind.I pass on.Fading gold sky.A mother watches
me from her doorway.She calls her children home in their dark
language.High wall: beyond strings twanged.Night sky, moon, violet,
colour of Molly’s new garters.Strings.Listen.A girl playing one of
those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.I pass.

Probably not a bit like it really.Kind of stuff you read: in the track
of the sun.Sunburst on the titlepage.He smiled, pleasing himself.What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_
leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway
behind the bank of Ireland.He prolonged his pleased smile.Ikey touch
that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.He approached Larry O’Rourke’s.From the cellar grating floated up the
flabby gush of porter.Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.Good house, however: just the
end of the city traffic.For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as
position.Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular
from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.Baldhead over the blind.Cute old codger.No use canvassing him for an
ad.Still he knows his own business best.There he is, sure enough, my
bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.Simon Dedalus takes him
off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.Do you know what I’m going to
tell you?What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?Do you know what?The Russians,
they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.Sad thing about poor

beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a
palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled
switches in their hands.He held the page aslant patiently, bending his

go to the trottingmatches.She listens with big dark soft eyes.Tell
her: more and more: all.Then a sigh: silence.Long long long rest.Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly

eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of
porter.One and four into twenty: fifteen about.Yes, exactly.Fifteen
millions of barrels of porter.What am I saying barrels?Gallons.About a million barrels all the
same.An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.

The
bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing
together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy
pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.Stepping into the
porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it
again behind the leather headband.Damn it.I might have tried to work
M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.Same notice on the door.Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J.

true religion.Save China’s millions.Wonder how they explain it to the
heathen Chinee.Prefer an ounce of opium.Celestials.Rank heresy for
them.Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.Taking it easy
with hand under his cheek.Josssticks burning.Not like Ecce Homo.Crown of thorns and cross.Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.Chopsticks?Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of
that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t.They’re taught that.He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to
baptise blacks, is he?The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced,
listening.Still life.

Merged Summary: 
The conversation takes place in a quiet dusk at a place where one person is getting food: fruit, olives, water from a well, and a paper goblet from a hole in the wall at Ashtown.
One of the characters, a man named Henry Flower, has a paper envelope that can tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds and scatter it towards the road.

music.That woman at midnight mass.Seventh heaven.Women knelt in the
benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.A batch
knelt at the altarrails.The priest went along by them, murmuring,
holding the thing in his hands.He stopped at each, took out a
communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?)off it and put it
neatly into her mouth.Her hat and head sank.Then the next one.Her
hat sank at once.Then the next one: a small old woman.The priest bent
down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.Latin.The next
one.Shut your eyes and open your mouth.What?_Corpus:_ body.Corpse.Good idea the Latin.Stupefies them first.Hospice for the dying.They
don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.Rum idea: eating bits of a
corpse.Why the cannibals cotton to it.He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by
one, and seek their places.He approached a bench and seated himself in
its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.These pots we have to wear.We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.They were about him here
and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
it to melt in their stomachs.

Something like those mazzoth: it’s that
sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.Look at them.Now I bet it makes
them feel happy.Lollipop.It does.Yes, bread of angels it’s called.There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you
feel.First communicants.Hokypoky penny a lump.Then feel all like one
family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.They do.I’m
sure of that.Not so lonely.In our confraternity.Then come out a bit
spreeish.Let off steam.Thing is if you really believe in it.Lourdes
cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.Hence those snores.Blind
faith.Safe in the arms of kingdom come.Lulls all pain.Wake this time
next year.He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an
instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
affair he had on.Suppose he lost the pin of his.He wouldn’t know what
to do to.Bald spot behind.Letters on his back: I.N.R.I?No: I.H.S.Molly told me one time I asked her.I have sinned: or no: I have
suffered, it is.And the other one?Iron nails ran in.Meet one Sunday after the rosary.Do not deny my request.Turn up with

the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.At walking pace.They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were

rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
rattling in the doorframes.—What way is he taking us?Mr Power asked through both windows.—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.Ringsend.Brunswick street.Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.—That’s a fine old custom, he said.I am glad to see it has not died
out.All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
passers.Respect.The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
smoother road past Watery lane.Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
clad in mourning, a wide hat.—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.—Who is that?—Your son and heir.—Where is he?Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.

The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.Mr Dedalus
fell back, saying:—Was that Mulligan cad with him?His _fidus Achates_!—No, Mr Bloom said.He was alone.—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump
of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.Wallace Bros: the
bottleworks: Dodder bridge.Richie Goulding and the legal bag.Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
the firm.His jokes are getting a bit damp.Great card he was.Waltzing
in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
landlady’s two hats pinned on his head.Out on the rampage all night.Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.Wife
ironing his back.Thinks he’ll cure it with pills.All breadcrumbs they
are.About six hundred per cent profit.—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.That Mulligan is a
contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.His name stinks
all over Dublin.But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll
make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a
gate.I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.

He cried above the clatter of the wheels:—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.A counterjumper’s
son.Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s.Not likely.He ceased.Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild
face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.Noisy
selfwilled man.Full of his son.He is right.Something to hand on.If
little Rudy had lived.See him grow up.Hear his voice in the house.Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.My son.Me in his eyes.Strange
feeling it would be.From me.Just a chance.Must have been that
morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs
at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.And the sergeant grinning
up.She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.Give us
a touch, Poldy.God, I’m dying for it.How life begins.Got big then.Had to refuse the Greystones concert.My son inside her.I could have helped him on in life.I could.Make him independent.Learn German too.—Are we late?Mr Power asked.—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.Molly.Milly.Same thing watered down.Her tomboy oaths.O jumping
Jupiter!Ye gods and little fishes!Still, she’s a dear girl.Soon be a
woman.Mullingar.Dearest Papli.Young student.Yes, yes: a woman too.Life, life.The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.

him off to his face.—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.Wait till you hear
him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously._His singing of that simple
ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
whole course of my experience._—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.He’s dead nuts on that.And the
retrospective arrangement.—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech?Martin Cunningham asked.

deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
Peake is that?is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s?no, Sexton,
Urbright.Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.Thanks to the Little Flower.Sadly missed.To the inexpressible grief

Quinlan.On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.     It is now a month since dear Henry fled
     To his home up above in the sky
     While his family weeps and mourns his loss
     Hoping some day to meet him on high.I tore up the envelope?Yes.Where did I put her letter after I read it
in the bath?He patted his waistcoatpocket.There all right.Dear Henry
fled.Before my patience are exhausted.National school.Meade’s yard.The hazard.Only two there now.Nodding.Full as a tick.Too much bone in their skulls.The other trotting round
with a fare.An hour ago I was passing there.The jarvies raised their
hats.A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window.Couldn’t they invent something
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?

Well but that fellow
would lose his job then?Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention?Antient concert rooms.Nothing on there.A man in a buff suit with a
crape armlet.Not much grief there.Quarter mourning.People in law
perhaps.They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway
bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence.Hoardings: Eugene
Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I
wonder.I said I.Or the _Lily of Killarney_?Elster Grimes Opera
Company.Big powerful change.Wet bright bills for next week._Fun on
the Bristol_.Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.Have
to stand a drink or two.As broad as it’s long.He’s coming in the afternoon.Her songs.Plasto’s.Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust.Who was he?—How do you do?Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
salute.—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said.Yes, he does.How do you do?—Who?Mr Dedalus asked.—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.There he is airing his quiff.Just that moment I was thinking.Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.From the door of the Red Bank the
white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
hand.The nails, yes.Is there anything more in him that they she sees?Fascination.Worst man in Dublin.That keeps him alive.They sometimes
feel what a person is.Instinct.But a type like that.My nails.

county Clare on some private business.You see the idea is to tour the
chief towns.What you lose on one you can make up on the other.—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.Mary Anderson is up there now.Have you good artists?—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.O yes, we’ll have all

the son.—About the boatman?Mr Power asked.—Yes.Isn’t it awfully good?—What is that?Mr Dedalus asked.I didn’t hear it.—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to
send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were

to drown.....—Drown Barabbas!Mr Dedalus cried.I wish to Christ he did!Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.—For God’s sake!Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.Is he dead?—Dead!Martin Cunningham cried.Not he!

A boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive.Half the town was there.—Yes, Mr Bloom said.But the funny part is.....—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
saving his son’s life.A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.Like a hero.A silver florin.—Isn’t it awfully good?Mr Bloom said eagerly.—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.Nelson’s pillar.—Eight plums a penny!Eight for a penny!—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.Mr Dedalus sighed.—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.Many a good one he told himself.—The Lord forgive me!Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
fingers.Poor Paddy!I little thought a week ago when I saw him last
and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.He’s gone from us.—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.He went
very suddenly.—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.Heart.He tapped his chest sadly.Blazing face: redhot.Too much John Barleycorn.Cure for a red nose.Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.A lot of money he spent

municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.Run the line
out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage

granite block.The waggoner marching at their head saluted.Coffin now.Got here before us, dead as he is.Horse looking round at

candles at its corners.Always in front of us.Corny Kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.The mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks.Mr Bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.He fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.

A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a

one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s
belly.Who’ll read the book?I, said the rook.They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book

mass.Crape weepers.Blackedged notepaper.Your name on the altarlist.Chilly place this.Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning
in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.Eyes of a
toad too.What swells him up that way?Molly gets swelled after
cabbage.Air of the place maybe.Looks full up of bad gas.Must be an
infernal lot of bad gas round the place.Butchers, for instance: they
get like raw beefsteaks.Who was telling me?Mervyn Browne.Down in the
vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have
to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn

beside her.Let Him take me whenever He likes.Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk.Mr Power took his arm.—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.I suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven.Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.I suppose we can

impressive I must say.Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.The language of course was another thing.Mr Kernan said with solemnity:—_I am the resurrection and the life_.That touches a man’s inmost
heart.—It does, Mr Bloom said.Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two

Mr Kernan assured him.—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?John Henry Menton asked.I

seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown.And a good
armful she was.He looked behind through the others.—What is he?he asked.What does he do?Wasn’t he in the stationery

Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.The
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.They asked for
Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.After
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.One of the
drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.The other drunk was
blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.He
resumed:—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like
the man_, says he._That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher,
accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as
he walked.—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.—I know, Hynes said.I know that.—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.It’s pure
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk.All want to be on
good terms with him.

Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.No passout
checks._Habeas corpus_.I must see about that ad after the funeral.Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she
disturbed me writing to Martha?Hope it’s not chucked in the dead
letter office.Be the better of a shave.Grey sprouting beard.That’s
the first sign when the hairs come out grey.And temper getting cross.Silver threads among the grey.Fancy being his wife.Wonder he had the
gumption to propose to any girl.Come out and live in the graveyard.Dangle that before her.It might thrill her first.Courting death.Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.The
shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be
a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy
man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.Will o’
the wisp.Gas of graves.Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at
all.Women especially are so touchy.Tell her a ghost story in bed to
make her sleep.Have you ever seen a ghost?Well, I have.It was a
pitchdark night.The clock was on the stroke of twelve.Still they’d
kiss all right if properly keyed up.Whores in Turkish graveyards.Learn anything if taken young.You might pick up a young widow here.Men like that.Love among the tombstones.Romeo.Spice of pleasure.In

—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
ad of Keyes’s.Want to fix it up.They tell me he’s round there in
Dillon’s.He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.The editor who,

blowing them apart gently, without comment.—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.Look at the young scamps
after him.—Show.Where?Lenehan cried, running to the window.A STREET CORTÈGE
Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
tail of white bowknots.—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said,
and you’ll kick.O, my rib risible!Taking off his flat spaugs and the

He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his
receiving hands.—What’s that?Myles Crawford said with a start.Where are the other two
gone?—Who?the professor said, turning.They’re gone round to the Oval for a
drink.Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.Came over last night.—Come on then, Myles Crawford said.Where’s my hat?He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.They jingled then in the
air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.—Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.Who has the
most matches?THE CALUMET OF PEACE
He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.Lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.J.
J. O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.He
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:     ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
     ’Twas empire charmed thy heart.The professor grinned, locking his long lips.—Eh?You bloody old Roman empire?Myles Crawford said.He took a cigarette from the open case.

Lenehan, lighting it for him
with quick grace, said:—Silence for my brandnew riddle!—_Imperium romanum_, J. J. O’Molloy said gently.It sounds nobler than
British or Brixton.The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.—That’s it, he said.We are the fat.You and I are the fat in the fire.We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME
—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.We
mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words.We think of Rome,
imperial, imperious, imperative.He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:—What was their civilisation?Vast, I allow: but vile.Cloacae: sewers.The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to
be here.Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.The Roman, like the
Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on
which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal
obsession.He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to
be here.Let us construct a watercloset._—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.Our old ancient
ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial
to the running stream.—They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured.But we have
also Roman law.

Magennis.Speaking about me.What did he say?What did he say?What did he say
about me?Don’t ask.

—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.Wait a moment.Let me say one thing.The finest display of oratory I
ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
society.Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.Then you can imagine the style of his

full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely

therefore worthless.He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an
outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
focus.IMPROMPTU
In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.That he had

unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
withering hair.Still seeking, he said:—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.He raised his head firmly.His eyes bethought themselves once more.Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.He began:_—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in
listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment
since by my learned friend.It seemed to me that I had been transported
into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this
age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the
speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful
Moses._His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech._And let our
crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.Look out.Could you try your hand
at it yourself?_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian
highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.I heard
his words and their meaning was revealed to me._FROM THE FATHERS
It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are
corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they
were good could be corrupted.Ah, curse you!That’s saint Augustine.

_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
language?You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
furrow the waters of the known globe.You have but emerged from
primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
history and a polity._Nile.Child, man, effigy.By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone._—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.Israel is
weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
arms.Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
our name._A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.He lifted his voice above it
boldly:_—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never
have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor
followed the pillar of the cloud by day.He would never have spoken
with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have
come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and
bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of
the outlaw._

suggest that the house do now adjourn?—You take my breath away.It is not perchance a French compliment?Mr

J. J. O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:—I hope you will live to see it published.Myles, one moment.He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.—Come along, Stephen, the professor said.That is fine, isn’t it?It
has the prophetic vision._Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.Kingdoms of this world.The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen
today.The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
rushed out into the street, yelling:—Racing special!Dublin.I have much, much to learn.They turned to the left along Abbey street.—I have a vision too, Stephen said.—Yes?the professor said, skipping to get into step.Crawford will

with the blade of a knife.Two and three in silver and one and seven in
coppers.They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.LIFE ON THE RAW
—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate
Collins, proprietress...They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from
a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the
brawn.They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile
and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting,
encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the
other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin,
threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.Glory be to God.They had no idea it was that high.Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.Anne Kearns has the
lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who
got a bottleful from a passionist father.Florence MacCabe takes a
crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.

—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.Vestal virgins.I can
see them.What’s keeping our friend?He turned.A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all

—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.I spoke with Mr Keyes
just now.He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says.After he’ll
see.But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the
Saturday pink.And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told
councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.I can have access to it
in the national library.House of keys, don’t you see?His name is

—He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his

—_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.I’m up to

back a bill for me no later than last week.Sorry, Jack.You must take
the will for the deed.With a heart and a half if I could raise the
wind anyhow.J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.They caught
up on the others and walked abreast.

—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty
fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the
railings.—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.Two old
Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID
—That’s new, Myles Crawford said.That’s copy.Out for the waxies’
Dargle.Two old trickies, what?—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.They see
the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’
blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s.But it makes them
giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES
—Easy all, Myles Crawford said.No poetic licence.We’re in the
archdiocese here.—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue
of the onehandled adulterer.—Onehandled adulterer!the professor cried.I like that.I see the
idea.I see what you mean.DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF
—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too
tired to look up or down or to speak.They put the bag of plums between
them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with
their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and
spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.

to us ideas, formless spiritual essences.The supreme question about a
work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.The painting of
Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas.The deepest poetry of Shelley,
the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal
wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas.All the rest is the speculation of
schoolboys for schoolboys.A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer.Wall, tarnation strike

grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle
with Plato.—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his
commonwealth?Unsheathe your dagger definitions.Horseness is the whatness of
allhorse.Streams of tendency and eons they worship.God: noise in the
street: very peripatetic.Space: what you damn well have to see.Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they
creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this
vegetable world is but a shadow.Hold to the now, the here, through
which all future plunges to the past.Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.

distressingly shortsighted in some matters.Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.Not
for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
spitting in his palms.Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one.Our Father who art in purgatory.Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot.The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the
concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.     Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none

into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
manners.Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
lies from virgin Dublin.Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_,
returning to the world that has forgotten him?Who is King Hamlet?John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.Lifted.—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
swift glance their hearing.The flag is up on the playhouse by the
bankside.The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
groundlings.Local colour.Work in all you know.Make them accomplices.—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks
by the swanmews along the riverbank.But he does not stay to feed the
pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.The swan of Avon
has other thoughts.Composition of place.Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!—The play begins.A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.It is
the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare
who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not
vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.

young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises:
you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is
the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
impatiently.Art thou there, truepenny?—Interesting only to the parish clerk.I mean, we have the plays.I

closed when he lay on his deathbed.Mother’s deathbed.Candle.The sheeted mirror.Who brought me into this

—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.—Bosh!Stephen said rudely.A man of genius makes no mistakes.His
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine.What useful discovery did Socrates learn
from Xanthippe?—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world.What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit
nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever
know.But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him
from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.—But Ann Hathaway?Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully.Yes, we seem
to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to
chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard,
guiltless though maligned.—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
_The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we
should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of
hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.

That memory, _Venus
and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.Is
Katharine the shrew illfavoured?Hortensio calls her young and
beautiful.Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a
passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose
the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?Good: he left her
and gained the world of men.But his boywomen are the women of a boy.Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.He chose badly?He
was chosen, it seems to me.If others have their will Ann hath a way.By cock, she was to blame.She put the comether on him, sweet and
twentysix.The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping
to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford
wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.And my turn?When?Come!—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
brightly.He murmured then with blond delight for all:     Between the acres of the rye
     These pretty countryfolk would lie.Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
cooperative watch.—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._Whither away?Exploitable ground.—Are you going?John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked.Shall we see you
at Moore’s tonight?Piper is coming.—Piper!Mr Best piped.Is Piper back?

I feel we are.The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.I hope
you will come round tonight.Bring Starkey.Stephen sat down.The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.Blushing, his mask
said:—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?Alarmed face asks me.Why did he come?Courtesy or an inward light?—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
first a sundering.—Yes.Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
from hue and cry.Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.Women
he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
bully tapsters’ wives.Fox and geese.And in New Place a slack
dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
grave and unforgiven.—Yes.So you think...The door closed behind the outgoer.Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and
brooding air.A vestal’s lamp.Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do
had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of
the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore
when he lived among women.Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.

And I heard the voice
of that Egyptian highpriest._In painted chambers loaded with
tilebooks._They are still.Once quick in the brains of men.Still: but an itch of
death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
their will.—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
enigmatic.We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.Not even so
much.Others abide our question.A shadow hangs over all the rest.—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it?Mr Best pleaded.I mean, a kind
of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life.I mean, I don’t
care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
defiance.His private papers in the original._Ta an bad ar an tir.Taim in mo shagart_.Put beurla on it, littlejohn.Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I
may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.Bear with me.Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
wrinkled brows.A basilisk._E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca_.Messer
Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,

artist weave and unweave his image.

And as the mole on my right breast
is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of
new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father
the image of the unliving son looks forth.In the intense instant of
imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which
I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to
be.So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit
here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.—Yes, Mr Best said youngly.I feel Hamlet quite young.The bitterness
might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
the son.Has the wrong sow by the lug.He is in my father.I am in his son.—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug
in the market.The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan
admired so much breathe another spirit.—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
sundering.Said that.—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_
look to see when and how the shadow lifts.What softens the heart of a
man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
prince of Tyre?

Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
quantity, John Eglinton detected.The highroads are dreary but they
lead to the town.Good Bacon: gone musty.Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats.Cypherjugglers
going the highroads.Seekers on the great quest.What town, good
masters?Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.East of the
sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_.Booted the twain and staved.     How many miles to Dublin?Three score and ten, sir.Will we be there by candlelight?—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
period.—Does he?What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
name is, say of it?—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
that which was lost.What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s
child._My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any
man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur._L’art d’être
grand_...—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,

—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
all experience, material and moral.Such an appeal will touch him.The
images of other males of his blood will repel him.He will see in them
grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
the public.And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr
George Bernard Shaw.Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.His articles
on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.Oddly
enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of
the sonnets.The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.I
own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more
in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have
been.Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg,
prize of their fray.He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.Dost love, Miriam?Dost
love thy man?—That may be too, Stephen said.There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr
Magee likes to quote.Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
will get it in middle life.Why does he send to one who is a
_buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a
scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?He was himself a lord
of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had
written _Romeo and Juliet_.Why?Belief in himself has been untimely
killed.

He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say)
and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play
victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.Assumed dongiovannism will
not save him.No later undoing will undo the first undoing.The tusk of
the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.If the shrew
is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon.There is,
I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new
passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own
understanding of himself.A like fate awaits him and the two rages
commingle in a whirlpool.They list.And in the porches of their ears I pour.—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
porch of a sleeping ear.But those who are done to death in sleep
cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their
souls with that knowledge in the life to come.The poisoning and the
beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know
of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.That is why the
speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere,
backward.Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with
him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare,
with its mole cinquespotted.He goes back, weary of the creation he has
piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.

perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising.I hear that an actress
played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.Vining held that the prince was a woman.Has no-one made him out to be
an Irishman?Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.He
swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,
lifting his brilliant notebook.That _Portrait of Mr W. H._ where he
proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all
hues.—For Willie Hughes, is it not?the quaker librarian asked.Or Hughie Wills?Mr William Himself.W. H.: who am I?—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.

bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare,
overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns
and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s
blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.And the gay
lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady
Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the
punks of the bankside, a penny a time.Cours la Reine._Encore vingt sous.Nous ferons de petites
cochonneries.Minette?Tu veux?_—The height of fine society.And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s
mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!—And Harry of six wives’ daughter.And other lady friends from
neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.But all those
twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing
behind the diamond panes?Do and do.Thing done.In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
he walks, greyedauburn.An azured harebell like her veins.Lids of
Juno’s eyes, violets.He walks.One life is all.One body.Do.But do.

Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.—Whom do you suspect?he challenged.—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.Once spurned twice
spurned.But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.Love that dare not speak its name.—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
lord.Old wall where sudden lizards flash.At Charenton I watched them.—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for
the stallion.Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he
had a shrew to wife.But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a
bedvow.Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the
dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s
brother.Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.Once a wooer,
twice a wooer.Stephen turned boldly in his chair.—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.If you
deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy
tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
between the day she married him and the day she buried him.

evil.He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,
with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_,
with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from
Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the
lustful queen.No.The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the
night.From hour to hour it rots and rots.He rests, disarmed of
fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with
child.Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to
man.It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only
begetter to only begotten.On that mystery and not on the madonna which
the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is
founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro
and microcosm, upon the void.Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood._Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true

annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,
hardly record its breach.Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,
lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with
grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls.The son
unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases
care.He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth
his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.—What links them in nature?An instant of blind rut.Am I a father?If I were?Shrunken uncertain hand.—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the
field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son.The bulldog of
Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him.Well: if the
father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a
father be a son?When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another
poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not
the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and
felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own
grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token,
never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors

Why did he take them rather than others?Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
(what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.Richard
the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.The
other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.Of all his
kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence,
the angel of the world.Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which
Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to
a Celtic legend older than history?—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended.We should not now combine
a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith._Que
voulez-vous?_ Moore would say.He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and
makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.—Why?Stephen answered himself.Because the theme of the false or the
usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.The note of
banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero
breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
book.It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.But it
was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
and left in him a strong inclination to evil.

The words are those of my
lords bishops of Maynooth.An original sin and, like original sin,
committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.It is between the
lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
which her four bones are not to be laid.Age has not withered it.Beauty and peace have not done it away.It is in infinite variety
everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_,
twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure
for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.Judge Eglinton summed up.—The truth is midway, he affirmed.He is the ghost and the prince.He
is all in all.—He is, Stephen said.The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.All in all.In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.He
acts and is acted on.Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he
kills the real Carmen.His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago
ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.—Cuckoo!Cuckoo!Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.O word of fear!Dark dome received, reverbed.—And what a character is Iago!undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.When
all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right.After God
Shakespeare has created most.—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.

of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:
_If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of
sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy
M.P.—Very well, indeed, father.And you, father?Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.

Belvedere?Was that so?Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear
that.And Mr Sheehy himself?Still in London.The house was still
sitting, to be sure it was.Beautiful weather it was, delightful
indeed.Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would
come again to preach.O, yes: a very great success.A wonderful man
really.Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.Yes, he would certainly call.—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.And smiled yet again,
in going.He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father
Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.—Pilate!Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?A zealous man, however.Really he was.And really did great good in his
way.Beyond a doubt.He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.Of good family too would one think it?Welsh, were they not?O, lest he forget.That letter to father provincial.Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
square.Yes: they were from Belvedere.The little house.Aha.And were
they good boys at school?O.That was very good now.And what was his
name?Jack Sohan.And his name?

Ger.Gallaher.And the other little
man?His name was Brunny Lynam.O, that was a very nice name to have.Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:—O, sir.—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter
to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.Father
Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
east.Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate
frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender
trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
farther footpath along which she sailed.And Father Conmee smiled and
saluted.How did she do?A fine carriage she had.Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.And to
think that she was a pawnbroker!Well, now!Such a... what should he

He felt it incumbent on
him to say a few words.But one should be charitable.Invincible
ignorance.They acted according to their lights.Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
road.It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an
important thoroughfare.Surely, there ought to be.A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.All
raised untidy caps.Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.Christian brother boys.Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.Saint
Joseph’s church, Portland row.For aged and virtuous females.Father
Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.Virtuous: but
occasionally they were also badtempered.Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
nobleman.And now it was an office or something.Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.Father
Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.He passed Grogan’s the
Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
catastrophe in New York.In America those things were continually
happening.Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.Still, an
act of perfect contrition.Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of
which two unlabouring men lounged.They saluted him and were saluted.Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny
Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.

A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
the constable.In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee
observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
tubes.Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
him.It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out
and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
people.On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis
Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
tram.Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of
saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a
sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into
his purse.Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket
inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away
the ticket.

The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father
Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.Father Conmee liked
cheerful decorum.It was a peaceful day.The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.His wife, Father Conmee
supposed.A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman
with the glasses.She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so
gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and
smiled tinily, sweetly.Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.He perceived also that
the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
seat.Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.The conductor pulled the
bellstrap to stay the car for her.She passed out with her basket and a
marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been
absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many
cares, poor creatures.From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
Father Conmee.

Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men
and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission
and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and
brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when
their last hour came like a thief in the night.That book by the
Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a
reasonable plea.Those were millions of human souls created by God in
His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.)been brought.But
they were God’s souls, created by God.It seemed to Father Conmee a
pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
conductor and saluted in his turn.The Malahide road was quiet.It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.Lord Talbot de Malahide,
immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old
times in the barony.Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the
Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and
of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of
Belvedere.A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
not startled when an otter plunged.Who could know the truth?

Not the
jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with
her husband’s brother?She would half confess if she had not all sinned
as women did.Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however
for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our
ways.Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.He was humane and
honoured there.He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
clusters.And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
were impalmed by Don John Conmee.It was a charming day.The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
curtseying to him with ample underleaves.The sky showed him a flock of
small white clouds going slowly down the wind._Moutonner,_ the French
said.A just and homely word.Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
over Rathcoffey.His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
Clongowes field.He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the
cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
evening.He was their rector: his reign was mild.Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.An ivory bookmark told him the page.Nones.He should have read that before lunch.

But lady Maxwell had
come.Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast._Deus in adiutorium._He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas:
in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.The young man raised
his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
breviary._Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
formidavit cor meum._*    *    *
Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping
eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.He pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings.Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway.There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting
Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.Towards
Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:—_For England_...He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
and growled:—_home and beauty._J. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in
the warehouse with a visitor.A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
into the cap held out to her.The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced
sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself
forward four strides.He halted and growled angrily:—_For England_...Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
towards a window and bayed deeply:—_home and beauty._The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.The blind of the window was drawn aside.A card _Unfurnished
Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell.

A plump bare generous arm
shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut

tickled by stubble.—Where did you try?Boody asked.—M’Guinness’s.Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.—Bad cess to her big face!she cried.Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.—What’s in the pot?she asked.—Shirts, Maggy said.Boody cried angrily:—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:—And what’s in this?A heavy fume gushed in answer.—Peasoup, Maggy said.—Where did you get it?Katey asked.—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.The lacquey rang his bell.—Barang!Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:—Give us it here.

slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:—Woa, sonny!He turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked:—Well, Jack.What is it?What’s the trouble?Wait awhile.Hold hard.With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an

O’Neill’s clock.—After three, he said.Who’s riding her?—O.Madden, Lenehan said.And a game filly she is.While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle

bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.There were
fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
comets with long tails.Astronomy it was about.Lenehan laughed.—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said.Come over

carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
eagerly.The annual dinner, you know.Boiled shirt affair.The lord

curacoa to which we did ample justice.Fast and furious it was.After
liquids came solids.Cold joints galore and mince pies...—I know, M’Coy said.The year the missus was there...Lenehan linked his arm warmly.—But wait till I tell you, he said.We had a midnight lunch too after
all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the
morning after the night before.Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s
night on the Featherbed Mountain.Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.We started
singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.She was well
primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband.Every
jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.Hell’s
delights!She has a fine pair, God bless her.Like that.He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.Know what I mean?His hands moulded ample curves of air.He shut his eyes tight in
delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.She’s a gamey
mare and no mistake.

Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the
comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear
and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.But, by God, I
was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.He knows them all, faith.At
last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away._And what star is that,
Poldy?_ says she.By God, she had Bloom cornered._That one, is it?_
says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._
By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft
laughter.—I’m weak, he gasped.M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.Lenehan
walked on again.He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
rapidly.He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.He’s not one
of your common or garden... you know... There’s a touch of the artist

waiting for Ben Dollard.He’s going to say a word to long John to get
him to take those two men off.All I want is a little time.He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
his neck.—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.Poor old bockedy Ben!He’s always
doing a good turn for someone.Hold hard!He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.

Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.He came towards
them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
Dollard’s figure.Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he
muttered sneeringly:—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.Thanks be to
God he’s not paid yet.—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?Father Cowley asked.Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth
a deep note.—Aw!he said.—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.—What about that?Ben Dollard said.Not too dusty?What?He turned to both.—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.

The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by
Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
hurdles.Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
his joyful fingers in the air.—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.I want to show
you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.He’s a cross between
Lobengula and Lynchehaun.He’s well worth seeing, mind you.Come along.I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will
cost me a fall if I don’t...Wait awhile... We’re on the right lay,
Bob, believe you me.—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.—What few days?he boomed.Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?—He has, Father Cowley said.—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben
Dollard said.The landlord has the prior claim.I gave him all the
particulars.29 Windsor avenue.Love is the name?—That’s right, Father Cowley said.The reverend Mr Love.He’s a
minister in the country somewhere.But are you sure of that?

—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they
passed out of the Castleyard gate.The policeman touched his forehead.—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
towards Lord Edward street.Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared
above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.I wrote to Father
Conmee and laid the whole case before him.—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.—Boyd?Martin Cunningham said shortly.Touch me not.John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
quickly down Cork hill.On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_
office.I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.And put down the
five shillings too.—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.

They went down Parliament street.—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.Here goes.Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John
Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms.The
empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.Martin Cunningham,
speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
glance.—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
life.The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
greeted.Long John Fanning made no way for them.He removed his large Henry Clay
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
their faces.—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
about their damned Irish language.Where was the marshal, he wanted to
know, to keep order in the council chamber.

no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.Damned Irish language,

the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held
his peace.—What Dignam was that?long John Fanning asked.Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.—O, my corns!he said plaintively.Come upstairs for goodness’ sake
till I sit down somewhere.Uff!Ooo!Mind!Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
passed in and up the stairs.—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.I don’t think
you knew him or perhaps you did, though.With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.—Rather lowsized.Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham
said.Long John Fanning could not remember him.Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.—What’s that?Martin Cunningham said.All turned where they stood.John Wyse Nolan came down again.From the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.Gaily they went
past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.

In saddles of the
leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.—What was it?Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the
staircase.—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
Nolan answered from the stairfoot.*    *    *
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
Panama to Haines:—Parnell’s brother.There in the corner.They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man
whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.—Is that he?Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.—Yes, Mulligan said.That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.An instant after,
under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and
fell once more upon a working corner.—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said.And bring us some scones and
butter and some cakes as well.When she had gone he said, laughing:—We call it D.B.C.because they have damn bad cakes.O, but you missed
Dedalus on _Hamlet._Haines opened his newbought book.—I’m sorry, he said.Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all
minds that have lost their balance.The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:—_England expects_...Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.

thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.Now I am speculating what it
would be likely to be.Such persons always have.Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.He will never
capture the Attic note.The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
death and the ruddy birth.That is his tragedy.He can never be a poet.The joy of creation...—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.I see.I tackled him
this morning on belief.There was something on his mind, I saw.It’s
rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
interesting point out of that.Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.He helped her to
unload her tray.—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
the cheerful cups.The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
of retribution.Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.Does he write anything for your movement?He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over
its smoking pith.He bit off a soft piece hungrily.—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.He is going to write
something in ten years.—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.

He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.I don’t
want to be imposed on.Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping

a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr
Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name
announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
duke’s lawn.His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.With ratsteeth
bared he muttered:—_Coactus volui._He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat

having buffeted a thewless body.The blind stripling turned his sickly

Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been
sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.It was too blooming
dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
blooming time and sighing.After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
stopped him.He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
pelts and putting up their props.From the sidemirrors two mourning
Masters Dignam gaped silently.Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will
meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of
fifty sovereigns.Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see.Myler
Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.Two bar
entrance, soldiers half price.I could easy do a bunk on ma.Master
Dignam on his left turned as he turned.That’s me in mourning.When is
it?May the twentysecond.Sure, the blooming thing is all over.

He
turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap
awry, his collar sticking up.Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he
saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two
puckers.One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer
smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found
out.Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.The best pucker going
for strength was Fitzsimons.One puck in the wind from that fellow
would knock you into the middle of next week, man.But the best pucker
for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out
of him, dodging and all.In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and
a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
telling him and grinning all the time.No Sandymount tram.Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his
other hand.His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.The
blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
end to it.He met schoolboys with satchels.I’m not going tomorrow
either, stay away till Monday.He met other schoolboys.Do they notice
I’m in mourning?Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s
name.His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a
fly walking over it up to his eye.

obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern

metropolis.At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted
him vainly from afar.

Between Queen’s and Whitworth bridges lord
Dudley’s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley
White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White’s,
the pawnbroker’s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose
with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough
more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot
through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus.In the

her plan and retracing her steps by King’s windows smiled credulously

up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she
couldn’t see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring’s
big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its
being the lord lieutenant.Beyond Lundy Foot’s from the shaded door of
Kavanagh’s winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness
towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland.The
Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed
Micky Anderson’s all times ticking watches and Henry and James’s wax

her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon
lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald
Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and
Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders
of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon
John Howard Parnell looked intently.In Fownes’s street Dilly Dedalus,
straining her sight upward from Chardenal’s first French primer, saw
sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare.John Henry
Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from
winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in
his fat left hand not feeling it.Where the foreleg of King Billy’s
horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from

courthouse talking of one thing or another.Decent fellow Joe when he
has it but sure like that he never has it.Jesus, I couldn’t get over
that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.For trading without a
licence, says he.In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.There
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.There sleep the mighty dead as
in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.A pleasant
land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport
the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,
the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed
coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too
numerous to be enumerated.

In the mild breezes of the west and of the
east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass
foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal
world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing
the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects
as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts
of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful
insects.And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to
Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht
the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of
Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the
sons of kings.And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
descended from chieftains.

bloody dog.I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off
a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
about a licence.—Stand and deliver, says he.—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe.Friends here.—Pass, friends, says he.Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:—What’s your opinion of the times?Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.But, begob, Joe was equal to
the occasion.—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
fork.So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:—Foreign wars is the cause of it.And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I’ve a thirst on me
I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.—Wine of the country, says he.—What’s yours?says Joe.—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.—Three pints, Terry, says Joe.And how’s the old heart, citizen?says

and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.

that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
hero.From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.The eyes in
which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.A powerful current of warm
breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his
mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations
of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the
summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to
vibrate and tremble.He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to
the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a
girdle of plaited straw and rushes.Beneath this he wore trews of
deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.His nether extremities were
encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet
being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast.

the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge

effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the
orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar
plexus.

Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the
heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return
but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty
entities on the lower astral levels.In reply to a question as to his
first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously
he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had
summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the
flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the
spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort
such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest
adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently
afforded relief.Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted
all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true
path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were
out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.It was

The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly
dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo
mortis per diminutionem capitis._So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard
and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe
with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported
for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this,
that and the other.Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a
new dog so he ought.Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all
round the place and scratching his scabs.And round he goes to Bob
Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could
get.So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:—Give us the paw!Give the paw, doggy!Good old doggy!Give the paw
here!Give us the paw!

Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from
tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.Then he starts scraping a few
bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to
bring.Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
out of him a yard long for more.Near ate the tin and all, hungry
bloody mongrel.And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
she’s far from the land.And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.Phenomenon!The fat heap he
married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me
there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and
Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing
bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating
meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and
taking the lout out for a walk.

And one time he led him the rounds of
Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought
him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him
the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near
roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd
that kept the hotel.Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them
off chewing the fat.And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but
on the other hand_.And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in
Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless
in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the
samples in the bloody establishment.Phenomenon!—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
glaring at Bloom.—Ay, ay, says Joe.—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.What I mean is...—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen._Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love
are by our side and the foes we hate before us.The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.From the belfries far
and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.The deafening
claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the
ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.

A torrential rain
poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared
heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest
computation five hundred thousand persons.A posse of Dublin
Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.Special quick excursion trains
and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
country cousins of whom there were large contingents.Considerable
amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual
mirth-provoking fashion.Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will
grudge them their hardearned pennies.The children of the Male and
Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the
scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s
entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the
Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and
motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.The viceregal
houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their
Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while
the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald
Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.

delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest
possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which
they had been called upon to witness.An animated altercation (in which
all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as to whether the eighth
or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s
patron saint.

In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,
boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas,
catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to
and blows were freely exchanged.The baby policeman, Constable
MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly
restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth
of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending
parties.The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to
all and was unanimously accepted.Constable MacFadden was heartily
congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of whom were bleeding
profusely.Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from
underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal
adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his
thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the
pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their
senses.The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and
gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their
rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus
Cruentus_.He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough
which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking

The arrival of the
worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the
huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in
their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates
cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio,
chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing
_evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling
those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani
beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.It
was exactly seventeen o’clock.The signal for prayer was then promptly
given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the
commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession
of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his
medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.The learned prelate who
administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a
pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to
the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.Hard by the block
stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in
a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which
his eyes glowered furiously.As he awaited the fatal signal he tested
the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or
decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been
provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.

On a
handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering
knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially
supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and
Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the
duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully
extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most
precious blood of the most precious victim.The housesteward of the
amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these
vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.Quite an
excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and
onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and
invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for
the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital
spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the
proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in
these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying
wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in
aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’
association as a token of his regard and esteem.The _nec_ and _non
plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst
her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself
upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into
eternity for her sake.The hero folded her willowy form in a loving
embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.

Encouraged by this use of
her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable
areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her
ardour to reach.She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of
their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would
never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips
as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.She
brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood
together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the
innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present,
they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable
pastor, joining in the general merriment.That monster audience simply
rocked with delight.But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped
their hands for the last time.A fresh torrent of tears burst from
their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the
inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being
the aged prebendary himself.Big strong men, officers of the peace and
genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of
their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye
in that record assemblage.A most romantic incident occurred when a
handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair
sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and
genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady,
requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.

Every
lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the
occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and
generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the
gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most
timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his
blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in
the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.Nay,
even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell
ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had
blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without
flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.With his mailed
gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those
privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to
murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.Blimey it
makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak
their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he
cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.Antitreating is
about the size of it.

Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down
his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth
of his pint.And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and
oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
entertainment, don’t be talking.Ireland sober is Ireland free.And
then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.And one or two
sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
females, hitting below the belt.So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
starts mousing around by Joe and me.I’d train him by kindness, so I
would, if he was my dog.Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
where it wouldn’t blind him.—Afraid he’ll bite you?says the citizen, jeering.—No, says I.But he might take my leg for a lamppost.So he calls the old dog over.—What’s on you, Garry?says he.Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.

Someone
that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono
publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of
that.Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth
is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_
of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends
and acquaintances Owen Garry.The exhibition, which is the result of
years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary
system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from
us!)has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and
compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_
resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic
bards.We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with
which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym
of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but
rather (as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting
communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and
more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the
famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more
modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.

whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we
believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more
than an indication.The metrical system of the canine original, which
recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh
englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will
agree that the spirit has been well caught.Perhaps it should be added
that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat

Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor
Dignam’s.Martin asked me to go to the house.You see, he, Dignam, I
mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the
time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the
policy.—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is
landed.So the wife comes out top dog, what?—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.—Whose admirers?says Joe.—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled
with his mortgagor under the act.He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in
himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a

to tell her that.Shake hands, brother.You’re a rogue and I’m another.—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is
founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to
request of you this favour.But, should I have overstepped the limits
of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my
boldness.—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me
consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness
of the cup.—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.The goodness of your heart,
I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the
expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
speech.And off with him and out trying to walk straight.Boosed at five

honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that
these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is
forthcoming as to their pathological condition?Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.Con.): Honourable members are already in
possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
house.I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.The answer to the
honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
Phoenix park?Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.

he is sitting there.The man that got away James Stephens.The champion
of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.What was your best

time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.—Put it there, citizen, says Joe.You were and a bloody sight better.—Is that really a fact?says Alf.—Yes, says Bloom.That’s well known.Did you not know that?So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
and building up a nation once again and all to that.And of course
Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart
violent exercise was bad.I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a
straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.Do you see that straw?That’s a straw_.Declare to my aunt he’d talk
about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian
O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of
_Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.The
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions.After an instructive discourse by
the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high
standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the
revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic
forefathers.The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised
morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient
ages.L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses,
having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without
fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.

The final bout of fireworks
was a gruelling for both champions.The welterweight sergeantmajor had
tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had
been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in
some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.The
soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which
the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the
point of Bennett’s jaw.The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him
with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.The men came to
handigrips.Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout
ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.The
Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he
was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey
and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in
jigtime.It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.The two
fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.The referee twice
cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his
footwork a treat to watch.After a brisk exchange of courtesies during
which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from
his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and
landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him
flat.It was a knockout clean and clever.

Amid tense expectation the
Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole
Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared
victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the
ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.I hear he’s
running a concert tour now up in the north.—He is, says Joe.Isn’t he?—Who?says Bloom.Ah, yes.That’s quite true.Yes, a kind of summer
tour, you see.Just a holiday.—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she?says Joe.—My wife?says Bloom.She’s singing, yes.I think it will be a success
too.He’s an excellent man to organise.Excellent.Hoho begob says I to myself says I.That explains the milk in the
cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest.Blazes doing the

broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe,
the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn
bronze.The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce
Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same
tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a
pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form
of heron feathers of paletinted coral.

_Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.On leaving
the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the
happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts,
beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries,
mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan
will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.We had our trade with
Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.—And will again, says Joe.—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
citizen, clapping his thigh.Our harbours that are empty will be full
again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a
fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the
O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.

And will again, says he, when
the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own
flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag
afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns
on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.And he took the last swig out of the pint.Moya.All wind and piss like
a tanyard cat.Cows in Connacht have long horns.As much as his bloody

multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly
Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
holding of an evicted tenant.—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.What will you have?—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.Terry!Are you
asleep?—Yes, sir, says Terry.Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.Right, sir.Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead
of attending to the general public.Picture of a butting match, trying
to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his
head down like a bull at a gate.And another one: _Black Beast Burned
in Omaha, Ga_.A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing

—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at
bay?—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.Hell upon earth it is.Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on
the training ships at Portsmouth.A fellow writes that calls himself
_Disgusted One_.So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of
tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend
of a gun.—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on
the breech.And says John Wyse:—’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
till he yells meila murder.—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
earth.The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary
chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a
dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.That’s the great empire they
boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.The
unfortunate yahoos believe it.

They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was
scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day
he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend
till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be
paid.—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere.I mean wouldn’t
it be the same here if you put force against force?Didn’t I tell you?As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his
last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.We have our greater
Ireland beyond the sea.They were driven out of house and home in the
black 47.Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the
whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
redskins in America.Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.But the
Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of
crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.Ay,
they drove out the peasants in hordes.Twenty thousand of them died in
the coffinships.But those that came to the land of the free remember
the land of bondage.And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.

poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
Killala.—Ay, says John Wyse.We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
against the Williamites and they betrayed us.Remember Limerick and the
broken treatystone.We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
wild geese.Fontenoy, eh?And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan
in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
Teresa.But what did we ever get for it?—The French!says the citizen.Set of dancing masters!Do you know what
it is?They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.Aren’t they
trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with
perfidious Albion?Firebrands of Europe and they always were.—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we
had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George
the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s
dead?

Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old
one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every
night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman
carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by
the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the
Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.—Well, says J. J.We have Edward the peacemaker now.—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.There’s a bloody sight more pox
than pax about that boyo.Edward Guelph-Wettin!—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and
bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
jockeys rode.The earl of Dublin, no less.—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
Alf.And says J. J.:—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.—Will you try another, citizen?says Joe.—Yes, sir, says he.I will.—You?says Joe.—Beholden to you, Joe, says I.May your shadow never grow less.—Repeat that dose, says Joe.Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling
about.—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.Perpetuating national hatred among nations.—But do you know what a nation means?says John Wyse.—Yes, says Bloom.—What is it?

muck out of it:—Or also living in different places.—That covers my case, says Joe.—What is your nation if I may ask?says the citizen.—Ireland, says Bloom.I was born here.Ireland.The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
swab himself dry.—Here you are, citizen, says Joe.Take that in your right hand and
repeat after me the following words.The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh,
authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and
called forth prolonged admiration.No need to dwell on the legendary
beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly
discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the
four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American
puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said
in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.

The

raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive

illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of
England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief
woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the
august hand of the Royal Donor.The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of
firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of
his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty
Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and
signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a
charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed
several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.—Widow woman, says Ned.I wouldn’t doubt her.Wonder did he put that
bible to the same use as I would.—Same only more so, says Lenehan.And thereafter in that fruitful land
the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.—Is that by Griffith?says John Wyse.—No, says the citizen.

characterised by the most affecting cordiality.An illuminated scroll
of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to

community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket,
tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work
which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of
those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of
Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_,
followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_.Tarbarrels and bonfires
were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the
Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains
of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the
Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of
M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.Amid
cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a
big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills,
the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final
floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were
present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river,
escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and
Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical
power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.

_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom!Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not

way and off with him.—Hold on, citizen, says Joe.Stop!Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.Mercy of God the
sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead.Gob, he near sent
it into the county Longford.The bloody nag took fright and the old
mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting
and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.The
observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the
fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a
similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534,

enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying

The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
embrace.Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the
stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a
beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.

Many a time and
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits
with caps to match and the name _H.M. S. Belleisle_ printed on both.For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very
noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little
fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.They
were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building
castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy
as the day was long.And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to
and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with
delight.He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a
tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.Cissy
Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty
dimple in his chin.—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.Say out big, big.I want a drink of
water.And baby prattled after her:—A jink a jink a jawbo.Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of
children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could
never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that
held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown
bread with golden syrup on.What a persuasive power that girl had!

But
to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in
his new fancy bib.None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort,
was Cissy Caffrey.A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life,
always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her
cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.And Edy Boardman
laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
Master Jacky.Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to
this golden rule.The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like
the Martello tower had.But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky
was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s
house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose
that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!)the
coveted castle too.Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master
Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.At once!And you,
Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.Wait till I
catch you for that.His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for
their big sister’s word was law with the twins.And in a sad plight he
was too after his misadventure.

His little man-o’-war top and
unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the
art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one
speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.Still the blue
eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed
away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and
said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing
in admonition.—Nasty bold Jacky!she cried.She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:—What’s your name?Butter and cream?—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.Is Cissy your
sweetheart?—Nao, tearful Tommy said.—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?Cissy queried.—Nao, Tommy said.—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from
her shortsighted eyes.I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart.Gerty is
Tommy’s sweetheart.—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy
Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.But who was Gerty?Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a
specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.

She was
pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said,
she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.Her figure was slight and
graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had
been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the
Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges
she used to get and that tired feeling.The waxen pallor of her face
was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth
was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect.Her hands were of finely
veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and
queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used
to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.Bertha Supple
told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black
out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their
little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told
her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or
she’d never speak to her again.No.Honour where honour is due.There
was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which
was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.

Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in
her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education
Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the
land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow
and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their
devoirs to her.Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that
lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed
meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful
eyes, a charm few could resist.Why have women such eyes of witchery?Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and
dark expressive brows.Time was when those brows were not so silkily
seductive.It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful
page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try
eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so
becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.Then
there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase
your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?That would
suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.But Gerty’s crowning
glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.It was dark brown with a
natural wave in it.She had cut it that very morning on account of the
new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of
luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.

And
just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest
rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet
girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not
hold her equal.For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.She was
about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out
into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young
May morning.She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
lovers’ quarrel.As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about
the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding
up and down in front of her window.Only now his father kept him in in
the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate
that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a
doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who
was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.Little
recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart
sometimes, piercing to the core.Yet he was young and perchance he
might learn to love her in time.They were protestants in his family
and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed
Virgin and then Saint Joseph.

But he was undeniably handsome with an
exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the
shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would
know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the

perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size
too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so
frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front
of her bit of a garden.Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
out.A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because
it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be
worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket
(in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful
figure to perfection.She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of
wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue
chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.All Tuesday
week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she
found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly
shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on
then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to
her!

And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew
that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.Her shoes
were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she
was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a
five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one
smart buckle over her higharched instep.Her wellturned ankle displayed
its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount
and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with
highspliced heels and wide garter tops.As for undies they were Gerty’s
chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet
seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in
his heart to blame her?She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty
stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with
different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen,
and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the
wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because
she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching
the things.

She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her
own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on
her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his
father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and
because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was
dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside
out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things
on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so
long as it wasn’t of a Friday.And yet and yet!That strained look on her face!A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time.Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror.You are lovely, Gerty, it said.The paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage
has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.
C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs
Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was
wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox
was not to be.He was too young to understand.He would not believe in
love, a woman’s birthright.

The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s
(he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an
arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.He called her
little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the
first!)but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from
the room with a remark about refreshments.Impetuous fellow!Strength
of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would
woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.But waiting,
always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be
over.No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous
love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who
had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey,
and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her
to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort
her with a long long kiss.It would be like heaven.For such a one she
yearns this balmy summer eve.With all the heart of her she longs to be
his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in
health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be.Then they could talk about her till they went blue
in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she
would be twentytwo in November.

She would care for him with creature
comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked
that feeling of hominess.Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue
and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden
opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a
fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same
direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of
eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people
that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something
poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully
appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph
of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was
so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in
Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.He would be
tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a
husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed
sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their
honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!)and then, when they settled down in
a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both
have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and
before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a
good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then
she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run
off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.

said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with

it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please.The temper of him!O, he was a man already was little Tommy
Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.Edy told him no, no and to be off
now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.It’s my ball.But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand
and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played
here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread
carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper

like that from everyone always petting him.—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t
say.—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.But not a pin cared
Ciss.

—Let him!she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose.Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at
him.Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.You had to laugh at her sometimes.For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea
and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on
her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to
go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the
Miss White.That was just like Cissycums.O, and will you ever forget
her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the
burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a
cigarette.There was none to come up to her for fun.But she was
sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever
made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the
pealing anthem of the organ.It was the men’s temperance retreat
conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary,
sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.They were there
gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most
edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves,
after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the
immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her
to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin
of virgins.

How sad to poor Gerty’s ears!Had her father only avoided
the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders
the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in
her carriage, second to none.Over and over had she told herself that
as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp
because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window
dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had
cast its shadow over her childhood days.Nay, she had even witnessed in
the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen
her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself
completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it
was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of
kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
Virgin most merciful.And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.You never saw him
any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
father because he was too old or something or on account of his face
(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.Poor
father!

With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me,
Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they
had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper
and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died
suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.Her
mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom
and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have
had a group taken.No-one would have thought the end was so near.Now
he was laid to rest.And her mother said to him to let that be a
warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the
funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him
the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,
artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and
always bright and cheery in the home.A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
gold.And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t
like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.Everyone thought the
world of her for her gentle ways.

Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.You could see there was a
story behind it.The colours were done something lovely.She was in a
soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.She often looked at them
dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and
thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s
pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
halcyon days what they meant.The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till
at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no
getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
could down towards the seaweedy rocks.Needless to say poor Tommy was
not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
the ball.Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries
and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it
to her please.The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then
threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the
slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the
rock.

The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it
away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she
wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a
kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.A delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball
a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it
down towards the shingle.Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else
to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.She
felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell,
surging and flaming into her cheeks.Till then they had only exchanged
glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she
ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the
twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had
ever seen.Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain
of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.

And
careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary,
the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in
any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever
abandoned by her.The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.Cissy Caffrey played with
baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was
Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah!and, my
word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that!And then she told him to say
papa.—Say papa, baby.Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
to be something great, they said.—Haja ja ja haja.Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
blanket the other way under him.Of course his infant majesty was most
obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.

It was all
no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen
was quickly appeased.Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
brats of twins.She gazed out towards the distant sea.It was like the
paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out,
the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and
to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they
burned in the church like a kind of waft.And while she gazed her heart
went pitapat.Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning
in his look.His eyes burned into her as though they would search her
through and through, read her very soul.Wonderful eyes they were,
superbly expressive, but could you trust them?People were so queer.She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face
that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin
Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred
because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they
two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see
whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he
was sitting.He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story
of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.

She would have given
worlds to know what it was.He was looking up so intently, so still,
and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel
buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the
toes down.She was glad that something told her to put on the
transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was
far away.Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.It was he
who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him
because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.The very
heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she
knew on the instant it was him.If he had suffered, more sinned against
than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked
man, she cared not.Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could
convert him easily if he truly loved her.There were wounds that wanted
healing with heartbalm.She was a womanly woman not like other flighty
girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they
hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she
could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the
past.Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man,
crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for
herself alone.Refuge of sinners.Comfortress of the afflicted._Ora pro nobis_.

Well
has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy
can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge
for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her
own heart.Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the
stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue
banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping
Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes
cast down.He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet
and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever
she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come
to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.He told her that time
when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots
of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was
only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he
said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the
nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady
herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to
Thy Word.

thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design
for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the
mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little
house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the
forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a
present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or
some place.The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.Little
monkeys common as ditchwater.Someone ought to take them and give them
a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
them.And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.—Jacky!Tommy!Not they!What a great notion they had!So Cissy said it was the very
last time she’d ever bring them out.She jumped up and called them and
she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow
long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat
at it.

She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip
up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a
lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece
whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just
because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see
all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as
possible.It would have served her just right if she had tripped up
over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French
heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble._Tableau!_
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that
to witness.Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy
handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and
censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and
she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she
didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a
bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking
that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed
the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the
Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she
just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to
the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.

many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.She

could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster

eying her as a snake eyes its prey.Her woman’s instinct told her that
she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet
swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a
glorious rose.Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
baby.

Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was
why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no
concern of hers.And she said to Gerty:—A penny for your thoughts.—What?replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.I
was only wondering was it late.Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and
their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
gave a gentle hint about its being late.And when Cissy came up Edy
asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was
half past kissing time, time to kiss again.But Edy wanted to know
because they were told to be in early.—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the
time by his conundrum.So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
watchchain, looking up at the church.Passionate nature though he was
Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself.One moment
he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and
the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol
expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to
it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry
his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
sun was set.

Merging and summarizing: 
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
his waterworks were out of order.Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon
got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he
told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire
to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and
she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the
works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.It was getting
darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was
winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it
back and put his hands back into his pockets.She felt a kind of a
sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp
and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on
because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of
the moon.His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her
every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.If ever there was
undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to
be seen on that man’s face.It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you
know it.

Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon
stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed
him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti
eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and
asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just
answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she
heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.Gerty winced sharply.A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn
immeasurable.It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet
way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded
little cat she was.Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but
she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless,
so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.She had loved him better than he knew.Lighthearted deceiver and fickle
like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and
for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she
sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them
to see.—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
flashed up.

I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.There was that in her young
voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.As
for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a
dozen pieces.And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him
one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty
could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a
towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft
had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked
in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because
the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.And Cissy told
him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and
baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and
Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby,
without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and
sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.

—O my!Puddeny pie!protested Ciss.He has his bib destroyed.The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set
that little matter to rights.Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
Blessed Sacrament in his hands.How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time
a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
thither, with a tiny lost cry.And she could see far away the lights of
the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the
lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church
grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked
and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn
his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss
Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.For Gerty had her
dreams that no-one knew of.

She loved to read poetry and when she got a
keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the
coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of
her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was
scrupulously neat and clean.It was there she kept her girlish treasure
trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose
scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to
change when her things came home from the wash and there were some
beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in
Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if
she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so
deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening
round the potherbs._Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J
Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt
thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient
loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the
years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one
shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an
accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.But it must end, she felt.If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there
would be no holding back for her.Love laughs at locksmiths.She would
make the great sacrifice.Her every effort would be to share his
thoughts.Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his
days with happiness.

There was the allimportant question and she was
dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife
or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land
of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.But
even if—what then?Would it make a very great difference?From
everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively
recoiled.She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the
accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and
coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and
being taken up to the police station.No, no: not that.They would be
just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other
in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.Perhaps it was
an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.She
thought she understood.She would try to understand him because men
were so different.The old love was waiting, waiting with little white
hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.Heart of mine!She would
follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he
was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was
the master guide.Nothing else mattered.Come what might she would be
wild, untrammelled, free.Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then
he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and
Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked

—O, look, Cissy!And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over
the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.It’s the bazaar fireworks.But Gerty was adamant.She had no intention of being at their beck and
call.If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she
could see from where she was.The eyes that were fastened upon her set
her pulses tingling.She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance,
and a light broke in upon her.Whitehot passion was in that face,
passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.At last they were
left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he
could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of
inflexible honour to his fingertips.His hands and face were working
and a tremour went over her.

She leaned back far to look up where the
fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall
back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she
revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply
soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his
heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of
men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead
secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that
was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had
pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and
she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine
sometimes in the bed.But this was altogether different from a thing
like that because there was all the difference because she could almost
feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his
handsome lips.Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do
the other thing before being married and there ought to be women
priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy
Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes
so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’
photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on
the way it did.And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned
back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent
and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was
and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something
queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.

she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in
the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went
higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up
after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused
with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see
her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the
skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven,
on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and
then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was
trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full
view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or
wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that
immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the
wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so
immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.She
would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms
to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a
young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry
that has rung through the ages.And then a rocket sprang and bang shot
blind blank and O!then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh
of O!and everyone cried O!O!in raptures and it gushed out of it a
stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah!

they were all
greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet,
soft!Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.Ah!She
glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.He was leaning back against the rock behind.Leopold Bloom (for it is
he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.What a brute he had been!At it again?A fair unsullied soul had called
to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?An utter cad he
had been!He of all men!But there was an infinite store of mercy in
those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and
sinned and wandered.Should a girl tell?No, a thousand times no.That
was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there
was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly
through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to
show what a great person she was: and then she cried:—Gerty!Gerty!We’re going.Come on.We can see from farther up.Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.She slipped a hand into
her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
course without letting him and then slipped it back.Wonder if he’s too
far to.She rose.Was it goodbye?No.She had to go but they would meet
again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
dream of yester eve.

souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her
heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet

a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,

Pretend to want something
awfully, then cry off for her sake.Flatters them.She must have been
thinking of someone else all the time.What harm?Must since she came
to the use of reason, he, he and he.First kiss does the trick.The
propitious moment.Something inside them goes pop.Mushy like, tell by
their eye, on the sly.First thoughts are best.Remember that till
their dying day.Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
Moorish wall beside the gardens.Fifteen she told me.But her breasts
were developed.Fell asleep then.After Glencree dinner that was when
we drove home.Featherbed mountain.Gnashing her teeth in sleep.Lord
mayor had his eye on her too.Val Dillon.Apoplectic.There she is with them down there for the fireworks.My fireworks.Up
like a rocket, down like a stick.And the children, twins they must be,
waiting for something to happen.Want to be grownups.Dressing in
mother’s clothes.Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.I knew she
could whistle.Mouth made for that.Like Molly.Why that highclass
whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose.Would you mind,
please, telling me the right time?I’ll tell you the right time up a
dark lane.Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for
fat lips.Caressing the little boy too.Onlookers see most of the game.Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.In their line.Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand.Wouldn’t give that
satisfaction.

Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.Fine eyes she had, clear.It’s the white of the eye brings that out not
so much the pupil.Did she know what I?Course.Like a cat sitting
beyond a dog’s jump.Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high
school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.Call
that innocence?Poor idiot!His wife has her work cut out for her.Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.Eyes all over them.Look under the bed for what’s not there.Longing to get the fright of
their lives.Sharp as needles they are.When I said to Molly the man at
the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like,
twigged at once he had a false arm.Had, too.Where do they get that?Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her
understandings.Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.Bred in the bone.Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the
mirror to save the ironing.Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye
on a mirror.And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to
Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her
stocking!Clever little minx.I never told her.Neat way she carries
parcels too.Attract men, small thing like that.Holding up her hand,
shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.Who did you
learn that from?Nobody.Something the nurse taught me.O, don’t they
know!

Grafton street.White.Wow!Beef to the heel.A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.Zrads
and zrads, zrads, zrads.And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see
and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the
rocks.Will she?Watch!Watch!See!Looked round.She smelt an onion.Darling, I saw, your.I saw all.Lord!Did me good all the same.Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s.For
this relief much thanks.In _Hamlet,_ that is.Lord!It was all things
combined.Excitement.When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of
my tongue.Your head it simply swirls.He’s right.Might have made a
worse fool of myself however.Instead of talking about nothing.Then I
will tell you all.Still it was a kind of language between us.It
couldn’t be?No, Gerty they called her.Might be false name however
like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.

     Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
     And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.Place made me think of that I suppose.All tarred with the same brush.Wiping pens in their stockings.But the ball rolled down to her as if
it understood.Every bullet has its billet.Course I never could throw
anything straight at school.Crooked as a ram’s horn.Sad however
because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping
and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby
when they hold him out to do ah ah.No soft job.Saves them.Keeps them
out of harm’s way.Nature.Washing child, washing corpse.Dignam.Children’s hands always round them.Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.Fill it up
with wind.Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.Must call to the hospital.Wonder is
nurse Callan there still.She used to look over some nights when Molly
was in the Coffee Palace.That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her
brushing his coat.And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too,
marriageable.Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City
Arms.Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.Then ask in
the morning: was I drunk last night?Bad policy however to fault the
husband.Chickens come home to roost.They stick by one another like
glue.

introduce my.Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript,

didn’t take them in hand.Then little chits of girls, height of a

influence between the person because that was about the time he.Yes, I
suppose, at once.Cat’s away, the mice will play.I remember looking in
Pill lane.Also that now is magnetism.Back of everything magnetism.Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.That causes movement.And time, well that’s the time the movement takes.Then if one thing

the horse show.And when the painters were in Lombard street west.Fine
voice that fellow had.How Giuglini began.Smell that I did.Like
flowers.It was too.Violets.Came from the turpentine probably in the
paint.Make their own use of everything.Same time doing it scraped her
slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear.But lots of them can’t kick

horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a

was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.But
the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have

marvellous castle.And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for
to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches
environing in divers lands and sometime venery.And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
move more for enchantment.And on this board were frightful swords and
knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
abound marvellously.And there were vessels that are wrought by magic
of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that
he blases in to them like to bubbles.

strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be
possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.And these
fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of
the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.And
also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a
compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of
certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like
to a vast mountain.And they teach the serpents there to entwine
themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of
these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp

Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat

older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights
virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke
to him full gently.But, said he, or it be long too she will bring
forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath
waited marvellous long.And the franklin that had drunken said,
Expecting each moment to be her next.Also he took the cup that stood
tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to
drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far
as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his
lustiness.And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat

ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight
of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged
him courtly in the cup.Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
drunken an they might.

There was a sort of scholars along either side
the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary
Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of
medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa,
one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at
head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long

Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and
beside the meek sir Leopold.But on young Malachi they waited for that
he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how
he had broke his avow.And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast
friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that
his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as
they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.Ruth red
him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.For they were right witty scholars.And he heard their aresouns each
gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining
that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen

Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it
was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the
law nor his judges did provide no remedy.A redress God grant.This was
scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother,
the wife should live and the babe to die.In colour whereof they waxed
hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but
the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at
the least way mirth might not lack.Then young Madden showed all the
whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion
sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint
Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby
they were all wondrous grieved.To whom young Stephen had these words
following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.Both babe and
parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in
purgefire.But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we
nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very
God, Lord and Giver of Life?For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.We
are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends
than we.Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.

But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was
that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or
leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that
beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the
other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they
did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his
engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to
do.Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir
Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour
which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare
whoso she might be or wheresoever.Then spake young Stephen orgulous of
mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons,
of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of
brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius

that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which
rock was holy church for all ages founded.All they bachelors then

risk life to save life.A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted
all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that
as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a
layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an
accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had
birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their
questions.That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant
word.Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he
averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he
was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that
taking it appeared eftsoons.But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and
as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
could save so dark is destiny.

And she was wondrous stricken of heart
for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir
Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him
his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness
and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for
all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
murdered his goods with whores.About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying
for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge

It was an

habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her
hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of
them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness
some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all
chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at,
thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou
chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou,
to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the
good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet,
margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and
most worthy to be most sacred.In Horne’s house rest should reign.To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in
Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he
had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the
womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.Master
Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds
and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue
of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all
intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.But he
said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was
the eternal son and ever virgin.

Thereat mirth grew in them the more
and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing
and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island,
she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain,
with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries
and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was
there unmaided.He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those
delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is
in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers:
_To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable
concent upon the virginals.An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most
mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous
flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium
of connubial communion.Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed,
but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher
for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.Young Stephen
said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between
them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for
life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved
with it.Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay
down his wife for his friend.Go thou and do likewise.

pro memetipso_.And all the people shall say, Amen.Remember, Erin, thy
generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by
my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication
in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.Therefore hast thou
sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of
servants.Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.Why
hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for
a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian
of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?Look forth
now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo
and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with
milk and money.But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon
and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.And thou hast left me alone for
ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast
thou kissed my mouth.This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to
say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much

inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads
forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis
that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto

Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave

him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but
on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit
near by which he did mighty brisk.He was a kind of sport gentleman
that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of
women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.

To tell the truth he
was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the
coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men,
runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues

gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a
bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his

he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar
with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.One
time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought
would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for
the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk,
kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’
linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.He had been off as many times
as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to
his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw
him.What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to
know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?I protest I saw them but
this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.I can scarce

beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been
some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster
that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr
Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.I question with you there, says he.More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.

Mr Stephen, a little

dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the

island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with
an emerald ring in his nose.True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the

coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his
nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
were no better off than himself.So be off now, says he, and do all my

nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young
ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.Another then put in his
word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat
with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his
forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables
for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of
the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his
heart’s content.By this time the father of the faithful (for so they
called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.To
remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in
their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on
his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow
out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.Ay, says another,
and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the
land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his
mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the
island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the
grass that grows on the ground.

And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got
scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a
husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or
a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting
up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the
lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an
old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in
his matters, says he.I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with
the help of that good pizzle my father left me.But one evening, says
Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to
dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the
first rule of the course was that the others were to row with
pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and
on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he
found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for
boss of the show.After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his
head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers
and pulling it out again told them all his new name.

ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write
it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or
a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.In short, he and the bull of Ireland
were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.They were, says Mr
Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was

loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all
masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread
three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed
anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times
three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea

project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
on.Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend
printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.Fertiliser and
Incubator.Lambay Island_.His project, as he went on to expound, was
to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief
business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and
to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has
been framed.Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.I
make no doubt it smacks of wenching.Come, be seated, both.’Tis as
cheap sitting as standing.Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and,
expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into
this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the
inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were
due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as
whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from
proclivities acquired.

It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the
nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so
many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest
bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial
cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some
unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness,
sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty
fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart
weep.To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a
suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of
worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in
fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord
Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our
ascendancy party.He proposed to set up there a national fertilising
farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the
fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the
fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there
direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her
natural.Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for
his pains.The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of
fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm
persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.

For his
nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet
of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
chillies.After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief
with which he had shielded it.They both, it seems, had been overtaken
by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as
might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which
was now somewhat piebald.His project meanwhile was very favourably
entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr
Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he
purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.Mr Mulligan however made
court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as
it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of
his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut
matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder
wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more
suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the
farmyard drake and duck.

Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
man of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
advanced.The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
nearest neighbour.Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for
whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
assistance we could give?Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he
was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was
in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he
fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.Mr
Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the
stomach.For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls,
smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable
droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex
though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a
bastard.

This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth
and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some
larum in the antechamber.Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was
ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it._Mais bien
sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.That
you may and very opportunely.There wanted nothing but this cup to
crown my felicity.But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in
my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept
of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give
thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver
of good things.With these words he approached the goblet to his lips,
took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening
his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.

Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands
of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.I declare, I was never
so touched in all my life.God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
favours.A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great
and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in
thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished
coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of
maturer years.But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.How mingled
and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.Maledicity!he exclaimed in
anguish.Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my
cloak along!I could weep to think of it.Then, though it had poured
seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.

But beshrew me,
he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day
and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur
Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the
French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.Tut, tut!cries Le
Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most
accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in
a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape
Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even
the stoutest cloak.A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans
blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest
posthaste to another world.Pooh!A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.The
clumsy things are dear at a sou.One umbrella, were it no bigger than a
fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.No woman of any wit would
wear one.My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge
before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she
reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there
was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the
divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a
household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our
original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is
the fittest, nay, the only garment.

The first, said she (and here my
pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my
attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear),
the first is a bath...But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall
cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of
our store of knowledge.Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
a profound bow to the company.The presence even for a moment among a
party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
ribaldry.Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh!I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused
you.What, you dog?Have you a way with them?Gad’s bud, immensely so,
said Mr Lynch.The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater
hospice.Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the
chin.As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been
wardmaid there any time these seven months.Lawksamercy, doctor, cried
the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and
with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body!Drat the
man!Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.

Why, you’re as bad as dear
little Father Cantekissem, that you are!May this pot of four half
choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.I knows a lady
what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.The young
surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as
the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings
of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable
fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.I want patience,
said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to
instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence
due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.I
am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of
witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far
from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human
breast.I cannot away with them.What?Malign such an one, the amiable
Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of
ours?And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child
of clay?Perish the thought!I shudder to think of the future of a race
where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right
reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.Having
delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and
repaired to the door.

A murmur of approval arose from all and some were
for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have
been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had
he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid
imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of
the true fold as ever drew breath.Stap my vitals, said he, them was
always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most
particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand
to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks
back on with a loving heart.To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of
some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as
overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were
difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.But the word of Mr
Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch
that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born
out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into
the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent
indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.

It was
now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had
passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a
wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his
heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting
them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that
plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn
and all find tolerable and but tolerable.To those who create
themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which
he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the
name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such
that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the
sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a
precipitate and inglorious retreat.Not but what he could feel with
mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the
gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy
Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far
forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a
gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.To conclude, while
from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was,
however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence
that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now
testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the
Supreme Being.

Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to
express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid
genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her
confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that
expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian
matron.I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table
so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum
was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring
through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he
calls her.I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event
would burst anon.’Slife, I’ll be round with you.I cannot but extol
the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another
child out of her.All fell to praising of it, each after his own
fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that
another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in
orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed
in every household.

Singular, communed the guest with himself, the
wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that
the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the
seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic
titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of
levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise
eminent have esteemed the noblest.But, he further added, it is mayhap
to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have
more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal
polity?Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
counselled?During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a
tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per
cents?Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?Or is
it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own
dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady,
the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant
reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it
was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.

nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn
from the lowest strata of society!Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush
not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with
Hagar, the Egyptian!In the question of the grazing lands his peevish
asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from
an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as
straightforward as they were bucolic.It ill becomes him to preach that
gospel.Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the
want of the ploughshare?A habit reprehensible at puberty is second
nature and an opprobrium in middle life.If he must dispense his balm
of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to
health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist
better with the doctrines that now engross him.His marital breast is
the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.

The
lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort
neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of
ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native
orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but,
transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant,
acid and inoperative.The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial
usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the
junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the
delegation that an heir had been born.When he had betaken himself to
the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the
afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic
affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous
exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and
solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would
palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
tongues.In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
to urge, to mollify, to refrain.The moment was too propitious for the

Every phase of the situation was
successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers,
the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that
rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as
the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr
Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused,
the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and
triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the
acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the
agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan)
in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the
medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other
spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation
of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the
vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in
the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix,
artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb
consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the
species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that
distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers
_Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and
monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of
consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which
Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic
illustrations.

The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine
were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the
state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step
over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should
strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a
yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand
against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the
seat of castigation.The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole,
supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain
were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical
explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens
was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born.The
hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and
worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for,
envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some
stage antecedent to the human.An outlandish delegate sustained against
both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the
theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his
authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of
the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down
to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.The impression made by his
words was immediate but shortlived.It was effaced as easily as it had
been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of
pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as
the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.

Contemporaneously,
a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr
Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created
in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty
by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant
submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.Hitherto silent, whether the
better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the
ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has
joined.But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.He conjured up
the scene before them.The secret panel beside the chimney slid back
and in the recess appeared... Haines!Which of us did not feel his
flesh creep!He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand,
in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were
depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.I
anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for
which, it seems, history is to blame.Yes, it is true.I am the
murderer of Samuel Childs.And how I am punished!The inferno has no
terrors for me.This is the appearance is on me.Tare and ages, what

young Leopold.There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror
within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.That young figure
of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from
the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel
on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a
mother’s thought.Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in
his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a
fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook,
a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright
trinketware (alas!a thing now of the past!)and a quiverful of
compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out
upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but
the heart?tell me!)his studied baisemoins.The scent, the smile, but,
more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at
duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s
pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you
may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some
paper from the Europe of a month before.But hey, presto, the mirror is
breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a
tiny speck within the mist.Now he is himself paternal and these about
him might be his sons.Who can say?The wise father knows his own
child.

He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the
bonded stores there, the first.Together (she is a poor waif, a child
of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her
luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two
raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.Bridie!Bridie Kelly!He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night,
the bridenight.They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer
with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the
world.Did heart leap to heart?Nay, fair reader.In a breath ’twas
done but—hold!Back!It must not be!In terror the poor girl flees away
through the murk.She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.No, Leopold.Name and
memory solace thee not.That youthful illusion of thy strength was
taken from thee—and in vain.No son of thy loins is by thee.There is
none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over
regions of cycles of generations that have lived.A region where grey
twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields,
shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.She follows her
mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.

shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.Agendath is a waste land, a home
of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.Netaim, the golden, is no more.And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of
rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.Huuh!Hark!Huuh!Parallax stalks
behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are
scorpions.Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and
mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.Ominous
revengeful zodiacal host!They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned
and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the
giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all
their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.And the equine
portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s
own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.And lo,

How serene does she
now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan

call it gossamer.It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and
loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on
currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply
swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a
myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled
sign upon the forehead of Taurus.Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
school together in Conmee’s time.He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
Pisistratus.Where were they now?Neither knew.You have spoken of the
past and its phantoms, Stephen said.Why think of them?If I call them
into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
my call?Who supposes it?I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
bard, am lord and giver of their life.He encircled his gadding hair
with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.That answer and those
leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your

could not leave his mother an orphan.The young man’s face grew dark.All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and
of his recent loss.He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the

Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.He told
them of the race.The flag fell and, huuh!off, scamper, the mare ran
out freshly with O. Madden up.She was leading the field.All hearts
were beating.Even Phyllis could not contain herself.She waved her
scarf and cried: Huzzah!Sceptre wins!But in the straight on the run
home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level,
reached, outstripped her.All was lost now.Phyllis was silent: her
eyes were sad anemones.Juno, she cried, I am undone.But her lover
consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some
oval sugarplums which she partook.A tear fell: one only.A whacking
fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane.Four winners yesterday and three

buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.But let us bear it
as was the ancient wont.Mercy on the luckless!Poor Sceptre!he said

you remember her, Vincent?

I wish you could have seen my queen today,
Vincent said.How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair
beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the
right name of it.The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air
drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.In
the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of
those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his
booth near the bridge.But she had nought for her teeth but the arm
with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I
pressed too close.A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but
today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.She is more taking then.Her posies too!Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we
reclined together.And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who
met us as we left the field.Conmee himself!He was walking by the
hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty
letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.The sweet creature
turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight
disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very
trees adore her.When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo
in that little mirror she carries.But he had been kind.In going by he
had blessed us.The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.If I had poor
luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
propensely.

He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.His soul is far
away.It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born.Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods.Do you not think it, Stephen?Theosophos
told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.The lords of the
moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of
the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were
therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
constellation.However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which
was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was
not the case at all.The individual whose visual organs while the above
was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
speedily in the wrong shop.During the past four minutes or thereabouts
he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its
scarlet appearance.

He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.Eventually, however, both
their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other
was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily
determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the
neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid
sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out
with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of
attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it
about the place.The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
course of life.Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.The
debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
the loftiest and most vital.The high hall of Horne’s house had never
beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old
rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
encyclopaedic.A gallant scene in truth it made.Crotthers was there at
the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.There too, opposite to
him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early
depravity and premature wisdom.Next the Scotchman was the place
assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in
stolid repose the squat form of Madden.

The chair of the resident
indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the
figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide
brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred
manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.Lastly at the head of the
board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of
pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of
Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated
the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that
vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained
by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and
constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever
efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired
pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
transcendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div.Scep.)contentions
would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter
to accepted scientific methods.Science, it cannot be too often
repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.The man of science like the
man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked
and explain them as best he can.There may be, it is true, some
questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first
problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb.Canv.)regarding the future
determination of sex.

Must we accept the view of Empedocles of
Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert
others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long
neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is
it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper,
Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture
of both?This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s
favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on
the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus
felix_, of the passive element.The other problem raised by the same
inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.It is interesting
because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but
we all die in different ways.Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg.et Eug.Doc.)blames
the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract
adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.by inhaling the bacteria which lurk
in dust.These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles
offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers
of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic
cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors
and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and
every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.

Kalipedia, he prophesied,
would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely
good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive
pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as
Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all
these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular
condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.Mr
J. Crotthers (Disc.Bacc.)attributes some of these demises to
abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy
labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by
far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in
the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or
in the atrocious crime of infanticide.Although the former (we are
thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of
nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too
rare to be normative.In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder
is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do,
all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
often baulk nature in her intentions.An ingenious suggestion is that
thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc.Arith.)that both natality and
mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal
movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general,
everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of
some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which
beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet
unascertained.

Still the plain straightforward question why a child of
normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly
looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other
children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s
words, give us pause.Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and
cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths
are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous
germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively
shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend
to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an
arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings
(notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long
run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival
of the fittest.Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div.Scep.)remark (or should it be
called an interruption?)that an omnivorous being which can masticate,
deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with
pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous
females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not
to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly
find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals
as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above
alluded to.

that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed
victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly
dropped from its mother.In a recent public controversy with Mr L.
Bloom (Pubb.Canv.)which took place in the commons’ hall of the
National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as
is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic.in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P.I.)is the
able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having
stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s
allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of
all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out
again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.At the risk
of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the
less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was
delivered.Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient
and doctor.All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave
woman had manfully helped.She had.She had fought the good fight and
now she was very very happy.

Those who have passed on, who have gone
before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching

motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty
sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood,
breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal
Husband.And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one
blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy,
to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful
embraces.He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle
stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity
has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank,

ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the
curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!)and dout the light
whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so
with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.He knows and will call in His
own good time.You too have fought the good fight and played loyally
your man’s part.Sir, to you my hand.Well done, thou good and faithful
servant!There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil
memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the
heart but they abide there and wait.He may suffer their memory to grow
dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade
himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.Yet a chance
word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront
him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while
timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility
of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with
wine.Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies
under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but
shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote,
reproachful.

The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of
that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied
trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.A scene
disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a
word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present
there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.A shaven space
of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at
Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game
but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward
over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief
alert shock.And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at
times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood,
Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of
arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of
them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin
so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.A lad of four or five in
linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth
when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the
urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.

the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family.An
acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate

refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of
loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly
rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one
