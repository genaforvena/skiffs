An examination of the Christian teaching: first according to its interpretation by the Orthodox Russo-Greek Church, then according to its interpretation by the Church in general—by the Apostles, the Councils, the so-called Fathers of the Church—and an exposure of what is false in those interpretations.An examination of Christian teaching not according to those interpretations but solely according to what has come down to us of Christ's teaching, as ascribed to him in the Gospels.An exposition of the real meaning of Christ's teaching, the reasons why it has been perverted, and the consequences to which it should lead.From the third of those parts the present account has been compiled.The harmonization of the four Gospels has been in accord with the sense of the teaching.In making it I hardly had to digress from the order in which it is set down in the Gospels, so that there are not more but fewer transpositions of the verses than in most of the concordances known to me, or than in Grechulévich's arrangement of the Four Gospels.In my treatment of the Gospel of John there are no transpositions, but everything follows the order of the original.The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters (or six if each two be united) came about of itself from the sense of the teaching.This is the meaning of those chapters:Man is the son of an infinite source: a son of that Father not by the flesh but by the spirit.Therefore man should serve that source in spirit.The life of all men has a divine origin.It alone is holy.Therefore man should serve that source in the life of all men.Such is the will of the Father.The service of the will of that Father of life gives life.Therefore the gratification of one's own will is not necessary for life.Temporal life is food for the true life.Therefore the true life is independent of time: it is in the present.Summarization models summary:

Time is an illusion of life; life in the past and in the future conceals from men the true life of the present.Therefore man should strive to destroy the illusion of the temporal life of the past and future.True life is life in the present, common to all men and manifesting itself in love.Therefore he who lives by love in the present, through the common life of all men, unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life.So each two chapters are related as cause and effect.In addition to these twelve chapters an introduction from the first chapter of the Gospel of John is added, in which the writer of that Gospel speaks, in his own name, as to the meaning of the whole teaching, and a conclusion from the same writer's Epistle (written probably before the Gospel) containing a general deduction from all that precedes.These two parts do not form an essential part of the teaching, but though they both might be omitted without losing the sense of the teaching (the more so as they come in the name of John and not of Jesus)—I have retained them because in a straightforward understanding of Christ's teaching these parts, confirming one another an the whole, furnish, in contradiction to the queer interpretation of the Churches, the plainest indication of the meaning that should be ascribed to the teaching.At the beginning of each chapter, besides a brief indication of its subject, I have given the words which correspond to that chapter from the prayer Jesus taught his disciples.When I had finished my work I found to my surprise and joy that the Lord's Prayer is nothing but a very concise expression of the whole teaching of Jesus in the very order in which I had arranged the chapters, and that each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters:1.Our Father, Man is a son of God.2.Which art in Heaven, God is the infinite spiritual source of life.3.Hallowed be Thy Name, May this source of life be held holy.

4.Thy Kingdom come, May his power be realized in all men.5.Thy will be done, as in heaven, May the will of this infinite source be fulfilled as it is in himself,6. so on earth.so also in the bodily life.7.Give us our daily bread Temporal life is the food of the true life.8. each day.True life is in the present.9.And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.And let not the mistakes and errors of the past hide that true life from us.10.And lead us not into temptation, And may they not lead us into delusion,11.But deliver us from evil, And so there shall be no evil.12.For thine is the kingdom the power, and the glory.And may thy power, and strength, and wisdom, prevail.In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down without any omissions.But in the present rendering the following are omitted: the conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, his mother's flight with him to Egypt; his miracles at Cana and Caperaum; the casting out of the devils; the walking on the sea; the blasting of the fig-tree; the healing of the sick; the raising of the dead; the resurrection of Christ himself, and the references to prophecies fulfilled by his life.Those passages are omitted in the present short exposition because, containing nothing of the teaching but only describing events that took place before, during, or after the period in which Jesus taught, they complicate the exposition.Those verses, however they may be understood, do not contain either contradiction or confirmation of the teaching.Their sole significance for Christianity was to prove the divinity of Jesus to those who did not believe in it.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
But for one who understands that a story of miracles is unconvincing, and who also doubts that the divinity of Jesus is asserted in his teaching, those verses drop away of themselves as superfluous.In the larger work every deviation from the ordinary version, as well as every inserted comment and every omission, is explained and justified by comparison of the different variants of the Gospels, by examination of contexts, and by philological and other considerations.In the present brief rendering all such proofs and refutations of the false understanding of the Churches, as well as the detailed notes and references, are omitted, on the ground that however exact and correct the discussions of each separate passage may be, they cannot carry conviction as to the true understanding of the teaching.The justness of the understanding of the teaching is better proved not by the discussion of particular passages but by its own unity, clarity, simplicity and completeness, and by its accordance with the inner feeling of all who seek the truth.In respect of all the divergences of my rendering from the Church's authorized text, the reader should not forget that the customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error.The reader should remember that Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato, Philo, or Marcus Aurelius did; nor even, like Socrates, transmitted his teaching to educated men, but that he spoke to many uneducated men and only long after his death did people begin to write down what they had heard about him.The reader should remember that there were very many such accounts from among which the Churches selected first three Gospels and then one more, and that in selecting those best Gospels—as the proverb, 'There is no stick without knots' says—they had to take in many knots with what they selected from the whole mass of writings about Christ, and that there are many passages in the canonical Gospels just as poor as in the rejected apocryphal ones.

The reader should remember that it is the teaching of Christ which may be sacred, but certainly not any definite number of verses and syllables, and that certain verses picked out from here to there cannot become sacred merely because people say they are.Moreover the reader should remember that these selected Gospels are also the work of thousands of different human brains and hands, that they have been selected, added to, and commented on, for centuries, that all the copies that have come down to us from the fourth century are written in continuous script without punctuation, so that even after the fourth and fifth centuries they have been subject to very diverse readings, and that there are not less than fifty thousand such variations of the Gospels.This should all be borne in mind by the reader, that he may not be misled by the customary view that the Gospels in their present form have come to us direct from the Holy Ghost.The reader should remember that far from it being blameworthy to discard useless passages from the Gospels and elucidate some passages by others, it is on the contrary irrational not to do so and to hold a certain number of verses and syllables as sacred.On the other hand I beg readers to remember that if I do not regard the Gospels as sacred books that have come down to us from the Holy Ghost, even less do I regard them as mere historical monuments of religious literature.I understand the theological as well as the historical view of the Gospels, but regard them myself differently, and so I beg the reader not to be confused either by the church view or by the historical view customary in our day among educated people, neither of which do I hold.I regard Christianity neither as an inclusive divine revelation nor as an historical phenomenon, but as a teaching which gives us the meaning of life.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this—that when I was fifty years old, having asked myself and all the learned men around me what I am and what is the meaning of my life, and received the answer that I am a fortuitous concatenation of atoms and that life has no meaning but is itself an evil, I fell into despair and wanted to put an end to my life; but I remembered that formerly in childhood when I believed, life had a meaning for me, and that for the great mass of men about me who believe and are not corrupted by riches life has a meaning; and I doubted the validity of the reply given me by the learned men of my circle and I tried to understand the reply Christianity gives to those who live a real life.And I began to seek Christianity in the Christian teaching that guides such men's lives.I began to study the Christianity which I saw applied in life and to compare that applied Christianity with its source.The source of Christian teaching is the Gospels, and in them I found the explanation of the spirit which guides the life of all who really live.But together with this source of the pure water of life I found, wrongfully united with it, mud and slime which had hidden its purity from me: by the side of and bound up with the lofty Christian teaching I found a Hebrew and a Church teaching alien to it.I was in the position of a man who receives a bag of stinking dirt, and only after long struggle and much labor finds that amid that dirt lie priceless pearls; and he understands that he was not to blame for disliking the stinking dirt, and that those who have collected and preserved these pearls together with the dirt are also not to blame but deserve love and respect.

I did not know the light and had thought there was no light of truth to be found in life, but having convinced myself that men live by that light alone, I began to look for its source and found it in the Gospels, despite the false Church interpretations.And on reaching that source of light I was dazzled by it, and found full replies to my questions as to the meaning of my own life and that of others—answers in full agreement with those I knew of from other nations, but which in my opinion were superior to them all.I was looking for an answer to the question of life and not to theological or historical questions, and so for me the chief question was not whether Jesus was or was not God, or from whom the Holy Ghost proceeded and so forth, and equally unimportant and unnecessary was it for me to know when and by whom each Gospel was written and whether such and such a parable may, or may not, be ascribed to Christ.What was important to me was this light which has enlightened mankind for eighteen hundred years and which enlightened and still enlightens me; but how to name the source of that light, and what materials he or someone else had kindled, did not concern me.On that this preface might end were the Gospels recently discovered books and had Christ's teaching not suffered eighteen hundred years of false interpretation.But now to understand the teaching of Jesus it is necessary to know clearly the chief methods used in these false interpretations.The most customary method of false interpretation, and one which we have grown up with, consists of preaching under the name of Christianity not what Christ taught but a church teaching composed of explanations of very contradictory writings into which Christ's teaching enters only to a small degree, and even then distorted and twisted to fit together with other writings.According to this false interpretation Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations beginning with the commencement of the world and continuing in the Church until now.Summarization models summary:

These false interpreters call Jesus God; but the fact that they recognize him as God does not make them attribute more importance to his words and teaching than to the words of the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, the Apocalypse, or even to the decisions of the Councils and the writings of the Fathers of the Church.These false interpreters do not admit any understanding of the teaching of Jesus which does not conform to the previous and subsequent revelations; so that their aim is not to explain the meaning of Christ's teaching, but as far as possible to harmonize various extremely contradictory writings, such as the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Acts—that is, all that is supposed to constitute the Holy Scriptures.Such explanations aiming not at truth but at reconciling the irreconcilable, namely, the writings of the Old and the New Testament, can obviously be innumerable, as indeed they are.Among them are the Epistles of Paul and the decisions of the Councils (which begin with the formulary: 'It has pleased Us and the Holy Ghost'), and such enactments as those of the Popes, the Synods, the pseudo-Christs, and all the false interpreters who affirm that the Holy Ghost speaks through their lips.They all employ one and the same gross method of affirming the truth of their interpretations by the assertion that their interpretations are not human utterances but revelations from the Holy Ghost.Without entering on an examination of these beliefs, each of which calls itself the true one, one cannot help seeing that by the method common to them all of acknowledging the whole immense quantity of so-called scriptures of the Old and New Testament as equally sacred, they themselves impose an insuperable obstacle to an understanding of Christ's teaching; and that from this mistake arises the possibility and inevitability of endlessly divergent interpretations of the teaching.

The reconcilement of a number of revelations can be infinitely varied, but the interpretation of the teaching of one person (and one looked upon as God) should not occasion discord.If God descended to earth to teach people, his teaching, by the very purpose of his coming, cannot be understood in more than one way.If God came down to earth to reveal truth to men, at least he would have revealed it so that all might understand: if he did not do that he was not God; and if the divine truths are such that even God could not make them intelligible to mankind, men certainly cannot do so.If Jesus is not God, but a great man, then still less can his teaching produce discord.For the teaching of a great man is only great because it expresses intelligibly and clearly what others have expressed unintelligibly and obscurely.What is incomprehensible in a great man's teaching is not great, and therefore a great man's teaching does not engender sects.Only an exposition which affirms that it is a revelation from the Holy Ghost and is the sole truth, and that all other expositions are lies, gives birth to discord and to the mutual animosities among the Churches that result therefrom.However much the various Churches affirm that they do not condemn other communities, that they have no hatred of them but pray for union, it is untrue.Never, since the time of Arius, has the affirmation of any dogma arisen from any other cause than the desire to condemn a contrary belief as false.It is a supreme degree of pride and ill will to others to assert that a particular dogma is a divine revelation proceeding from the Holy Ghost: the highest presumption because nothing more arrogant can be said than that the words spoken by me are uttered through me by God; and the greatest ill will because the avowal of oneself as in possession of the sole indubitable truth implies an assertion of the falsity of all who disagree.Summarization models summary:

Yet that is just what all the Churches say, and from this alone flows and has flowed all the evil which has been committed and still is committed in the world in the name of religion.But besides the temporary evil which such an interpretation by the Churches and the sects produces, it has another important inner defect which gives an obscure, indefinite, and insincere character to their assertions.This defect consists in the fact that all the Churches—having acknowledged the latest revelation of the Holy Ghost, who descended on the apostles and has passed and still passes to the supposedly elect—nowhere define directly, definitely, and finally, in what that revelation consists; and yet they base their belief on that supposedly continuing revelation and call it Christian.All the churchmen who acknowledge the revelation from the Holy Ghost recognize (like the Mohammedans) three revelations: that of Moses, of Jesus, and of the Holy Ghost.But in the Mohammedan religion it is believed that after Moses and Jesus, Mahomet is the last of the prophets and that he explained the revelations of Moses and Jesus, and this revelation of Mahomet every True Believer has before him.But it is not so with the Church faith.That also, like the Mohammedan, acknowledges three revelations: that of Moses, of Jesus, and of the Holy Ghost, but it does not call itself Holy Ghostism after the name of the last revealer, but affirms that the basis of its faith is the teaching of Christ.So that while preaching its own doctrines it attributes their authority to Christ.Churchmen acknowledging the last revelation explaining all previous ones, should say so and call their religion by the name of whoever received the last revelation— acknowledging it to be that of Paul, or of this or that Council of the Church, or of the Pope, or of the Patriarch.

And if the last revelation was that of the Fathers, a decree of the Eastern Patriarchs, a Papal encyclical, or the syllabus or catechism of Luther or of Philaret—they should say so and call their religion accordingly, because the last revelation which explains all the preceding is always the most important one.But they do not do so, but while preaching doctrines quite alien to Christ's teaching, affirm that their doctrine was taught by Christ.So that according to their teaching Jesus declared that by his blood he had redeemed the human race ruined by Adam's sins; that God is three persons; that the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles and was transmitted to the priesthood by the laying on of hands; that seven sacraments are necessary for salvation; that communion should be received in two kinds, and so on.They would have us believe that all this is the teaching of Jesus, whereas in reality there is not a word about any of it in his teaching.Those false teachers should call their teaching and religion the teaching and religion of the Holy Ghost but not of Christ; for only that faith can be called Christian which recognizes the revelation of Christ reaching us in the Gospels as the final revelation.It would seem that the matter is plain and not worth speaking about, but, strange to say, up to now the teaching of Christ is not separated on the one side from an artificial and quite unjustifiable amalgamation with the Old Testament, and on the other from the arbitrary additions and perversions made in the name of the Holy Ghost.To this day there are some who, calling Jesus the second person of the Trinity, do not conceive of his teaching otherwise than in conjunction with those pseudo revelations of the third Person which they find in the Old Testament, the Epistles, the decrees of the Councils and the decisions of the Fathers, and they preach the strangest beliefs, affirming them to be the religion of Christ.Summarization models summary:

Others not acknowledging Jesus as God, similarly conceive of his teaching not as he could have taught it but as understood by Paul and other commentators.While regarding Jesus not as God but as a man, these commentators deny him a most legitimate human right, that of answering only for his own words and not for false interpretations of them.Trying to explain his teaching, these learned commentators attribute to Jesus things he never thought of saying.The representatives of this school of interpreters—beginning with the most popular of them, Renan—without troubling to separate what Jesus himself taught from what the slanders of his commentators have laid upon him, and without troubling to understand his teaching more profoundly, try to understand the meaning of his appearance and the spread of his teaching by the events of his life and the circumstances of his time.The problem that confronts them is this: eighteen hundred years ago a certain pauper appeared and said certain things.He was flogged and executed.And ever since that time (though there have been numbers of just men who died for their faith), milliards of people, wise and foolish, learned and ignorant, have clung to the belief that this man alone among men was God.How is this amazing fact to be explained?The churchmen say that it occurred because Jesus was God.In that case it is all understandable.But if he was not God how are we to explain that everyone looked upon just this common man as God?And the learned men of that school assiduously explore every detail of the life of Jesus, without noticing that however much they explore those details (in reality they have gathered none), even if they were able to reconstruct his whole life in the minutest detail, the question why he, just he, had such an influence on people would still remain unanswered.

The answer is not to be found in knowledge of the society Jesus was born into, or how he was educated, and so on, still less is it to be found in knowledge of what was being done in Rome, or in the fact that the people of that time were inclined to superstition, but only by knowing what this man preached that has caused people, from that time to this, to distinguish him from all others and to acknowledge him as God.It would seem that the first thing to do is to try to understand that man's teaching, and naturally his own teaching and not coarse interpretations of it that have been spread since his time.But this is not done.These learned historians of Christianity are so pleased to have understood that Jesus was not God and are so anxious to prove that his teaching is not divine and is therefore not obligatory, that—forgetting that the more they prove him to have been an ordinary man and his teaching not to be divine the further they are from solving the problem before them—they strain all their strength to do so.To see this surprising error clearly, it is worth recalling an article by Havet, a follower of Renan's, who affirms that Jésus Christ n'avait rien de chrétien, or Souris, who enthusiastically argues that Jesus Christ was a very coarse and stupid man.The essential thing is, not to prove that Jesus was not God and that therefore his doctrine is not divine, or to prove that he was a Catholic, but to know in all its purity what constituted that teaching which was so lofty and so precious to men that they have acknowledged and still acknowledge its preacher to have been God.Summarization models summary:

And so if the reader belongs to the great majority of educated people brought up in the Church belief but who have abandoned its incompatibilities with common sense and conscience—whether he has retained a love and respect for the spirit of the Christian teaching or (as the proverb puts it 'has thrown his fur coat into the fire because he is angry with the bugs') considers all Christianity a harmful superstition—I ask him to remember that what repels him and seems to him a superstition is not the teaching of Christ; that Christ cannot be held responsible for the monstrous tradition that has been interwoven with his teaching and presented as Christianity: that to judge of Christianity, only the teaching of Christ as it has come down to us must be learned—that is, the words and actions attributed to Christ and that have an instructive meaning.Studying the teaching of Christ in that way the reader will convince himself that Christianity, far from being a mixture of the lofty and the low, or a superstition, is a very strict, pure, and complete metaphysical and ethical doctrine, higher than which the reason of man has not yet reached, and in the orbit of which (without recognizing the fact) human activity—political, learned, poetic, and philosophic—is moving.If the reader belongs to that small minority of educated people who hold to the Church religion and profess it not for outward purposes but for inward tranquillity, I ask him to remember that the teaching of Christ as set forth in this book (despite the identity of name) is quite a different teaching from that which he professes, and that therefore the question for him is not whether the doctrine here offered agrees or disagrees with his belief, but is simply, which best accords with his reason and conscience—the Church teaching composed of adjustments of many scriptures, or the teaching of Christ alone?The question for him is merely whether he wishes to accept the new teaching or to retain his own belief.

But if the reader is one of those who outwardly profess the Church creed and values it not because he believes it to be true but because he considers that to profess and preach it is profitable to him, then let him remember that however many adherents he may have, however powerful they may be, on whatever thrones they may sit, and by whatever great names they may call themselves, he is not one of the accusers but of the accused.Let such readers remember that there is nothing for them to prove, that they have long ago said what they had to say and that even if they could prove what they wish to, they would only prove, each for himself, what is proved by all the hundreds of opposing Churches; and that it is not for them to demonstrate, but to excuse themselves: to excuse themselves for the blasphemy of adjusting the teaching of the God-Christ to suit the teaching of Ezras, of the Councils, and Theophilacts, and allowing themselves to interpret and alter the words of God in conformity with the words of men; to excuse themselves for their libels on God by which they have thrown all the fanaticism they had in their hearts onto the God-Jesus and given it out as his teaching; to excuse themselves for the fraud by which, having hidden the teaching of God who came to bestow blessing on the world, they have replaced it by their own blasphemous creed, and by that substitution have deprived and still deprive milliards of people of the blessing Christ brought to men, and instead of the peace and love he brought have introduced into the world sects, condemnations, murders, and all manner of crimes.For such readers there are only two ways out: humble confession and renunciation of their lies, or a persecution of those who expose them for what they have done and are still doing.Summarization models summary:

They replied: Teacher, we wish to be with you and to know your teaching.He said: Come with me and I will tell you everything.They went with him and stayed with him, listening to him till ten o'clock.One of these pupils was called Andrew.He had a brother Simon.Having heard Jesus, Andrew went to his brother Simon and said to him: We have found him of whom the prophets wrote—the Messiah—he has told us of our salvation.Andrew took Simon and brought him also to Jesus.Jesus called this brother of Andrew's, Peter, which means a stone.And both these brothers became pupils of Jesus.Afterwards, before entering Galilee, Jesus met Philip and called him to go with him.Philip was from Bethsaida and a fellow-villager of Peter and Andrew.When Philip had got to know Jesus he went and found his brother Nathanael and said to him: We have found the chosen of God of whom Moses and the prophets wrote.This is Jesus, the son of Joseph of Nazareth.Nathanael was surprised that he of whom the prophets wrote should be from a neighbouring village, and he said: It is most unlikely that the messenger of God should be from Nazareth.Philip said: Come with me, you shall see and hear for yourself.Nathaniel agreed and went with his brother and met Jesus, and when he had heard him he said to Jesus: Yes, now I see that it is true that you are a son of God and the King of Israel.Jesus said to him: Learn something more important than that: henceforth the heavens are opened and men may be in communion with the heavenly powers.Henceforth God will no longer be separate from men.And Jesus came home to Nazareth and on a holiday went as usual into the Assembly and began to read.They gave him the book of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling it he read.Summarization models summary:

Therefore man should work not for the flesh, but for the spirit.'which art in heaven'IT happened that Jesus was walking across a field with his pupils one Saturday.The pupils were hungry, and on the way they plucked ears of corn and rubbed them in their hands and ate the grain.But according to the teaching of the Orthodox, God had given Moses a law that everyone should observe Saturday and do nothing that day.According to the teaching of the Orthodox, God had ordered that anyone who worked on Saturday should be stoned.The Orthodox noticed that the pupils rubbed ears of corn on a Saturday and said to them: It is wrong to do that on a Saturday.One must not work on Saturday, and you are rubbing ears of corn.God made Saturday holy, and commanded that the breaking of it should be punished by death.Jesus heard this, and said: If you understood what is meant by the words of God: 'I desire love and not sacrifice'—you would not condemn what is harmless.Man is more important than Saturday.It happened another time on a Saturday that when Jesus was teaching in the Assembly a sick woman came to him and asked him to help her.And Jesus began to cure her.The Orthodox church-elder was angry with Jesus, and said to the people: In the law of God it is said: 'There are six days in the week on which to work.'

But Jesus then asked the Orthodox professors of the law: Do you think it is wrong to help a man on Saturday?And they did not know what to answer.Then Jesus said: Deceivers!Does not each of you untie his ox from its manger and take it to water on Saturday?And if his sheep fell into a well would not any one of you pull it out even on Saturday?A man is much better than a sheep: yet you say that it is wrong to help a man.What then do you think we should do on Saturday—good or evil?Save life or destroy it?Good should be done always, even on Saturday.Jesus one day saw a tax-gatherer receiving taxes.The tax-gatherer's name was Matthew.Jesus talked to him and Matthew understood him, liked his teaching, and invited him to his house and showed him hospitality.When Jesus came to Matthew's house some of Matthew's friends were also there—tax-gatherers and unbelievers.Jesus did not disdain them, but he and his pupils sat down with them.And when the Orthodox saw him, they said to his pupils: How is it that your teacher eats with tax-gatherers and unbelievers?For according to the teaching of the Orthodox, God forbids any intercourse with unbelievers.Jesus heard this, and said: He who boasts of good health needs no doctor, but a sick man does.Understand what the words of God mean: 'I desire love and not sacrifice.'I cannot teach a change of faith to those who consider themselves Orthodox, but to those who consider themselves unbelievers.Some Orthodox professors of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem.And they saw that his pupils, and Jesus himself, ate bread without having washed their hands, and these Orthodox began to blame him for that, for they themselves strictly observed the Church tradition as to how the dishes should be washed, and would not eat unless they had been so washed.Summarization models summary:

And they would also not eat anything from the market until they had washed their hands.And the Orthodox professors of the law asked him: Why do you not follow the Church traditions, but take bread with unwashed hands and eat it?And he answered them: How is it that you with your Church traditions break God's commandment?God said to you: 'Honour your father and mother'.But you have arranged that anyone may say: 'I give to God what I used to give to my parents', and then he is not bound to feed his father and mother.So by the Church tradition you break the law of God.Deceivers!Well did the prophet Isaiah say of you: 'Because these people fall down before me only in words, and honour me only with their tongue, while their heart is far from me; and because their fear of me is only a human law which they have learnt by rote, I will do a wonderful, an extraordinary thing among them: the wisdom of their wise men shall be lost, and the understanding of their thinkers shall be dimmed.Woe to those who seek to hide their desires from the Highest, and who do their deeds in darkness.'So it is with you: You neglect what is important in the law—the commandment of God—but observe your own traditions as to the washing of cups!And Jesus called the people to him and said: Hear all of you and understand: there is nothing in the world that entering a man can defile him; but what goes forth from him, that can defile a man.Let love and mercy be in your soul, then all will be clean.Try to understand this.And when he returned home his pupils asked him what those words meant.And he said: Do you also not understand?Do you not understand that what is external, bodily, cannot defile a man?For it does not enter his soul but his belly.It enters his belly and passes out again.

Only that which goes out of him from his soul can defile a man.For out of a man's soul proceed evil, adulteries, obscenity, murders, thefts, covetousness, wrath, deceit, insolence, envy, calumny, pride, and every kind of folly.And this evil is out of man's soul and it alone can defile him.After this came the Passover, and Jesus went to Jerusalem and entered the temple.In the courts of the temple were cattle: cows, bulls, and sheep; and there were cotes for pigeons; and money-changers behind their counters.All this was wanted for offerings to God.The animals were killed and offered up in the Temple.That was how the Jews prayed, as they had been taught by the Orthodox professors of the law.Jesus went into the Temple, plaited a whip, drove all the cattle out of the porch, turned out all the doves, and scattered all the money, and bade them not bring such things into the Temple.He said: The prophet Isaiah said to you: 'The house of God is not the Temple in Jerusalem, but the whole world of God's people.'And the prophet Jeremiah also told you: 'Do not believe the falsehood that the house of God is here; do not believe this, but change your lives: do not judge falsely, do not oppress a stranger, a widow, or an orphan, do not shed innocent blood, and do not come into the house of God and say: Now we can quietly do evil.Do not make my house a den of thieves.'And the Jews objected and said: You say that our way of serving God is wrong.How can you prove that?And Jesus turned to them and said: Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise a new, living temple.And the Jews said: How can you suddenly build a new temple, when this one took forty years to build?Summarization models summary:

And Jesus said to them: I speak to you of what is more important than the temple.You would not speak as you do if you understood the meaning of the prophet's words: 'I, God, do not rejoice in your sacrifices, but in your love of one another.'The living temple is the whole world of men when they love one another.And many people in Jerusalem believed in what he said.But he himself believed in nothing external for he knew that everything is within man.He had no need that anyone should give witness of man, for he knew that the spirit is in man.And Jesus had once to pass through Samaria.He came to the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the place that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, being tired by his journey, sat down by it while his pupils went into the town to fetch bread.And a woman came from Sychar to draw water, and Jesus asked her to give him to drink.She said to him: How is it that you ask me to give you water?For you Jews have no dealings with us Samaritans.But he said to her: If you knew me and knew what I teach you would not say that, but would give me to drink and I would give you the water of life.Whoever drinks of the water from this well will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water of life shall always be satisfied, and it will bring him to everlasting life.The woman understood that he was speaking of divine things, and said to him: I see that you are a prophet and wish to teach me.But how can you teach me divine things when you are a Jew and I am a Samaritan?Our people pray to God upon this mountain, but you Jews say that the house of God is only in Jerusalem.You cannot teach me divine things, for you have one religion and we have another.

Then Jesus said to her: Believe me, woman, the time has arrived when people will come neither to this mountain nor to Jerusalem to pray to the Father.The time has come when the real worshippers of God will honour the heavenly Father in spirit and by their works.The Father has need of such worshippers.The woman did not understand what he meant by saying that God is a spirit, and she said: I have heard that a messenger of God will come, he whom they call the anointed.He will tell us everything.Jesus said to her: It is I who am speaking to you.Do not expect anything more.After this Jesus came to the country of the Jews and lived there with his pupils and taught.At that time John was teaching near Salim, and bathing people in the river Enon, for he had not yet been imprisoned.And a dispute arose between John's pupils and those of Jesus as to which was better—John's cleansing by water, or the teaching of Jesus.And they came to John and said to him: You cleanse with water, but Jesus only teaches, and all go to him.What do you say about him?John said: A man can of himself teach nothing unless God teach him.He who speaks of the earth is of the earth, but he who speaks of God is from God.It cannot be proved whether spoken words are from God or not from God.God is a spirit; He cannot be measured and cannot be proved.He who understands the words of the spirit proves thereby that he is of the spirit.The Father, loving his son, has entrusted everything to him.He who believes in the son has life, but he who does not believe in the son has no life.God is the spirit in man.After this one of the Orthodox came to Jesus and invited him to dinner.Jesus went in and sat down to table.The Orthodox man noticed that Jesus did not wash before the meal and was surprised.Summarization models summary:

Jesus said to him: You Orthodox people wash everything outside, but is everything clean within you?Be kind to all men, and everything will be clean.And while he was in the house of the Orthodox man, a woman of the town, who was a wrong-doer came there.She had learnt that Jesus was in that house and came there and brought a bottle of perfume.And she knelt at his feet and wept, and wetting his feet with her tears wiped them with her hair, and poured the perfume over them.The Orthodox man saw this and thought to himself: He can hardly be a prophet.If he were really a prophet he would know what sort of a woman it is that is washing his feet: he would know that she is a wrong-doer and would not let her touch him.Jesus, guessing his thought, turned to him and said: Shall I tell you what I think?Yes, do so, replied his host.Then Jesus said: There were two men who held themselves debtors to one master, one for five hundred pieces of money and the other for fifty.And neither of them had anything to pay with.And the creditor forgave them both.Which of them do you think would love the creditor and care for him most?The host replied: He of course that owed most.Then Jesus pointed to the woman and said: So it is with you and this woman.You consider yourself Orthodox, and therefore a small debtor; she considers herself wrong-doer and therefore a great debtor.I came into your house and you did not give me water to wash my feet; she washes them with her tears and wipes them with her hair.You did not kiss me, but she kisses my feet.You gave me no oil for my head, but she anoints my feet with precious perfume.He who considers himself Orthodox will not do works of love; only he who considers himself a wrong-doer will do them.

And for works of love everything is forgiven.And he said to her: Your wickedness is forgiven you.And Jesus said: Everything depends on what a man considers himself to be.He who considers himself good will not be good, but he who considers himself bad is good.And he added: Two men came into the Temple to pray.One was Orthodox, and the other was a tax-farmer.The Orthodox man prayed: I thank thee, O God, that I am not as other men, not miserly, nor a libertine, nor a deceiver, nor such a wretch as that tax-farmer.I fast twice a week, and give away a tenth of my property.But the tax-farmer stood far away, and dared not look up to heaven but only beat his breast, saying: God, look upon me, sinner that I am.This was a better prayer than that of the Orthodox man, for he who exalts himself abases himself, and he who humbles himself raises himself.Then some pupils of John came to Jesus and said: Why do your pupils not fast, while we and the Orthodox fast a great deal?The law of God orders fasting.And Jesus said to them: While the bridegroom is at the wedding no one grieves.Only when the bridegroom has gone do they grieve.Having life, one should not grieve.The external service of God cannot be combined with the activity of love.The old teaching of external service of God cannot be combined with my teaching of active love of one's neighbour.To unite my teaching with the old is like tearing a piece from a new garment and sewing it onto an old one.The new one will be torn and the old one will not be mended.Summarization models summary:

Of what I say they have understood only that I do not fast, and they say: 'He eats and drinks with tax- gatherers and sinners—he is a friend of theirs.'They are like children in the street who chatter to one another and wonder that no one listens to them.And you may judge of their wisdom by what they do.If you went to John to see a man dressed in rich clothes—why, such men live here in the palaces.What then is it you went to see in the wilderness?Did you go because you think John is like other prophets?Do not think so!John is not a prophet like the others.He is more than all the prophets.The others foretold what might happen.He announces what is: namely, that the Kingdom of God was, and is, here on earth.I tell you truly: no one greater than John has ever been born.He has declared the Kingdom of God on earth and is therefore above all the others.The law and the prophets were necessary till John came, but now he has announced that the Kingdom of God is on earth, and that he who makes an effort can enter into it.And some of the Orthodox came to Jesus and asked him: How and when will the Kingdom of God come?And he answered them: The Kingdom of God which I preach is not what the former prophets preached.They said that God would come with divers visible signs, but I speak of a Kingdom of God the coming of which cannot be seen with the eyes.And if anyone tells you: See, it has come, or is coming; or, See, it is here, or there; do not believe them.The Kingdom of God is not in any definite time or place.It is like lightning—here, there and everywhere.And it has neither time nor place, for the Kingdom of God that I preach is within you.Summarization models summary:

After that, one of the Orthodox, a Jewish ruler named Nicodemus, came to Jesus at night and said: You do not bid men keep Saturday, or tell them to observe cleanliness, or to offer sacrifices, or to fast, and you would abolish the temple, and say that God is a spirit and that the Kingdom of God is within us.What is this Kingdom of God?And Jesus answered him: Understand that if man is conceived from heaven there must be something heavenly in him.You must be born again.Nicodemus did not understand this, and said: How can a man, born of the flesh and grown up, return to his mother's womb and be conceived afresh?And Jesus answered him: Understand what I say: I say that man is born not from the flesh alone but also from the spirit, and so every man is conceived of flesh and of spirit, and therefore the kingdom of heaven is within him.Of the flesh he is flesh, From flesh spirit cannot be born; spirit can come only from spirit.The spirit is the living thing within you which lives in freedom and reason; it is that of which you know neither the beginning nor the end and which every man feels within him.So why do you wonder that I said that we must be born from heaven?Nicodemus said: Still I do not believe that this can be so.Then Jesus said to him: What kind of a teacher are you if you do not understand this?Understand that I am not talking any kind of mystery; I speak of what we all know, and assure you of what we all see.How will you believe in what is in heaven if you do not believe in what is on earth and within yourself?No one has ever gone up to heaven, and we have only man on earth who has come from heaven and is himself of heaven.It is this heavenly son of man that must be exalted, that all may believe in him and not perish but have heavenly life.

Not for man's destruction, but for their good, did God implant in man this son of his, like unto Himself.He gave him that everyone should believe in him and not perish but have eternal life.He did not bring this son of his (this inner life) into the world of men to destroy it, but brought forth his son (this inner life) that the world of men should live by him.He who commits his life to this son of man does not die, but he who does not commit his life to him destroys himself by not trusting to what is life itself.Division (death) consists in this, that life came into the world, but men go away from that life.Light is the life of men; light came into the world, but men prefer darkness to light, and do not go to the light.He who does wrong avoids the light that his deeds may not be seen, and so deprives himself of life.But he who lives in the truth goes to the light that his deeds may be seen, and he has life and is united to God.The Kingdom of God must be understood not as you imagine—that the Kingdom of God will come for all men at a certain time and in a certain place—but thus: in the whole world there are always some people who rely on the heavenly son of man, and these become sons of the Kingdom; the others who do not rely on him perish.The Father of the spirit in man is the Father of those only who acknowledge themselves as his sons.And therefore only those exist to him who have preserved within them what he gave them.After this Jesus began to explain to the people what the Kingdom of God is, and he taught it them by parables.He said: The Father—who is the spirit—sows the life of understanding in the world as a husbandman sows grain in his field.He sows over the whole field without remarking which seeds fall in what place.Summarization models summary:

And some seeds fall on the path and the birds come and eat it.Other seeds fall among stones and though they come up they wither, because there is no room for their roots.Others again fall among wormwood and the wormwood chokes them, and though ears form they do not fill.But other seeds fall on good ground and grow and make up for the lost seed, and bear ears which fill, and which yield thirtyfold, or sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.So God also has sown the spirit broadcast in man: in some it is lost but in others it yields a hundredfold.It is these last that form the Kingdom of God.So the Kingdom of God is not what you imagine—that God will come to reign over you.God has sown the spirit, and the Kingdom of God will be only in those who preserve it.God does not force men but, like a sower, casts seed on the ground and thinks no more of it.The seed itself swells, sprouts, puts forth leaf, stalk, and ears that fill with grain.Only when it has ripened does the husbandman send reapers to gather in the harvest.In the same way God gave His Son—the spirit—to the world; and the spirit grows in the world of itself, and the sons of the spirit make up the Kingdom of God.A woman puts yeast into a kneading trough and mixes it with flour.She then mixes it no more but lets the yeast and the bread rise.As long as people live God does not interfere with their life.He gave the spirit to the world and the spirit lives in men, and those who live by the spirit constitute the Kingdom of God.For the spirit there is neither death nor evil.Death and evil exist for the flesh but not for the spirit.The Kingdom of God may be compared to this: a farmer sowed good seed in his field.

The farmer is the spirit, the Father; the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the Kingdom of God.Then the farmer lay down to sleep and an enemy came and sowed darnel in the field.The enemy is temptation, and the darnel represents those who yield to temptation.Then the laborers came to the farmer and said: Can you have sown bad seed?Much darnel has come up on your field.Send us to weed it out.And the farmer said: No, do not do that, or in weeding out the darnel you will trample the wheat.Let them grow together.When the harvest comes I will tell the reapers to gather the darnel and burn it, but the wheat I will store in the barn.The harvest is the end of human life, the harvesters are the powers of heaven.They will burn the darnel, but the wheat will be winnowed and gathered.So also at life's end all that was temporary illusion will perish, and the true life of the spirit will alone be left.Evil does not exist for the Father, the spirit.The spirit keeps what it needs and what is not of it does not exist for it.The kingdom of heaven is like a net.When spread out in the sea it catches all kinds of fish, and when it is drawn in, the worthless fish are set aside and thrown back into the sea.So will it be at the end of the age: the powers of heaven will take the good and the evil will be cast away.And when he had finished speaking, his pupils asked him what these parables meant.And he said to them: These parables must be understood in two ways.I speak all these parables because there are some like you, my pupils, who understand what the Kingdom of God consists of, and understand that it is within each man, and understand how to enter it; but others do not understand this.Summarization models summary:

Therefore the will of the Father is the life and welfare of all men.'thy kingdom come'JESUS went about in the towns and villages and taught all men the happiness of doing the Father's will.And he was sorry for people because they perish without knowing what true life consists of, and trouble and torment themselves without knowing why, like scattered sheep that have no shepherd.Once many people came to Jesus to hear his teaching and he went up on a hill and sat down.His pupils surrounded him.And he began to teach the people what the Father's will is.He said:Blessed are the poor and the homeless, for they live in the will of the Father.If they are hungry they shall be satisfied, and if they sorrow and weep they shall be comforted.If people despise them, thrust them aside, and drive them away, let them be glad of it, for so God's people have always been treated and they receive a heavenly reward.But woe to the rich, for they have already got what they wanted, and will get nothing more.Now they are satisfied, but they too will be hungry.Now they rejoice, but they too will be sad.Woe to those whom everyone praises, for only deceivers are praised by everybody.Blessed are the poor and homeless; but blessed only if they are poor not merely outwardly but also in spirit—just as salt is good only when it has saltness in it and is not salt merely in appearance.So you also, the poor and homeless, are the teachers of the world; you are blessed if you know that true happiness is in being homeless and poor.But if you are poor only outwardly then, like salt that has no savour, you are good for nothing.You are the light of the world, therefore do not hide your light but let men see it.Summarization models summary:

When a man lights a candle he does not put it under the bench but on the table that it should give light to everyone in the room.So you, too, should not hide your light but show it by your actions, that men may see that you have the truth, and seeing your good deeds may understand your heavenly Father.And do not think that I free you from the law.I teach not release from the law but fulfilment of the eternal law.As long as there are men under heaven the eternal law remains.There will be no release from law till men of themselves fulfil the eternal law completely.And now I give you the commandments of that eternal law.If anyone releases himself from any of these short commandments and teaches others that they may do so, he shall be least in the kingdom of heaven, but he who fulfils them and thereby teaches others to fulfil them shall be great in the kingdom of heaven.For if your virtue is no more than the virtue of the Orthodox legalists you will never reach the kingdom of heaven.These are the commandments:In the former law it was said: Do not kill, and if anyone kills another he must be judged.But I tell you that everyone who grows angry with his brother-man deserves judgment, and still more to blame is he who speaks abusively to his brother-man.So if you wish to pray to God, first think whether there is anyone who has something against you.If you remember even one man who considers that you have offended him, leave your prayers and go first to make peace with your brother-man, and then you may pray.Know that God requires neither sacrifice nor prayer, but only peace, concord, and love among men; and that you can neither pray nor think of God if there is a single man towards whom you do not feel love.

So this is the first commandment: Do not be angry, and do not rail; and if you have spoken harshly to anyone make peace with him and do it so that no one should have a grudge against you.In the former law it was said: Do not commit adultery, and if you wish to put away your wife, give her a letter of divorcement.But I tell you that if you look lustfully at a woman's beauty you are already committing adultery.All sensuality destroys the soul, and so it is better for you to renounce the pleasures of the flesh than to destroy your life.And if you put away your wife, then besides being vicious yourself you drive her to wantonness too, as well as him with whom she may unite.So that is the second commandment: Do not think that love of a woman is good, do not desire women, but live with her with whom you have become united, and do not leave her.In the former law it was said: Do not utter the name of the Lord God in vain, do not call upon God when lying, and do not dishonour the name of your God.Do not swear to any untruth and so profane your God.But I tell you that every oath is a profanation of God.Therefore do not swear at all.Man cannot promise anything, for he is wholly in the power of the Father.He cannot make one grey hair black.How then can he swear beforehand that he will do this or that, and swear to it by God?Every oath is a profanation of God, for if a man is compelled to fulfil under an oath that which is against the will of God it shows that he had promised to act contrary to God's will, and so every oath is an evil.But when men ask you about anything, say Yes if it is yes, or No if it is no; anything added to that is evil.Summarization models summary:

So the third commandment is: Never swear anything for anyone.Say Yes when it is yes, No when it is no, and understand that every oath is evil.In the former law it was said that if a man killed another he must give a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, an arm for an arm, an ox for an ox, a slave for a slave, and much else.But I say to you: Do not fight evil by evil, and not only do not exact at law an ox for an ox, a slave for a slave, a life for a life, but do not resist evil at all.If anyone wishes to take an ox from you, give him another; if he wants to take your coat by law, give him your shirt as well; if anyone knocks out a tooth on one side, turn the other side to him.If he would make you do one piece of work for him, do two.If men wish to take your property, let them have it.If they owe you money and do not return it, do not demand it.And therefore: Do not judge or go to law, do not punish, and you yourself will not be judged or punished.Forgive everyone and you will be forgiven; but if you judge others they will judge you also.You cannot judge, for men are all blind and do not see the truth.How can you see a speck in your brother's eye when there is dust in your own?You must first get your own eye clear—but whose eyes are perfectly clear?Can a blind man lead the blind?They will both fall into the pit.And those who judge and punish are like blind men leading the blind.Those who judge, and condemn others to violent treatment, wounds, mutilation, or death, wish to correct them, but what can come of their teaching except that the pupils will learn to become just like their teacher?

What then will they do when they have learnt the lesson?Only what their teacher does: violence and murder.And do not expect to find justice in the courts.To entrust one's love of justice to men's courts is like throwing precious pearls to swine: they will trample on them and will tear you to pieces.And therefore the fourth commandment is: However men may wrong you, do not return evil, do not judge or go to law, do not sue, and do not punish.In the former law it was said: Do good to men of your own nation and do harm to foreigners.But I tell you: Love not only your own countrymen, but people of other nations also.Let others hate you, attack you, and wrong you, but speak well of them and do good to them.If you are attached only to your own countrymen, remember that all men are attached to their own countrymen, and wars result from that.But behave equally well to men of all nations, and you will be sons of the Father.All men are His children, so they are all brothers to you.And so this is the fifth commandment: Treat foreigners as I have told you to treat one another.To the Father of all men there are no separate nations or separate kingdoms: all are brothers, all sons of one Father.Make no distinctions among people as to nations and kingdoms.And so: (1) Do not be angry, but live at peace with all men.(2) Do not indulge yourself in sexual gratification.(3) Do not promise anything on oath to anyone.(4) Do not resist evil, do not judge and do not go to law.(5) Make no distinction of nationality, but love foreigners as your own people.All these commandments are contained in one: All that you wish men to do to you, do you to them.Do not fulfil these commandments for praise from men.Summarization models summary:

If you do it for men, then from men you have your reward.But if you do it not for men, your reward is from your heavenly Father.So if you do good to others do not boast about it before men.That is what the hypocrites do, to obtain praise.And they get what they seek.But if you do good to men, do it so that no one sees it, and that your left hand should not know what your right hand does.And your Father will see it and will give you what you need.And if you wish to pray, do not do it as the hypocrites do.They love to pray in the churches and in the sight of men.They do it for men's praise, and from men receive what they aim at.But if you wish to pray, go where no one will see you, and pray to the Father of your spirit, and He will see what is in your soul and will give you what your soul desires.When you pray, do not wag your tongue as the hypocrites do.Your Father knows what you need before you open your lips.Pray only thus:Our Father, without beginning and without end, like the heavens!May Thy being alone be holy.May power be Thine alone, so that Thy will may be done, without beginning and without end, on earth.Give me the food of life this present day.Efface my former mistakes and wipe them out, as I efface and wipe out all the mistakes my brothers have made; that I may not fall into temptation, but be saved from evil.For the power and strength are Thine, and the decision is Thine.If you pray, free yourself above all from malice against anyone.For if you do not forgive others their faults, your Father will not forgive you yours.If you fast, do so without any parade of it before others.

The hypocrites fast that people should see it and praise them—and people do praise them, so they get what they wanted.But you should not do so; if you suffer want, go about with a cheerful face that men may not see, but that your Father may see and give you what you need.Do not lay up store for yourself on earth.On earth maggots consume, and rust eats, and thieves steal: but lay up for yourselves heavenly riches.Heavenly riches are not consumed by maggots, nor eaten away by rust, nor do thieves steal them.Where your riches are, there will your heart be also.The light of the body is the eye, and the light of the soul is the heart.If your eye is dim your whole body will be in darkness.And if the light of your heart is dim your whole soul will be in darkness.You cannot serve two masters at the same time.If you please the one you will offend the other.You cannot serve both God and the flesh.Either you will work for the earthly life or for God.Therefore do not be anxious about what you will eat or drink, or how you will be dressed.For the life is more wonderful than food and clothing and God has given you this.Look on God's creatures, the birds.They do not sow or reap or gather in the harvest, yet God feeds them.In God's sight man is not less than a bird.If God gave man life, He will be able to feed him too.And you yourselves know that you can do nothing of yourselves, however you may strive.You cannot lengthen your life by an hour.And why do you trouble about clothing?The flowers of the field do no work and do not spin, but they are adorned as Solomon in all his luxury never was.And if God has so adorned the grass which grows to-day, and to-morrow is cut down, will He not clothe you?Summarization models summary:

Do not be afraid and do not worry; do not say that you must think of what you will eat and how you will be clothed.All men need these things and God knows that you need them.So do not trouble about the future.Live in the present day.Take care to be in the Father's will.Desire that which alone is important, and the rest will come of itself.Seek only to be in the will of the Father, and do not trouble about the future, for when it comes its trouble will come too.There is enough evil in the present.Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it will be opened to you.Where is there a father who would give his son a stone instead of bread, or a snake instead of a fish?Then why do you think if we wicked men can give our children what they need, that your Father in heaven will not give you what you truly need, if you ask Him?Ask, and the heavenly Father will give the spirit of life to them that ask Him.Narrow is the path to life, but enter by that narrow way.There is only one entry to life—a strait and narrow one.Great and wide is the field around, but it leads to destruction.The narrow way alone leads to life, and few find it.But do not be afraid, little flock!The Father has prepared the Kingdom for you.Only, beware of false prophets and teachers; they come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.By their fruits—by what comes from them—you will know them.From the burdock you do not gather grapes, nor apples from an aspen.A good tree bears good fruit and a bad tree bad fruit.So you will know these men by the fruits of their teaching.A good man out of his good heart brings forth all that is good.

But an evil man out of his evil heart brings forth all that is evil.For from the overflow of the heart the lips speak.And therefore if teachers tell you to do to others what would be bad for yourselves, if they teach violence, executions, and wars—then you may know that they are false teachers.For it is not those who say: 'Lord, Lord!'who will enter the kingdom of heaven, but those who fulfil the will of the heavenly Father.The false teachers will say: 'Lord, Lord!We taught your doctrine, and by your teaching drove out evil.'But I will disown them and say: 'No, I never recognized you and do not recognize you now, Go away from me; you do what is unlawful.'He who hears these words of mine and acts on them is like a reasonable man who builds his house on a rock.And his house will stand against all storms.But he who hears these words of mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who builds his house on the sand.When a storm comes his house will fall and all in it will perish.And the people were all astonished at this teaching, for the teaching of Jesus was quite different from that of the Orthodox professors of the law.They taught a law that had to be obeyed, but Jesus taught that all men are free.And in Jesus Christ were fulfilled the prophecies of Isaiah: that a people living in darkness, in the shadow of death, saw the light of life.That he who brought this light of truth did no violence or harm to men, but was meek and gentle.To bring truth into the world he neither disputes nor shouts, nor is his voice raised, and he will not break a straw or put out the smallest light, and all the hope of men is in his teaching.THE TRUE LIFE

AND Jesus rejoiced in the power of the spirit and said:I acknowledge the spirit of the Father, the source of everything in heaven and earth, who has revealed what was hidden from the wise and learned to the simple, because they acknowledge themselves sons of the Father.All who are concerned for the happiness of the body have put on a yoke not made for them, and have harnessed themselves to a load they cannot draw.Understand my teaching and follow it and you shall have peace and joy in life.I give you another yoke and another load—the spiritual life.Yoke yourselves to this, and you shall learn from me peace and happiness.Be tranquil and meek-hearted and you will find blessedness in your life.For my teaching is a yoke made for you, and to obey my teaching is to have a light load with a yoke suited to you.Once when he was asked whether he wished to eat, he replied: I have food you do not know of.They thought someone had brought him food, but he said:My food is to do the will of Him who gave me life and to accomplish what he has entrusted to me.Do not say: There is still time, as a farmer says while waiting for the harvest.He who fulfils the will of the Father is always satisfied and knows neither hunger nor thirst.The fulfilment of the will of God always satisfies and is always a reward in itself.You must not say: 'I will do the will of God later.'While you have life you always can and should do the will of the Father.Our life is a field God has sown, and our business is to gather its fruits.If we gather its fruits we receive the reward of a life beyond time.We do not give ourselves life, someone else gives it us.And if we labour to gather in life, then like harvestmen, we receive a reward.I teach you to gather in this life which the Father gives you.

Once Jesus went to Jerusalem.There was then a bathing-place in the city, of which people said that an angel came, down into it, and that his coming stirred the water and he who first plunged in after that would be cured of whatever illness he had.There were shelters set up around the pool, and under those shelters sick people lay, waiting for the water in the pool to bubble, in order to plunge into it.And there was a man who had been there thirty-eight years, and was weak.Jesus asked him what ailed him.And the man told him that he had been ill for thirty-eight years and was waiting to get into the pool first after the water bubbled, in order to be healed, but all these thirty-eight years he had not been able to get in first for someone always got into the pool before him.And Jesus saw that the man was old, and said to him: Do you wish to get well?The man replied: Yes, I do wish to, but I have no one to help me into the pool in time.Someone always gets in before me.And Jesus said to him: Arouse yourself, take up your bedding and go.And the sick man took up his bedding and walked away.And it was on a Saturday.And the Orthodox said: You must not carry your bedding for to-day is Saturday.He replied: He who raised me told me to take up my bedding.And the infirm man went away and told the Orthodox that it was Jesus who had cured him.And they were angry, and accused Jesus because he did such things on Saturday.And Jesus said: What the Father always does, I also do.I tell you truly: the son can do nothing for himself; he does only what he has understood from the Father.What the Father does, he also does.The Father loves the son, and has taught him all the things the son needs to know.Summarization models summary:

As the Father gives life to the dead so the son gives life to him who desires it, because as the business of the Father is life so the business of the son must be life.The Father has not condemned men to death, but has given them power to die or live at will.And if they honour the son as the Father they will live.I tell you truly that he who has understood my teaching and believed in the common Father of all men, has life already and is delivered from death.They who have understood the meaning of human life have already escaped from death and will always live.For as the Father has life in Himself so He has given the son to have life in himself also, and has given him freedom.It is in this way that he is the son of man.Henceforth mortals are divided into two kinds: those who do good and thereby find life, and those who do evil and are thereby destroyed.And this is not my decision, but is what I have understood from the Father.And my decision is just, for I decide so not in order to do what I wish, but in order that all may do the will of the Father of all men.If I assure you that my teaching is true, that does not confirm my teaching; what confirms it is the conduct I teach.That shows that I do not teach from myself but from the Father of all men.And my Father, He who has taught me, confirms the truth of my commandments in the souls of all.But you do not wish to understand or to know His voice.And you do not accept the meaning that voice declares.You do not wish to believe in that voice in yourselves which is the spirit that has descended from heaven.Enter into the meaning of your scriptures.You will find in them the same as in my teaching: commands to live not for yourselves alone but to do good to men.Why then do you not wish to believe my commandments—which are those that give life to all men?

I teach you in the name of the common Father of all men, and you do not accept my teaching, but if someone teaches you in his own name, him you believe.You should not believe all that people say to one another, but must believe only that there is in every man a son like the Father.And that men should not think that the kingdom of heaven is something visible—but should understand that it consists in fulfilment of the Father's will and that that fulfilment depends on each man's efforts—and that people might understand that life is given not for oneself personally but only for the fulfilment of the Father's will, which alone saves us from death and gives life, Jesus spoke a parable, and said:There was a rich man who had to leave home.Before he set out he called his slaves and gave them ten pounds, one to each, and said: While I am away, work each of you, at what I have set you.And it happened that when he had gone, some of the people of that town said: We do not wish to serve him any more.When the rich man returned, he called the slaves to whom he had given the money, and asked what each of them had done with it.The first one came and said: See, master, with your one pound I have earned ten.And the master said to him: Well done, good slave, you have been faithful in a small matter and I will set you over much: be one with me in all my estate.A second slave came and said: See master, with your pound I have earned five.And the master said to him: Well done, good slave, be one with me in all my estate.Another one came and said: See, here is your pound.I put it in a cloth and buried it because I was afraid of you.You are a hard man, you take where you did not store and gather where you did not sow.Summarization models summary:

And the master said to him: Foolish slave!I will judge you by your own words.You say that from fear of me you hid the pound in the earth and did not make use of it.If you knew that I am severe and take where I have not given, then why did you not do as I bade you?If you had used my pound the estate would have been added to and you would have fulfilled what I bade you.But now you have not done what the pound was given you for, and so you must not have it.And the master had the pound taken from him who had not used it and given to him who had done most.But the slaves remonstrated, and said to him: Master, he has a great deal already.But the master said: Give to him who worked much, for to him who looks after what he has, more shall be given.Drive out those who did not wish to be in my power, and let none of them remain.The master is the source of life, the spirit, the Father.His slaves are men.The pounds are the life of the spirit.As the master did not work on his estate himself but told the slaves each to work by himself, so also the spirit of life in men has told them to work for the life of all men, and has then left them alone.Those who sent to say that they did not acknowledge the master's power are those who do not acknowledge the spirit of life.The return of the master and his call for an account is the destruction of the bodily life and the decision of the people's fate: whether they have increased the life that was given them.Some, those slaves who fulfil the master's will, use what is given them and greatly increase it.These are they who, having received life, understand that life is the will of the Father and is given them to serve the life of others.

The foolish and wicked slave who hid his pound and did not use it, represents those who only follow their own desires and not the will of the Father, and do not serve the life of others.The slaves who fulfil the Master's will and work to increase his estate become sharers in the master's whole estate, but the slaves who do not fulfil the master's will and do not work for him are bereft of what was given them.Men who fulfil the Father's will and serve life become sharers in the life of the Father and receive more life notwithstanding the destruction of the flesh.Those who do not fulfil the will and do not serve life are bereft of what life they had, and are destroyed.Those who do not wish to acknowledge the master's authority do not exist for him: he drives them forth.Those who do not acknowledge the life of the spirit within themselves—the life of the son of man—do not exist for the Father.After this Jesus went into a desert place and many people followed him.He went up a hill and sat down there with his pupils.And he saw many people coming and said: Where can we get bread for all these people?Philip said: Even two hundred pennyworth would not be enough to give each of them something.We have only a little bread and fish.And another pupil said: Some of them have bread: there is a boy who has five loaves and two small fishes.And Jesus said: Tell them all to lie down on the grass.And Jesus took the bread he had, and gave it to his pupils and bade them give it to the other people.And so they all began to give to one another what they had, and they all had enough to eat and much was left over.Next day the people again came to Jesus, and he said to them: You come to me not because you have seen wonders, but because you ate bread and were satisfied.Summarization models summary: 
The master threatened to judge the slave who hid a pound in the earth and did not use it.
The slave was accused of hiding the pound because he was afraid of the master's wrath.
Upon the slave's refusal to use the pound, the master gave it to the one who had done the most work and increased his estate.
Some of the slaves who worked hard and increased the estate were given the pound by the master.
In this scenario, the spirit of life in men is the source of the pounds and the pounds are the life of the spirit.
Those who do not acknowledge the spirit's authority are those who don't acknowledge the power of life and work for the lives of others.

Do not work for food which perishes, but for food which will last for ever, such as only the spirit of the son of man, sealed by the Father, gives you.The Jews said: What must we do to fulfil the will of God?And Jesus said: The work of God consists in believing in the life He has given you.They said: Give us proofs that we may believe.What do you do?Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness.God gave them food to eat, so it is written.Jesus answered them: The true heavenly bread is the spirit of the son of man, which the Father gives.For the food of man is the spirit that descends from heaven.It is that which gives life to the world.My teaching gives true nourishment.He who follows me will not hunger, and he who believes in my teaching will never know thirst.But I have already told you that you have seen this and yet do not believe.All that life which the Father has given to the son will be realized by my teaching, and everyone who believes in it will share that life.For I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the Father who gave me life.And the will of the Father who sent me is that I should keep all the life He gave and not lose any of it.So it is the will of the Father who sent me, that everyone who sees the son and believes in him should have everlasting life.And my teaching gives life at the last day (of the flesh).The Jews were disturbed at his saying that his teaching had come down from heaven.They said: Why, this is Jesus the son of Joseph: we know his father and mother.How is it that he says his teaching has come down from heaven?And Jesus said: Do not discuss who I am and where I came from.

My teaching is true, not because, like Moses, I declare that God spoke to me on Sinai, but because it exists in you too.Everyone who believes my commandments does so not because it is I who speak, but because our common Father draws him to Himself; and my teaching will give him life at the last day.It is written in the prophets that all men shall be taught of God.Everyone who understands the Father, and learns to know His will, yields himself to my teaching.No one has ever seen the Father, but he that is of God has seen and sees Him.He who believes in me (in my teaching) has everlasting life.My teaching is the food of life.Your fathers ate manna, food sent from heaven, and yet died.But the true food of life which descends from heaven is such that he who feeds on it will not die.And my teaching is this food of life that has descended from heaven.He who feeds on it lives for ever.And this food which I teach is my body which I give for the life of mankind.The Jews did not at all understand what he said, and began to dispute as to how it was possible to give one's body for the life of men, and why.And Jesus said to them: If you do not give your body for the life of the spirit there will be no life in you.He who does not give his body for the life of the spirit has no real life.Only that in me which gives up the body for the spirit has real life.And therefore our bodies are truly food for the real life.Only that in me which consumes my body, that which gives up the bodily life for the true life—is really I—it is in me, and I am in it.And as I live in the body by the will of the Father, so that which lives in me lives by my will.Summarization models summary:

And some of his pupils when they heard this, said: These are hard words, and it is difficult to understand them.And Jesus said to them: Your minds are so confused, that my saying about what man was, is, and always will be, seems to you difficult.Man is a spirit in the flesh, and the spirit alone gives life—the flesh does not give life.In the words that seem to you so difficult I said no more than that the spirit is life.Afterwards Jesus chose seventy men from among those near him, and sent them to places he himself wished to go to.He said to them: Many men do not know the blessing of real life.I am sorry for them all, and wish to teach them.But as a husbandman cannot himself reap his whole harvest, so I, too, cannot do all that is needed.Go you to different towns and proclaim everywhere the fulfilment of the will of the Father.Say: The will of the Father is this: not to be angry, not to lust, not to take oaths, not to resist evil, and not to make any distinction between people.And accordingly fulfil these laws yourselves in everything.I send you like sheep among wolves.Be wise as serpents and pure as doves.Above all, have nothing of your own; take nothing with you, neither wallet, nor bread, nor money, only the clothes you wear and shoes.Make no distinction between people; do not choose out the people with whom you will stay.But stay in whatever house you first come to.When you enter a house, greet the master.If he take you in, stay there; if not, go to another house.For what you will say they will hate you and fall upon you and drive you away.But when you are driven out go to another village, and if you are driven from there, go to yet another.

You will be pursued as wolves pursue sheep, but do not be afraid, endure to the last hour.They will take you to the Courts and try you, and will flog you and take you before the authorities for you to justify yourselves before them.But do not be afraid when you are taken to the Courts, and do not prepare what you will say: the spirit of the Father in you will tell you what to say.Before you have passed through all the towns some people will understand your teaching and turn to it.So be not afraid.What is hidden in men's souls will come forth.What you will say to two or three will spread among thousands.Above all, do not be afraid of those who can kill your body.They can do nothing to your souls, so fear them not.Fear rather that which can destroy both body and soul by the non-fulfilment of the Father's will—fear that.Five sparrows are sold for a farthing, but even they do not die without the Father's will.And no hair falls from the head without the Father's will.So what have you to fear if you live in that will?Not everyone will believe in my teaching.And those who do not believe will hate it because it deprives them of what they love.So dissensions will come from my teaching.It will kindle the world like a fire, and from it strife must arise.There will be dissension in every house, father against son, mother against daughter.Families will hate those members who understand my teaching, and will kill them.For to him who understands my teaching there will be no meaning in 'father', or 'mother', or 'wife', or 'children', or 'property'.Then the learned Orthodox gathered at Jerusalem and went to Jesus who was in a village near by.A crowd of people had thronged into the house where he was and stood around it.Summarization models summary:

The Orthodox began to speak to the people, telling them not to listen to the teaching of Jesus.They said that he was possessed of a devil, and that if men lived by his commandments there would be still more evil in the world than now.They said that he drove out evil by evil means.Jesus called them to him and said: You say that I drive out evil by evil.But no power destroys itself.If it destroyed itself it would cease to exist.You try to drive out evil by threats, executions, and murders, but evil still exists precisely because it cannot fight against itself.I do not drive out evil by evil as you try to.I drive out evil by calling on men to fulfil the will of the Father's spirit which gives life to all men.Five commandments express the will of that spirit, which gives happiness and life.And they therefore destroy evil.That is a proof that they are true.If men were not sons of one spirit it would not be possible to overcome evil, just as it is not possible to enter a strong man's house and rob it.To rob his house it is necessary first to bind the strong man.And men are bound by their unity in the spirit of life.And so I say to you that all mistakes of men and every false opinion shall escape punishment, but false interpretations of the holy spirit, which gives life to all, will not be forgiven.If anyone speaks ill of a man it may not be counted against him, but if anyone speaks against the holy spirit in man, that cannot pass without harm to him.Abuse me as much as you like, but do not decry the commandments of life I have disclosed to you.It cannot pass harmlessly for a man if he calls what is good—evil.Man must be at one with the spirit of life.He who is not at one with it is against it.Man must serve the spirit of life and goodness in all men, and not in himself alone.

Either you believe life and happiness to be good for the whole world, and should then love life and happiness for all men, or you believe life and happiness to be evil, and should then not love them even for yourself.Either you consider a tree good and its fruit good, or else you consider the tree bad and its fruit bad.For a tree is valued by its fruit.THE FALSE LIFE

But the man replied: I have a father who is old; let me first bury him and then I will follow you.And Jesus said to him: Let the dead bury the dead, but if you wish really to live fulfil the Father's will and publish it.Another man said: I wish to be your pupil and will fulfil the Father's will as you command, but let me first arrange my family affairs.And Jesus said to him: If a ploughman looks back he cannot plough.As long as you look back you cannot plough.You must forget everything except the furrow you are driving and only then can you plough.If you consider what may befall your bodily life you cannot live, because you have not understood the real life.After this it happened that Jesus went with his pupils into a village, and a woman named Martha asked him into her house.She had a sister, Mary, who sat at Jesus' feet and listened to his teaching, while Martha was busy preparing a good meal for them.And Martha went up to Jesus and said: Do you not see that my sister leaves me to do all the work?Tell her to help me with it.In reply Jesus said to her: Martha, Martha!You busy yourself and are anxious about many things, but only one thing is needful; Mary has chosen that one necessary thing which no one shall take from her.The one thing needful for life is food for the soul.And Jesus said to them all:He who wishes to follow me, let him put aside his own will and be ready to endure all hardships and sufferings of the flesh throughout his life; only then can he follow me.He who wishes to take heed for his bodily life will destroy his true life, but he who obeys the will of the Father, even though he may destroy his bodily life, will save his true life.And what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world but destroys or harms his true life?

And he said: Beware of riches, for your life does not depend on possessing more than others.There was once a rich man who had a large harvest.And he thought to himself, I will rebuild my barns and put up larger ones and gather all my wealth into them, and I will say to my soul: There, my soul, you have all you desire; rest, eat, drink, and live for your pleasure.But God said to him: Foolish man, to-night your soul will be taken and all that you have stored up will go to others.So it is with everyone who provides for his bodily life and does not live in God.And Jesus said to them: You tell me that Pilate slew the Galileans.Were those Galileans any worse than others, that this happened to them?Not at all.We are all such, and we also shall all perish unless we find salvation from death.Or were those eighteen men who were crushed by a falling tower, worse than all the other people of Jerusalem?Not at all.If we do not save ourselves from death, to-day or to-morrow we too shall perish.If we have not yet perished as they did, we must think of our position thus:A man had an apple-tree in his garden and he came and looked at the tree and saw there was no fruit on it.And he said to the gardener: This is the third year I have been here and found that apple-tree always barren.It must be cut down, for it only takes up space uselessly.But the gardener said: Let us wait awhile, master.I will dig round it, manure it, and we will see next summer.Perhaps it will bear fruit, but if not, then cut it down.So we, too, while we live in the flesh and do not bear fruit of the life of the spirit, are barren apple-trees.Only by someone's mercy are we left for another year.Summarization models summary:

But if we do not bear fruit we too shall perish—like him who rebuilt his barns, like the Galileans, like the eighteen men crushed by the falling tower, and like all who do not bear fruit—perishing and dying for ever.To understand this no wisdom is necessary; everyone can see it for himself.Not only in domestic affairs but in all that goes on in the world we can reason and guess what is coming.If the wind is from the west, we say: It will rain—and so it happens.But if there is wind from the south, we say: It will be fine—and so it happens.How is it that we can tell the weather, but cannot foresee that we shall all die and perish, and that the only salvation for us is in the life of the spirit—in the fulfilment of its will?And many people followed Jesus, and he again said to them all:He who would be my follower, let him put out of mind his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and all his property, and let him at all times be ready for anything.Only he who does what I do and follows my teaching can save himself from death.For every man before beginning anything considers whether what he would do is profitable; if it seems profitable he does it, but if it seems unprofitable he will abandon it.Every man who builds a house first sits down and reckons how much it will cost, how much he has, and whether he can finish it; that it may not happen that having, begun to build he should be unable to finish, and so be laughed at.So also he who wishes to live the life of the flesh should first consider how he can finish what he is engaged on.Every king who wishes to go to war will first consider whether he can go against twenty thousand men with only ten thousand.If he sees that he cannot, he will send an ambassador to make peace, and will not go to war.

So let every man, before giving himself to the life of the flesh, bethink himself whether he can resist death or whether death is stronger than he, and whether he had not better make peace at once.Each of you should first reckon all that he considers his own: family, money, and property.When he has considered what all this avails him, and understands that it avails him nothing, only then can he be my follower.And hearing this, a man said: That is well if there be a life of the spirit.But what if we give up everything and there is no such life?To that Jesus replied: Not so.Everyone knows the life of the spirit.You all know it.You do not practice what you know, not because you doubt, but because you are diverted from the true life by false cares and excuse yourself from it.This is like what you do: A master prepared a dinner and sent to invite guests, but they began to decline.One said: I have bought some land and must go to see it.Another said: I have bought some oxen and must try them.A third said: I have married and must give a wedding feast.And the servants came and told the master that no one would come.Then the master sent his servants to call in the poor, and they did not refuse but came.And when they had come there was still room to spare, so the master sent to call in others, saying: Go and persuade everyone you meet to come to my dinner, that there may be still more guests.But those who refused because they were busy missed the dinner.All men know that the fulfilment of the will of the Father gives life, but they do not accept his invitation because they are drawn away by the guile of riches.He who gives up false transitory riches for true life in accord with the Father's will, acts as a clever steward did.There was a steward to a rich master.Summarization models summary:

This steward saw that his master would soon dismiss him and he would be left without food or shelter.And he thought to himself: This is what I will do.I will secretly give away some of my master's goods to the peasants and reduce their debts, and then if my master sends me away the peasants will remember my kindness and will help me.And he did so.He called the peasants who were in debt to his master, and re-wrote their quittances.For him who owed a hundred he made it fifty; instead of sixty he put down twenty, and for the others in the same way.When the master heard of this he said to himself: My steward has acted cleverly, for he saw he would have been left with nothing.He has caused me loss, but he has acted cleverly for himself.For in the bodily life we all understand what is advantageous, but in regard to the life of the spirit we do not wish to understand.We should give away the transitory and false riches of this life in order to obtain the life of the spirit.If we grudge such trifles as riches for the life of the spirit, we shall not receive it.If we do not give up the false life our true life will not be given us.It is not possible to serve two masters at once—God and riches: the will of the Father and your own will.You must serve either the one or the other.The Orthodox heard this, and as they loved wealth they ridiculed him.But he said to them: You think that because you are honoured by men for your wealth you are really honourable.It is not so.God does not look at the exterior, but at the heart.That which is esteemed among men is despicable in God's sight.Even now the Kingdom of God is attainable on earth, and they who enter it are great.And it is not the rich who enter that kingdom, but those who have nothing.

This always was so, and is so by your law and by Moses and the prophets.Listen how the rich the and poor stand, even in your belief:There was a rich man, who dressed in fine clothes and went to amuse himself and to make merry every day.And there was a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, who came to the rich man's yard to see if some scraps might not be left over from the rich man's feast; but Lazarus did not get even these, the rich man's dogs ate them all up and even licked Lazarus's sores.And both Lazarus and the rich man died.And when in hell the rich man saw Abraham afar off, and the beggar Lazarus sitting with him.And the rich man cried: Father Abraham, Lazarus the beggar is sitting with you, who used to lie outside my fence.I dare not trouble you; but send Lazarus the beggar to me: let him but dip his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am burning in the fire.But Abraham said: Why should I send Lazarus into the fire to you?In the world you had what you wished, but Lazarus only had sorrow, so now he must be comforted.And even though I might like to do it, I cannot send him to you, for there is a great gulf between us and you which cannot be crossed.We are living and you are dead.Then the rich man said: Well, Father Abraham, at least send Lazarus to my house.I have five brothers and am sorry for them.Let him tell them everything, and show them how harmful riches are, or they too may fall into this torment.But Abraham said: They know already that it is harmful.Moses and all the prophets have told them so.But the rich man said: Still, it would be better if someone were to rise from the dead and go to them, they would then bethink themselves.Summarization models summary:

But Abraham said: If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they would not listen even to one who rose from the dead.That a man ought to share with his brother and do good to all men, is known to everyone.The whole law of Moses and the prophets only says that.You know it, but because you love riches you cannot obey it.And a rich Orthodox official came to Jesus and said to him: You are a good teacher.What must I do to obtain everlasting life?Jesus said to him: Why do you call me good?Only the Father is good.If you wish to have life, fulfil the commandments.The official said: There are many commandments—which must I fulfil?And Jesus said: Do not kill, do not lust, do not lie, do not steal.Also, honour your Father and fulfil his will, and love your neighbor as yourself.And the Orthodox official said: I have kept all those commandments since I was a child; but I ask what else must I do according to your teaching?Jesus looked at him and at his rich clothes, smiled, and said: One little thing you have not yet done.You have not fulfilled everything, as you say.If you wish to fulfil the commandments: not to kill, not to lust, not to steal, not to lie, and the chief command, to love your neighbor as yourself—then sell all your possessions at once and give to the poor.Then you will fulfil the Father's will.Hearing this, the official frowned and went away, for he was loth to part with his possessions.And Jesus said to his pupils: As you see, it is quite impossible to be rich and to fulfil the Father's will.The pupils were horrified at these words, but Jesus repeated them again, and said: Yes, children, it is impossible for him who has riches to be in the Father's will.

A camel can pass through the eye of a needle sooner than he who trusts in riches fulfil the will of the Father.And they were still more horrified and said: How then can one preserve one's life?But he said: To a man it seems that he cannot support his life without property, but God preserves a man's life without property.Jesus was once passing through the town of Jericho.And a prominent tax-farmer was there, a rich man named Zacchaeus, who had heard of Jesus' teaching and believed in it, and when he learnt that Jesus was in Jericho he wished to see him.But there was such a crowd round Jesus that it was impossible to push through to him.Zacchaeus was a small man, so he ran ahead and climbed a tree that he might see Jesus as he went past.When passing the tree Jesus saw him, and knowing that he believed in his teaching said: Come down from the tree and go home.I will come to you.Zacchaeus climbed down, ran home, made ready to welcome Jesus, and received him joyfully.The people disapproved of this and said of Jesus: Why, he has gone to a taxfarmer's—to a scoundrel's house!At that very time Zacchaeus was saying to Jesus: See, Master, what I will do: I will give half my property to the poor, and out of what is left I will repay fourfold to all whom I have wronged.And Jesus said: You have saved yourself.You were dead but have come to life; you were lost, but have found yourself; for you have done as Abraham did when by being ready to kill his own son he showed his faith.For herein is the whole life of man; to find and save that which is perishing in his soul.A sacrifice cannot be measured by its size.It happened once that Jesus was sitting with his pupils near a collecting-box.Summarization models summary:

People were placing contributions in the box for God's service.Rich men went up to the box and put in much, and a poor widow came and put in two farthings.And Jesus pointed to her and said: See, this poor widow, a beggar-woman, has given two farthings, and she has given more than all the others.For they gave what they did not need, while she has given all she had; she has put in her whole substance.It happened that Jesus was at the house of Simon the leper.And a woman came into the house and she had a jar of precious oil, worth thirty pounds.Jesus was saying to his pupils that his death was near, and the woman heard this and was sorry for him, and to show him her love poured oil on his head.And she forgot everything, and broke her jar, and anointed both his head and his feet, and poured out all the oil.And the pupils began to discuss it, and said she had acted badly.And Judas, who afterwards betrayed Jesus, said: See how much she has wasted.That oil might have been sold for thirty pounds, with which many poor people could have been clothed.And the pupils began blaming the woman, who was abashed and did not know whether she had done well or ill.Then Jesus said: You are wrong to trouble the woman; she has indeed done a good deed, and you are wrong to speak about the poor.If you want to do good to them, do so—they are always there.But why speak of them now?If you pity the poor, go with your pity and do them good.But this woman has pitied me and done good truly, for she has given away all that she had.Which of you can tell what is needful and what is not?How do you know that there was no need to anoint me with the oil?

She has poured it on me to prepare my body for burial, and for that it was wanted.She has truly done the will of the Father by forgetting herself and pitying another.She forgot her worldly reckonings and gave away all that she had.And Jesus said: My teaching is to do the Father's will, and His will can only be fulfilled by deeds, and not by words only.If a man's son keeps saying, 'I will, I will', to his father's bidding, but does not do what his father says, then he does not fulfil his father's will.But if another son says: 'I do not wish to obey', but then goes and does his father's bidding—he indeed fulfils his father's will.So also with men: not he is in the Father's will who says: 'I am in the Father's will', but he who does what the Father wishes.I AND THE FATHER ARE ONE

And Jesus said: You have a special time and place in which to serve God, but for me there is none.I work for God everywhere and always.That is just what I show to people.I show them that their service of God is wrong and that is why they hate me.Go you to the feast, and I will go when I am ready.And his brothers went, but he remained behind, and only went up at the middle of the feast.The Jews were shocked that he did not honour their feast and delayed coming to it, and they disputed about his teaching.Some said that he was right, while others said that he only disturbed the people.In the middle of the feast Jesus went into the Temple and began to teach the people that their service of God was wrong, and that God should be served not in a temple and by sacrifices, but in the spirit and by deeds.They all listened to him and wondered that he, an unlearned man, should have such wisdom.And Jesus, knowing that all wondered at his wisdom, said to them:My teaching is not my own, but His that sent me.If any man wishes to do the will of the spirit that sent us into life, he will know that I have not invented this teaching but that it is of God.For a man who invents from himself follows his own imagination, but he who seeks to know the mind of Him that sent him is true and there is no falsehood in him.Your law of Moses is not the Father's law, and so those who follow it do not fulfil the Father's law, but do evil and tell falsehoods.I teach you the fulfilment of the will of the Father alone.In my teaching there can be no contradictions, but your written Mosaic law is full of contradictions.Do not judge by externals, but by the spirit.And some said: They said he was a false prophet, but he condemns the law and no one says anything to him.

Perhaps he is really a true prophet and even the rulers have recognized him.But there is one reason for not believing him: it is written that when God's messenger shall come no one will know whence he came, but we know where this man was born and we know his whole family.The people still did not understand his teaching, and still sought proofs.Then Jesus said to them: You know me, and where I came from in the body, but you do not know where I come from in the spirit.You do not know Him from whom I come in spirit, and that is the one thing it is necessary to know.If I had said: 'I am the Christ', you would have believed me, the man, but you would not have believed the Father who is in me and in you.You should believe in the Father only.For the short space of my life I point out to you the path to that source of life from which I have come.But you ask of me proofs, and wish to condemn me.If you do not know that path, then when I am no longer here you will not be able to find it.You should not judge me but should follow me.He who does what I say will know whether what I say is true.He for whom the life of the flesh has not become merely food for the spirit, he who does not seek truth as a thirsty man seeks for water, cannot understand me.He who thirsts for truth, let him come to me and drink.And he who believes my teaching will obtain true life.He will receive the life of the spirit.And many believed his teaching and said: What he says is true, and is of God.Others did not understand him, and were always seeking in the prophecies for proofs that he was sent from God.And many disputed with him but no one was able to controvert him.Summarization models summary:

And you will perish if you remain in this error and do not follow me.The Jews asked: Who are you?He said: I told you when I first began to teach: I am the son of man, acknowledging the spirit as my Father, and what I have understood from him I tell to the world.When you exalt the son of man in yourselves you will know what I am, because I do and speak not of myself as a man, but what the Father has taught me.He who sent me is always in me and will not leave me, for I do His will.He who keeps to my understanding of life and fulfils the will of the Father will be truly taught by me.To know the truth you must do good to men.He who does harm to men loves the darkness and goes towards it; he who does good to men goes to the light.So to understand my teaching you must do good.He who does good will know the truth; he will be free from evil, from death.For everyone who errs becomes the slave of his error.And as a slave does not always live in his master's house while the master's son does, so a man if he errs in life and becomes the slave of his errors does not live always, but dies.Only he who is in the truth remains always living.To know truth is to be a son and not a slave.If you err, you will be slaves and will die: but if you are in the truth you will be free sons and will live.You say of yourselves that you are sons of Abraham, and that you know the truth.Yet you wish to kill me because you do not understand my teaching.And it comes to this, that I speak what I have understood from my Father while you wish to do what you have understood from your father.They said: Our father is Abraham.Jesus said to them: If you were the sons of Abraham you would do his deeds.
