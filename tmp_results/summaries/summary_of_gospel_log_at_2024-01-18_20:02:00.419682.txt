Perhaps he is really a true prophet and even the rulers have recognized him.But there is one reason for not believing him: it is written that when God's messenger shall come no one will know whence he came, but we know where this man was born and we know his whole family.The people still did not understand his teaching, and still sought proofs.Then Jesus said to them: You know me, and where I came from in the body, but you do not know where I come from in the spirit.You do not know Him from whom I come in spirit, and that is the one thing it is necessary to know.If I had said: 'I am the Christ', you would have believed me, the man, but you would not have believed the Father who is in me and in you.You should believe in the Father only.For the short space of my life I point out to you the path to that source of life from which I have come.But you ask of me proofs, and wish to condemn me.If you do not know that path, then when I am no longer here you will not be able to find it.You should not judge me but should follow me.He who does what I say will know whether what I say is true.He for whom the life of the flesh has not become merely food for the spirit, he who does not seek truth as a thirsty man seeks for water, cannot understand me.He who thirsts for truth, let him come to me and drink.And he who believes my teaching will obtain true life.He will receive the life of the spirit.And many believed his teaching and said: What he says is true, and is of God.Others did not understand him, and were always seeking in the prophecies for proofs that he was sent from God.And many disputed with him but no one was able to controvert him.

The Orthodox teachers of the law sent their assistants to contend with him, but these assistants returned to them and said: We can do nothing with him.And the chief priest said: How is it you have not convicted him?They replied: No one ever spoke as he does.Then the Orthodox said: It signifies nothing that you cannot refute him and that the people believe his teaching.We do not believe it and none of the rulers believe it.The people are accursed, they always were stupid and ignorant, and will believe anyone.But Nicodemus, to whom Jesus had explained his teaching, said to the chief priests: A man should not be condemned without being heard, and without understanding what he teaches.But they said to him: There is nothing to hear or to understand.We know that no prophet can come from Galilee.Another time Jesus spoke to the Orthodox and said: There can be no proof of the truth of my teaching, just as you cannot have an illumination of light.My teaching is the real light by which people see what is good and what is bad, and so it is impossible to prove my teaching; everything else is proved by it.He who follows me will not be in darkness but will have life.Life and enlightenment are one and the same.But the Orthodox said: It is only you who say this.And he replied: If I alone say it, still I am right, for I know whence I come and whither I go.In my teaching life has a meaning, but according to yours it has none.Besides, not I alone teach this, but my Father, the spirit, teaches it too.They said: Where is your Father?He replied: You do not understand my teaching or you would know my Father.You do not know whence you are nor whither you go.I show you the way, but instead of following me you discuss who I am; and so you cannot reach that salvation and life to which I wish to lead you.Summarization models summary:

And you will perish if you remain in this error and do not follow me.The Jews asked: Who are you?He said: I told you when I first began to teach: I am the son of man, acknowledging the spirit as my Father, and what I have understood from him I tell to the world.When you exalt the son of man in yourselves you will know what I am, because I do and speak not of myself as a man, but what the Father has taught me.He who sent me is always in me and will not leave me, for I do His will.He who keeps to my understanding of life and fulfils the will of the Father will be truly taught by me.To know the truth you must do good to men.He who does harm to men loves the darkness and goes towards it; he who does good to men goes to the light.So to understand my teaching you must do good.He who does good will know the truth; he will be free from evil, from death.For everyone who errs becomes the slave of his error.And as a slave does not always live in his master's house while the master's son does, so a man if he errs in life and becomes the slave of his errors does not live always, but dies.Only he who is in the truth remains always living.To know truth is to be a son and not a slave.If you err, you will be slaves and will die: but if you are in the truth you will be free sons and will live.You say of yourselves that you are sons of Abraham, and that you know the truth.Yet you wish to kill me because you do not understand my teaching.And it comes to this, that I speak what I have understood from my Father while you wish to do what you have understood from your father.They said: Our father is Abraham.Jesus said to them: If you were the sons of Abraham you would do his deeds.

But you wish to kill me because I have told you what I have learnt from God.Abraham did not act like that.You do not serve God, but serve another father.They said to him: We are not bastards, we are all sons of one Father, we are all God's children.And Jesus said to them: If your father were one with me you would love me, for I came forth from the Father; I was not born of myself.You are not children of one Father with me, so you do not understand my words and my understanding of life finds no place in you.If I am of the Father and you are of the same Father, then you cannot wish to kill me.If you wish to kill me, we are not of the same Father.I am from the Father of goodness, God: but you are from the father of evil, the devil.You wish to do the lusts of your father who always was a murderer and a liar with no truth in him.If he, the devil, says anything, he says not what is common to all, but what is his own, and he is the father of lies.So you are servants of the devil and are his children.You see how plainly you are convicted of error.If I err, convict me; but if there is no error in me why do you not believe me?And the Jews began to revile him and to say that he was possessed.He said: I am not possessed.I honour the Father, and you wish to kill me, which shows that you are not my brothers but sons of another father.It is not I who affirm that I am right, but the truth that speaks for me.And so I repeat to you: he who comprehends my teaching and performs it shall not see death.And the Jews said: Now, were we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a devil?You convict yourself!Summarization models summary:
