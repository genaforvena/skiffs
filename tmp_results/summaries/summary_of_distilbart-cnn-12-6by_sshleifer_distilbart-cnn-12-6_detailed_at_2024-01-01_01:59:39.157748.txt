This work may be in the public domain in In making it I hardly had to digress from the order in which it is set down in the Gospels, so that there are not more but fewer transpos True life is life in the present, common to all men and manifesting itself in love . True life unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life Each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters . In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down In the present rendering the following are omitted: the conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, his The customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error

Summarizing: . Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato The reader should remember that there were very many accounts from among which the Churches selected first three Gospels and then one more, and that in selecting those best Gospels The reader should remember that far from it being blameworthy to discard useless passages from the Gospels and elucidate some passages by others, it is on the contrary I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this—that when I was fifty years old, having asked myself and all the learned men around me I was in the position of a man who receives a bag of stinking dirt, and only after long struggle and much labor finds that amid that dirt lie priceless pear The chief question was not whether Jesus was or was not God, or from whom the Holy Ghost proceeded, and equally unimportant and unnecessary was it for me to know According to this false interpretation Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations beginning with the commencement of the world and continuing in the Church until now .

They try to understand the meaning of his appearance and the spread of his teaching by Historians of Christianity are so pleased to have understood that Jesus was not God and are so anxious to prove that his teaching is not divine and is therefore not obligatory . The essential thing is not to prove that Jesus was not God and that therefore his doctrine is not divine, but to know in all its purity what constituted that teaching . The teaching of Christ as set forth in this book (despite the identity of name) is quite a different teaching from that which he professes
