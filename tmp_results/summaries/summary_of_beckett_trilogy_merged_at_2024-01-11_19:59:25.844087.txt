SAMUEL BECKETT and another person stopped, face to face, on a deserted road on an evening and observed each other for a good fifteen paces before turning towards the sea which was far in the east, beyond the fields, and loomed high in the waning sky.
They exchanged a few words before each went on their separate ways back towards the town.

The blowing of a rubber horn has given me only a mild pain in the balls.
I used to ride a bicycle and every hundred yards or so I would stop to rest.
When riding a bicycle, MOLLO Y 17, I didn't properly get off the machine and remained astride it until I felt comfortable.
After stopping to rest, I took off the horn from my bicycle and kept it about me.
The horn is still with me and I often use it to blow a motor-car horn when I see a lowered window of a stationary car.
My journey began in the second

I communicate with my mother by knocking on her skull and communicating using four knocks, one of which means yes, two no, three I don't know, four money, and five goodbye.
When communicating with her, I stick a banknote under her nose or in her mouth at the same time as I administer the four knocks.
The old woman is under the influence of ammonia and her shrunken, hairy old face lights up when she smells me.
Due to her intoxication, the old woman jabbered with a

A MOLLOY 27 was walking along a tow-path when she noticed a team of grey donkeys on the far bank and heard angry cries and dull blows from them.
The team was carrying a cargo of nails and timber, which was on its way to a car-penter on a barge.
A boatman of the barge was a man with a long white beard and a pipe who spat into the water.
She was walking to see her mother at the beginning of an ending day and had forgotten the reasons for her journey.

He believes he will meet the sergeant and his merry men again and has an impression that his mother thinks she is alive.
A certain night where he was alone, with nothing but silence and the little lights

A shepherd and his dog were walking ahead of MOLLOY and were not leaving the path.
MOLLOY identified them from the bleating of a sheep and the dog's anxious bleating.
She asked the shepherd and dog where they were going, asking if they were heading to the fields or to the shambles.

SAMUEL BECKETT and the long sonata of the dead is a character in a poem by Samuel Beckett.
Samuel has a strong sense of knowing what the words know and the dead things.
He once resolved to stop by the kerb and ask a passer-by for the name of his town.
This resolution was aborted when his bicycle ran over a dog and he fell to the ground.
The dog that was run over by the bicycle was not out on the road but in on the pavement, docile and docile at its mistress's heels.


The character MOLLOY 33 was caught by a bloodthirsty mob of both sexes and ages who were preparing to tear him to pieces.
A lady accused him of killing Teddy, a man whom she loves like her own child.
Teddy is an elderly, blind, deaf, crippled, crippled with rheumatism, and perpetually incontinent, spending his days indoors and outdoors, indoors and out of dtfors.

During the conversation,

Samuels BECKETT is a character who frequently betrays his emotions and often does not fully understand what is being expressed.
Samuel has a strong emotional attachment to his mother who has killed her dog.
SAMUEL feels compelled to help his mother get rid of her dog because he feels morally obligated to do so.

Sophie poked a dog with a malacca, presumably a yellow mongrel or pedigree dog, who was fatally injured.
The dog was buried in a house where Samuel BECKETT, a dog, was buried under a tree.
Samuel Beckett's wife was able to dig the hole without using a trowel or a spade and had her leg amputated at the groin due to a sick leg due to her condition.
Lousse, the house where Sophie lived, is not nearby but is not far away.


Loussc and the dog were buried without any box or wrapping, just with the dog's collar and lead and a shovel.
The dog was heavy, cold, and smelly, but not worse than an old dog, and Loussc was unable to dig the hole due to a leg injury.
They have been accused of false witness, which has led to a lifelong charge against them.
There are decaying circus clowns who got in the way of Louissc's attempts to walk, sit down, and ride his bicycle.

My mother is far away from me, but I was a little closer to her the previous night.
If I were in the right town, my mother would have been absent, whereas if I was in the wrong town, she would be present.
There was a huge moon framed in the window, moving slower than the room or the room itself.
The moon is divided into three segments, one of which remained constant, while the other two segments gained what the left side lost.
I once took an interest in astronomy, geology, anthropology, and other disciplines connected with it, including psychiatry.


MOLLOY 41 has seen a world at an end and believes that the world's end brought it forth and began the beginning of its end.
The narrator describes the place described as a world collapsing endlessly, a frozen world, under a faint untroubled sky, with no light and no wind, and no loads.
A voice speaks of a world where all wilts and yields, the ground is unfit for loads, and there is no light towards an end.

SAMUEL BECKETT has seen the moon which sailed gallant and full past his window the previous night.
The new moon has appeared before the previous one, leading south, indicating that the moon has waited for the new moon before launching forth on unknown ways.
Samuel was frightened when he saw a young and slender, possibly young-and-slim moon with a young woman on her back possibly with a shaving.
There was a period of nearly 14 days between SAMUEL seeing A and seeing her mother, indicating a significant delay in their meeting.
After seeing A, SAMU

The moon seen from Lousse's house was seen two nights before and was not on the eve of being full.
The two moons seen from the house were so alike in outline that the nalced eye could not distinguish them.
I concluded that there were two moons, as far from the new as from the full moon, entering their first quarter of their respective phases.
My nights were moonless and the moon foreign, so I had never seen the moon drifting past the window.
In the conversation, MOLLY 43 has crutches and uses them to strike pieces of furniture without damaging them, indicating

A valet helped the character to straighten the tables and chairs he had overturned and put them back into place.

The world around MOLLY 45 seems to shift, as if it has an orbital velocity.
The door in the big frosted window has shifted slightly creating a panel of white wall within its frame.
There are natural causes to these changes and nature has infinite resources.
Despite her natural appreciation for order and niceties, MOLLOY 45 is used to seeing the sun rise in the south and not knowing where she was going, what she was leaving, or what was going with her.
A missing piece of lace to fasten the hat to the buttonhole was an old piece of old lace.

SamuEL BECKETT often throws away all he has about him in a burst of irritation.
A knife, a noble knife, so-called stainless steel with a safety catch, was taken from him at the police-station without his knowledge.
After throwing away the knife, SamuEL Beckett found a very fine vegetable knife stained with rust, stained but stained but didn't take long to stain.
This knife had a dangerous safety catch which led to dangerous cuts on his fingers when he got caught between the handle of an Irish horn and the safety catch.
Despite his lack of understanding

Lousse was in the garden tending a grave and sowing grass in the evening.
MOLLO Y 47 saw Lousse through a window lit by a wild tawny light from the staircase.
Lousse gave food and drink to MOLLY Y 47 who was looking for his bicycle.
The bicycle was found half buried in a soft bush.
Despite not being able to conceive and having never tried, Lousse has a strong desire to have a child.

Lousse is suspected to have poisoned my beer with something intended to mollify me and Molloy.
Lousse made several propositions to me, which I listened to absent-mindedly.
According to Lousse's propositions, Samuel BECKT is not in the town where Lousse is currently located.
In her propositions, Lousse suggested that Samuel BERTTT would live in her home and live there as though it were her own.
She has a strong sense of smell and the smell of spike-lavender, a strongly scented flower, brings to mind Lousse’s grief

MollY 49 is a character who uses lavender to perfume her handkerchiefs, underclothing, and house-linen.
She has a lavender-bag that she made from lavender that she put in her cupboards.
During a night of listening and listening to MOLLY 49, she spent time with her, squatting or kneeling beside her while she was stretched out on the grass, lying on her back, on her stomach, and on one side.
The night was dark with no moon and no other light, giving way to the faint soughing of the

I was once in a jar which knew neither seasons nor gardens.
I was in a place where I could ask questions to keep myself from losing the thread of a dream.
The jar was threadbare and a little threadbare, but I was glad to have it.

SAMUEL BECKETT has a sensitive ear and perceives sounds as pure sounds devoid of any meaning.
 SAMUEL has a hard-of

My eye was ill-connected with the spider and I saw the world in a formal and inordinately formal manner.
I reacted in my own way to nature and to the works of men without seeking enlightenment and was not an aesthete or an artist.
After leaving the image of old Geulincx, who left me free on the black boat of Ulysses, I stayed with Lousse for a few months or a year.
Lousse is described as a person who has not the pioneering spirit and is not a pioneering spirit.
The weather in my part of the world where the

 SAMUEL BECKETT has been under the weather for a long time and has been able to distinguish between different types of weathers.
Samuel has stayed in several different rooms possibly one after the other in the parading universe.
In his head, there are several windows that open variously on the Parading universe and the house and garden are fixed by some unknown mechanism of com- pensation.
When he stayed still, Samuel was not aware of what was going on in the house or the garden and preferred the garden.
SAMUEL heard dull sounds, sharp ones and sharp ones

I am in a high wall-like garden surrounded by a high, high wall with broken glass-like fins.
The garden is protected by a wicket-gate that allows free access to the road.
I can open and close the wicket gate by day and by night.
Lousse is described as a woman who lives in a house with a garden and a house and rarely shows herself to me.
My character prefers to behave in the presence of wishes, active and contemplative, and finds the latter preferred due to my temperament.
During the day, I observe the garden, observing it

I used to sleep in a large garden but now I sleep in an extremely spacious house.
I was given a slow poison by a woman who gave me food and drink.
The woman accused me of drugged my food and drinks with noxious and insipid powders and potions.
Even if I had been drugged, I would have swallowed the poison with the same whole-heartedness as if I hadn't been given the poison.
 SAMUEL BECKETT devours with a voracity usually associated with heavy eaters.
SAMUEL ELIZABETT consumes

I have the ability to levitate in the air and collapse like a puppet when its strings are dropped, causing me to fall and lay long where I fall.
I prepare for this phenomenon much like an epileptic doctor, laying down or wedging myself where he can't be dislodged.
The meal delivered to me was made of a single dish and one slab of bread, served in a small, round, low-r rimless dish coated with red lacquer, and served on a small tray with a low rim and low rim.
During this meal, I ate the meal with my hands and drank

 SAMUEL BECKETT's health did not improve during his stay at Lousse due to existing illnesses.
SAMUEL believes that during his time in Lousse, no new symptoms of a pathological nature appeared and there was nothing unusual or unusual during his stays there.
Samu ELIZABETT experienced a sudden loss of half his half-poesucking stone, which caused him to regret it.
Lousse is described as a woman of extraor-dimensional flatness, physically speaking, with a somewhat hairy face, deep, deep voice, and a hairy face and deep voice.

"I have rubbed up against a few men in my time, but I have not rubbed against a woman before."
A woman named Ruth, possibly named Edith, has a hole between her legs which has a slit.
Ruth has a flat, eminently flat face, short stiff steps, leaning on an ebony stick, and has a yellow nape.
She has voluminous tempestuous shifts and petticoats and undergar- ments whose names I forget.
I have toiled and moiled until I either gave up trying or was begged to stop, which is how

Samuel Beckett and Edith met in a dainty flat in a rubbish dump.
Samuel liked the delicate furniture in the apartment, including a couch that moved forward on its castors.
During their encounter, Samuel cut his toe-nails and rubbed Edith's rump with winter cream.
After the session, Edith died in a warm tub, which was her custom before she met Samuel.
The death of Edith caused Samuel to lose a source of revenue.

The experience of finding a man when one should have found a woman was initially repressed and forgotten by those unfortunate enough to know about it.
Only myself knew about the experience and spoke about it, with the exception of myself.
Despite having met Lousse and having fre- quented her, Lousse showed no interest in the experience.
My memory confuses the roles of my mother and Ruth, thinking of them as one and the same old hag, widowed and withered, both old and wizened.
Ruth used to speak of her defunct husband's inability to satisfy her cravings for

The character 60 SAMUEL BECKETT has left her dog's grave and has sown a garden with many many-coloured flowers and herbaceous plants.
Samuel Beckett left behind her bicycle, which she suspects to be a vehicle of some malignant agency.
A small voice told Samuel Beckett to take her crutches and get out of the shelter.
Despite the presence of a nightwatchman employed to watch over public works, Samuel BeckETT managed to escape from the shelter and found herself on a flight of stairs in a mean lodging-house which was empty before dawn.

I have been in a town for a long time and have been there all the time.
The town was waking, doors were opening and shutting and the noise was deafening.
I found myself in a narrow alley between two high buildings with little windows on every floor facing each other.
This alley is a blind alley with two recesses opposite each other, littered with miscellaneous rubbish and excrements including dog and MOLLO V 61 masters.
In one of the alcoves, I chose to sit instead of lie down, leaning against a wall and using only the tips of my crut

I have a history of backsliding and believe that life is made up of this kind of "backsliding".
 SAMUEL BECKETT advised me to use a knife if necessary.
I had a vegetable knife in my pocket which I used to open my wrist, but the pain caused me to put it back in the pocket and set off towards the least gloomy quarter of the heaven where a vast cloud was shrouding the sky from the zenith to the skylines and rain was falling with no wind.
This quarter was chosen by me because it was the one part of the

The scene takes place in a narrow, narrow doorway where a young old man is alone and shivering in the rain.
The young man approached the old man and stood beside him in an attempt to emulate the example of one jvho who made a speech.
A previous encounter with Lousse and her dog was prevented due to previous encounters with her.
MOLLOY 63 decided to go out into the rain before making the speech to avoid getting wet due to the weather.
In the past, MOLLOY has stolen small objects from Lousse, including a sawing-horse-like cross,

SamUEL BECKBTT considers a strange object that stands with equal stability and stability on any one of its four possible bases, a sawing-horse.
He fond memories of gazing upon the object affectionately and admiring it fondly and believes it has a specific function and is always hidden from him.
According to SamUEL, to him, to know nothing is nothing, not to want to know anything, and to be beyond knowledge is peace.
Upon leaving the shelter of the doorway, Samuel leveraged himself forward using crutches and began swinging slowly through the sullen air

I lost interest in knowing what town I was in and decided to leave the town.
I had been trying to find my mother and settle the matter between them for a lifetime and felt time was running out to settle the issue.
In the country, there is another justice, other judges, at first.
The sky was clearing prior to the winding in the other shroud revealing a pale and dying sky and the sun, already down, with livid tongues of fire darting towards the zenith.
This phenomenon is characteristic of my region and I have never escaped from it.
My region is unknown

I have travelled in a vast region described by Molloy as vast and vast and have never left it.
I have left this vast region many times, thinking I was still within it, but according to a feeling, this region has never left and will never leave.
Whenever I wander within the distant 66 SAMUEL BECKETT limits, I believe that things will always be the same, day after day and vigrit after night.
If regions merge into one another, it would suggest that my movements are due to a buckled wheel that carries me, causing jerks from fatigue.


The story takes place in a place where the shadows lengthen, the walls multiply, and you hug the walls to hide from terror.
The characters in the story are described as less rat-like than toads, less dangerous than rats, and less dangerous to those who know them.
MOLLY 67 was riding a bicycle low in the dark over the earth and along empty country roads.
Despite her fear, MOllOY 67 didn't miss her bicycle.
In the story, the morning is a time for hiding and for order, beauty, and justice for those who wake up, hale and hearty

"There is no mercy for the monster on the move or on the watch, lurking in his lair or in his sleep."
"The monster can benefit from milder feelings, such as gentleness and gentleness, which deflect the barrel of a lethal weapon."
The hunter is weak at heart and senti- mental, overflowing with repressed treasures of gentility and passion.
"Many a foul beast, worthy of extermination, can live on in zoological gar dens, broken only by the innocent laughter and knowiife laughter of children and 68 SAMUEL BECKETT their elders, on Sundays."

I have always believed that my land ends at the coast and not at the sea.
I once went to the sea in an oarless skiff, paddling with an old bit of driftwood.
While at the seaside, I took advantage of having a store of sucking-stones, pebbles, and stones to solve a problem.
In this scenario, I have a greatcoat and a pocket in which I can store stones, each containing four stones.
When I suck, I replace a stone from the right pocket of my greatcoat with one from the left pocket of the trousers

 SAMUEL BECKETT's initial method of transferring the stones was to take three remaining stones from the right jJocket of his greatcoat and replace them with the four remaining in the right pocket of his trousers.
Samuel discovered that if he is certain of finding four different stones in the same pocket, he will always end up with the same four within each group of four.
If Samuel had eight pockets instead of the four he currently has, he could have sucked at least eight of the sixteen stones, increasing his chances of enjoying his stones until their number is exhausted.

T has the capacity to double the number of her pockets, but it is not possible without the help of safety-pins.
T's good leg began to stiffen and she needed a prop under the ham and even under the whole length of the leg to support her.
The story takes place in a world where stones are revolving interminable martingales, crushing Handfuls of sand, and sand runs through fingers and falls back on the strand of earth.
In the story, T is sitting on MOLLOY and has difficulty in sitting on the ground because of her stiffening leg.


The game involves sucking a stone from the right pocket of a greatcoat and putting it in the left pocket.
The player transfers the six stones she sucked to the left side pocket of her greatcoat.
Once the two pockets are empty, the player replaces them with the stones in the right pockets of her trousers.
I have found a solution to a problem that I believe is sound and elegant.
My solution was to put six stones in my great-72 SAMUEL BECKETT coat, five in his left pocket, and five each in his trousers.

In the MOLLOY 73 series, I sucked five stones and transferred them to the left pocket of my greatcoat.
When the right pocket of the greatcoat was empty, I transferred the remaining five stones to the redistribution pocket.
In the redistribution, I replaced the five stones in the right pockets of my trousers with the five in the left pockets.
After the redistribution of the stones, I replace the six stones in my left pocket with the six in my trousers.
I sucked stones in an order similar to the first time, which means that the first, seventh, twelfth, and twelfth res

Samuel Beckett's solution to the puzzle is imperfect but he considers his solution to be the only perfect solution.
Samuel believes that his solution would have freed him from anxiety within each cycle and for the sum of all the cycles.
He finds the uneven distribution of the stones in the puzzle to be painful and inelegant.
There was a kind of equilibrium in the early stages of the puzzle, after the third suck and before the fourth suck, but it did not last long and Samuel felt the weight of the stone dragging him around, dragging him to one side or the other.
Despite being dragged

Samuel BECKETT lives in a cave and feels reasonably secure from the elements and mankind.
Samuel believes that there are prices to be paid in caves and vour boxes.
Watt is an inland town located in a swamp and thousands of human lives are lost each year due to flooding.
Despite adversity, setbacks, epidemics, and apathy, the Public Works Department has begun to work in certain areas of Watt.
There is no direct access to the town of Watt by sea, one has to disembark well to the north or the

My progress has been slow and pain- ful because of a short, stiff leg which is getting shorter and getting stiffer every day.
My other leg, which was supple previously, is also getting shorter but not getting shorter.
The new stiff leg hurts more than the old one because it is the other MOLLO Y 77 which I normally use as a pivot.
Both the old and new injuries are of the same family, but they are of different families.
In the old injury, there was one bad leg and one more or less good one.

I have a short and stiffened leg, one of which is shortening and the other which is not.
The one of the short legs is the worse of the two arJ and is in need of nursing.
I have managed to lengthen my short leg by chance on a road or by taking advantage of a not too deep ditch or breach of surface.
My disability is caused by a constant and monotonous increase of pain caused by work and a decrease of pain dispensed by work.
Due to the state of disequilibrium, my progress suffered and I had to stop more and more often

I am in a place of deep darkness, in towering forests and giant fronds, where I hobble and listen, listen, fall, rise, listen and hobble, wondering if I will ever see the hated light.
I consider hanging myself from a bough, with a liane, to end my story.
She has struggled with the thought of suicide for a long time, but has always overcome the temptation.
During her asthma attacks, she disguises the choking noise as a fit of coughing.
Her asthma attacks occur mostly at night and she wraps her head in a coat to stifle the

I have been at the seaside for a long time and have been experiencing increasing weakness.
My weakness has increased significantly, to the point where I can't believe it is the same hole referred to as the "arse-hole".
The hole has become a symbol of those who have passed over in silence and has become linked to me as a link between me and other excrement.
I believe that the arse hole is the portal of our being and the celebrated 80 SAMUEL BECKETT mouth.
The arse-hole has become an eyesore and a distinc- tion

My health is attributed to moral qualities, hygienic habits, fresh air, lack of sleep, solitude, persecution, and long silent screams.
Mammy, who gave me a nice dose of her unconquerable genes, is the source of my boils.
Santa Maria is my word of honour and I can't piss.
I have a prepuce, sat verbum, oozes urine, and a sense of smell.
My fear is of uremia and fear that it will finish me off.
Despite her fear, I do not believe Mammy is near the end of her career

SAMUEL BERTETT expresses a sense of uncertainty about the future of her possessions.
SAMUSEL believes that the best presentiments are true and can be borne out.
Samusel believes in sentiments sweet and simple.
She used to know only in advance what she was doing, but she no longer knew what to do when it came time for her to make a superhuman effort.
 SAMUSEL regained her ignorance when the superhuman effort was past.
Her progress is becoming more and more slow and painful due to numerous weak points, not solely due to her legs, and she has placed

MoLLY Y 83 has to stop frequently to dislodge clots due to the height of the forest.
The forest is very high and the boughs are twining together at a prodigious height.
MOLLY has to walk in impenetrable darkness, some days she advances only a few paces and others she walks in up to thirty or forty paces.
There is a blue gloom in the forest, which MoLLY sees as blue due to red and green leaves.
Bui often finds herself at crossroads or crossroads in unexplored forests and describes a complete circle

A stranger was born in a forest and has spent his whole life in the same forest.
The stranger is sick with solitude and has a charcoal-burner which he uses to burn charcoal.
He has been living in this same forest for a long time and was born there.
When he asked for directions to the nearest town, he found the necessary words 84 SAMUEL BECKETT and accents to get directions.
Due to his extensive knowledge of the forest, the character in the conversation doesn't know how to leave it.
Another character has been in the forest for many years and has extensive

My region includes plains, mountains, sea, towns and villages connected by highways and byways.
I am a feeble and awk-MOLLOY 85 ward assailant.
Recently, one of my heels sank in something soft but I managed to get up, picked up my crutches, and applied method to the exercise.
If I had missed the ribs and landed in the kidney, I would have landed in a kidney but not hard enough to burst it.
In my region, there is a forest which I avoided by going around a circle in order to avoid the forest.
Despite avoiding the forest

Samuel Beckett considers the forest described by SAMUEL ELIZABETT as not as bad as one might imagine it to be and not worse than other places in his region. 86 SAMU ELIZBETT is aware of the possibility of seeing light tremble through still boughs, strange light from the plain, and bronze-still bough-like light coming from the forest.
Samuel feels compelled to stay in the forest due to an impression of committing a sin and has always been inclined to submit to imperatives, even though these imperatives have led him to places where they

The imperatives were explicit and detailed until they faltered and then went silent, leaving MOLLOY 87 feeling lost and unsure of where he is going or why he is there.
The Imperatives related to the same painful and thorny question and were related to an issue.
There was a new Latin command named Nimis sero that led to the faltering imperatives and the command to leave the forest without delay.
MOLLY 87 has been going to her mother for most of her life with the purpose of establishing their relations on a less precarious footing.
When she was with her mother, MOLL

 SAMUEL BECKETT hears a voice saying "Molloy," which is a line phrase more or less clear and simple.
Beckett is compelled to attribute to others intelligible words or hear her own voice uttering to others.
She expresses her consciousness by saying "I said, etc." or "Don’t do it."
The conversation takes place in a setting where Beckett is stuck and unable to move due to a lack of movement and has to rely on some kind person to carry her during a march.
As the march gets shorter and shorter, Beckett's consciousness

The leaves of many trees have turned black and spongy, making it difficult for me to get out of the forest.
The gloom from the black boughs of the trees slows me down and makes it more difficult to move.
I was expecting the celebrated murmurs in the forest but instead heard a distant gong.
My heart doesn't beat and I rely on hydraulics for the squelch that an old pump makes.
Despite the lack of sound from the leaves before their fall, I listened through a cloth in my pocket and blew the horn through the cloth in his pocket.

SAMUEL BECKETT uses a mode of movement that involves crawling, crawling on his belly, and using hooks, which allows him to move with ease despite chronic arthritis in his wrists.
Samuel's method of movement has allowed him to cover a distance of up to fifteen paces in a forest without stopping and without needing to rest.
He has even crawled on his back, plunging his crutches blindly into thickets and thickets with black boughs for the sky to view.
Due to a fit of temper, Samuel lost his hat due to a bang on his skull and

Molloy has fallen into a ditch and found herself on a vast, rolling plain with only a few towers and steeples of a town, MOLLY 91 plains.
The town is not familiar to Molloy, but it is familiar to her region.
Molly has not heard a bird for a long time and has not seen any birds in the forest nor at the seaside.
Marble has a memory of birds, skylarks, corn-crakes, two travellers who had a club, sheep, and other scenes of his life.
In the story, marble's son

Jacques, also known as Moran, has a son named Jacques.
Jacques is unaware of the importance of his work and believes he is on the threshold of real life.
Both Jacques and his son are aware of each other's names.
The father, also named Jacques, is unable to sleep and will get up and go to his desk to work on his report.
 Jacques has always loved doing and has a fondness for it.
He was asked to see about Molloy on a Sunday in summer.
During the weekdays, Jacques would have rested if he could afford it, but

Samuel Beckett visited Gaber's house on a Sunday to pay his respects.
Gaber is not a neighbor of Samuel Beckett and their business dealings are strictly of a business nature.
SAMUEL Beckett approached Gaber directly under her Beauty of Bath which is a short path leading from the garden-gate to the front door of her house.
Beckett's son was spying on them from behind a bush.
The son was about 13 or 14 years old and was big and strong for his age, but his intelligence seemed to be below average.
According to Beckett, his profession

Jacques was instructed by Gaber to read instructions from a notebook and leave his finger as a marker.
Jacques has a habit of leaving his finger in his mouth, which is considered a detestable and unhygienic habit.
Gaber and Jacques are agents who are involved in a conversation about a man named Jacques.
 Jacques has left with his son to attend a private communion offered by Father Ambrose during the course of the afternoon.
Gaber was unaware of Jacques' departure until it was too late for mass due to him attending a conference.
In the conversation, Gaber believes

Samuels Beckett has a history of reprimanding her son who is afraid of her.
Samus Beckett believes that her son might not have attended mass because he was afraid of disturbing or being reprimanded by her due to previous reprimands.
Samantha Beckett feels that she has never been chastened and has been spoiled and neglected, which has left her with bad habits ingrained beyond remedy.
She hopes to spare her son's fear by giving him a good clout from time to time.
The Verger Joly, Father Ambrose, keeps a list of the faithful and keeps a register

MollOY 97 was initially light-minded in her reaction to Gaber's report and initially tried to avoid thinking about it seriously.
The chief's insistence on having me, me Moran, rather than anyone else, should have alerted Molloy 97 to the serious nature of the affair.
Martha is in a bad mood and hasn't seen Jacques, who usually comes for a glass of beer.
SamuEL BECKETT suggests that Martha can have the whole day off for the day and suggests he leaves her alone for the entire day.
Molloy is a heavy eater and enjoys

Gaber is a punctual person who values punctuality and enjoys it.
Gaber went without his beer because he wanted it badly.
Jacques, a neighbour, is aware of Gaber's habits and was aware of his Sunday habits.
 Jacques had been to church alone and did not engage in any social activities after church.
After church, Jacques came back from church and asked Gaber questions about the march of the ceremony.
When Jacques returned from church, he told Gaber to wash his hands and sit down to his lunch before going back to the kitchen where he made an Irish stew.


In the present case, I was tackling the problem of transport with no preparation other than Gaber's report and cognizance of this report.
I decided to leave on an autocycle despite the deteriorating weather and the possibility of rain based on the "fatal pleasure principle".
My son suggested to go to the Elms, a place they call their little public park, but there was no elm in it.
SAMUEL BECKETT has been told by my son about botany and asked him to go over his botany knowledge.
Samuel BecketT is suspected of

The servant showed me to the presbytery where Father Ambrose was sleeping.
Father Ambrose offered me a cigar, which I accepted and put in my pocket between my fountain-pen and propel-pencil.
I asked Father Ambrose if he noticed my son at the last mass and he confirmed that Jacques and Father Ambrose had spoken to each other at the front row during the mass.
Jacques feared that Father Ambrose might be ill and asked for a dear child to reassure him.
After the mass, Jacques offered Father Ambrose a glass of something to drink.
MOLLY 101 asked for guidance from the Lord

The priest, Father Ambrose, gave a portable pyx to the chemist's wife, Mrs Clement, who had fallen from the top of a ladder and broken her neck in her laboratory.
Mrs Clement also broke her femur in the fall.
Samuel Beckett and his wife are concerned about their hens, particularly their grey hen who has not laid for a month and has been doing nothing but sitting in the dust from morning to night.
Mr. Beckett believes it is a joy to laugh from time to time, which he finds peculiar to man.
He believes that animals never laugh and that it takes

I had an interview with Father Ambrose who proposed to have her swallow dessertspoonfuls of a dessert-like substance several times a day for a few months.
I declined Father Ambrose's proposal because the chemist was closed and I had forgotten about it.
The interview left me with a painful impression and I felt like one who has swallowed a pain-killer, feeling like a person who is first astonished and indignant after swallowing the substance.
After the interview, I returned home in the pouring rain feeling heavy and distressed.
Her son entered her room without knocking and masturbated before her cheval-

My son has a special way of saying "papa" which he uses when he wants to hurt me.
Samuel has an appointment with Mr 104 SAMUEL BECKETT Py for a tooth extraction scheduled for the following day.
Mr Py has a history of treating people with bad teeth and believes that Sam will have bad teeth for the rest of his life due to his naturally bad teeth due to being born with them all his life.
In his knapsack, I gave him birthday gifts, toilet things, one shirt, one pair of socks, seven pairs of drawers, and two pairs

My son was examining the inside of his mouth with a small glass and prising away his upper lip with his finger.
It was raining heavily, but the sky was overcast and there was no rift in the sky.
I advised my son to draw the curtains and asked him if he was waiting for his stamps.
My son has two albums, a big one for his collection properly speaking and a small one for duplicates, and I had authorised him to bring the latter.
Martha and I were having dinner at home when we decided to leave and I did not tell her about our departure.

SamuEL BECKETT is annoyed by the Eisner sisters who make too much music.
Hannah, the old cook, used to call Hannah and whisper through the railings, which annoyed Hannah, who never went out and didn't like Hannah's dislike of going out.
SAMUEL Beckett has an aberdeen named Zulu who is affectionately called "Little Zulu" by people.
Zulu has a strange aversion to God and finds him distasteful, which is why SamuEL has a habit of stroking his ears and uttering wheedling words.


Gaber is a messenger who is entitled to a notebook due to his role as an agent.
Gaber was protected by a code incomprehensible to all but himself and required to submit his code to MOLLOY 107, the directorate, before being appointed as a messenger.
The messenger's memory is so bad that his messages have no existence in his head and only exist in his notebook.
Despite his poor memory, Gaber was able to reflect on his messages and draw conclusions without losing any of his memories, including the text and gloss.
Gaber believes that the messengers' memory is good enough to

Gaber and I are the only agents of our kind in the group.
Gaber has never seen any other messenger other than himself.
In the group, each agent has their own particular messenger.
Despite living a wretched existence at six pounds ten a week plus bonuses and expenses, I had made away with Gaber and the chief (one Youdi).
I considered myself responsible for my existence and felt that I was not made for the great light that devours and had only a dim lamp for light and patience to shine it on empty shadows.
Martha was sitting in her rocking-chair in the chim

Martha asked to keep her rocking-chair in the kitchen.
Gaber and Martha kept their weekly supply of lager, half-a-dozen quart bottles, delivered every Saturday.
They emptied one bottle from the weekly supply and left five bottles in the pantry.
The pantry contained five bottles, corked and sealed, and one open bottle three-quarters empty, which Martha took to her son's room where he was admiring his stamps.
A conversation takes place in a room where a father and son are arguing about a rare and valuable stamp collection.
1 accuses his father

SAMUEL BECKETT has a duty to protect his son's albums, which he keeps in a safe until their return home.
SAMU ELIRA is upset with her son's lack of respect and demands that he put the albums in the safe until they return.
Samuel possesses the ability to use magic words which he didn't understand until his fifteenth year.
 SAMUEL has a strong emotional attachment to the albums and has a deep-seated desire to keep them away from him.
He believes that the loss of his most precious stamps would have been an act of disrespect.

Samuel Beckett has experienced a sudden change in his life causing him to feel a sense of fear, confusion, and fear.
Samuel interprets this change as a touch of neuralgia.
Despite his feelings of fear and confusion, Samuel goes back to work and trusts more serious and imputable to pleasure than he does to his work.
After dinner, Samuel decides to spend his time alone.
He believes lying down is the best place for him to penetrate the outer turmoil's veil, discern his quarry, find peace in another's distress, and pass judgement on those who are plunged in it and those

I was conducting an unprofitable examination which may have established a connection between me and a man named Molloy.
I had no colleagues and knew nothing of MollOY's existence prior to meeting him.
Molloy 1 was not mentioned to me by anyone but myself and I believe I had invented him, as if he were ready-made in my head.
Despite having no colleagues, I felt an immense uneasiness due to the fact that I was alone in this affair.
The mother of Mellose, who is not mentioned by anyone other than herself, caused me to feel alarmed

Gaber has mentioned Molloy multiple times and has a preference for the ending of the story.
Gaber feels compelled to admit that she should have said Mollsoy and that in saying Mollose she was at fault.
Molls had very little room and was limited in his time.
SAMUEL BECKETT is depicted as a massive, hulking, dark colour prisoner who has thrown himself at a specific target and sought refuge near the centre of a large, open space.
Samuel moves slowly, like a bear, and appears to be constantly on the move, occasionally stopping

The character is described as hunchback-like, craggy, and grimacing.
The character has allowed himself to be haunted and possessed by chimeras.
He is meticulous and calm in the main, dedicated to the outer world, and has a strong preference for the lesser evil.
I am a solitary individual who sees the existence of MOLLOY 115 as a weakness to be deplored but necessary if she wishes to remain that way.
She clung to her solitary existence with less enthusiasm than MOLLY 115, her hens, or her faith.
MOLLY

Samuels BecketT was preparing to face Gaber's report and get down to the official facts when the sound of a gong, struck with violence, filled the house at 9 o'clock.
The character SAMUEL BECKETT was working for an anonymous cause for those old craftsmen whose race is extinct and the mould broken.
There is a strong resemblance between the character named "Molloy T" and elements of "Gaber" described by Gaber.
A character named Youdi is one of the five Molloys mentioned by Samuel Beckett.
Youdi is

Martha made a joke which pleased MOLLOY 117 and made her laugh.
The soup served to MOLLY 117 was called "The sequel" by Martha.
Jacques refused to eat the soup, saying he's not hungry.
Shepherd's pie is a dish Martha serves to the turkeys she raises and considers better for their health and well-being.
According to Martha, the soup was served after the rain had stopped and scarves of fine red sheen were mount- ing in the sky in the west.
 Jacques was scarred in the face when he saw Martha's joke and

Martha and her son are having a conversation about a bird.
The bird referred to in the conversation is a bird from the previous day.
Martha suggests to her son to eat something hot before leaving because he has a stomach-ache.
Her son denies that he told Martha that they were leaving.
Their daughter has just made a pie for her inexperienced son.
My son was asked to fetch a minute-thermometer from the second right-hand drawer of my desk.
I asked my son to take his temperature and bring the thermometer to me.
In a jovial manner

My desk has only six drawers and three drawers on each side of the space where I put my legs.
My son returned with a minute thermometer and handed it to me because he had a temperature.
The son did not have time to wipe the temperature on the minute temperatureometer, which made me squint at the mercury.
In the winter, I would find my slippers warming in front of the fire and wonder if Father Ambrose had shat.
I gave Father Ambrose an enema with salt water and gave him a little wind.
Father Ambrose lay down on the tiles and let the

SAMUEL BECKETT has a strained leg and acute pain in his knee.
Samuel has no food in his stomach and is unable to eat anything.
He asks his father for iodine to help him with his acute pain.
The family is leaving in an hour or so.
In the story, the characters read a story about two old hands, veined, ringed, seeking each other.
 SAMUEL used iodine to rub iodine into his knee, which is full of little loose bones.
After using iodine, Samuel let the iodine soak in and listened to a conversation with

Molloy 121 asked MollOY 121 how long she expected to be away and left a laden tray at the foot of the stairs and went back to the kitchen to make sandwiches.
The milk in the fridge was getting cold and form- ing a revolting skin, indicating that it was getting low in milk.
During her leave, Molloyle 121 dissolved a sleeping-pow- der in the milk and left sandwiches for Martha.
Martha has been in the service for a long time and has never been taken leave of before.
After leaving, Martha asked for a report from the

My son has been absent for a long time and usually comes to fetch the thermometer.
My son's favorite stamps include the Togo one mark carm! 10 with the pretty boat, the Nyassa 1901 ten reis, and several others.
I found 122 SAMUEL BECKETT from the tray a^c and decided to take it.
Molloy has a voluble personality and is extremely voluble when he thinks I'm not present.
Despite Molloy's volubility, I was able to dampen his disposition and prevent him from taking advantage of the opportunity

My son likes sleeping with a night-light beside him.
I have a responsibility to provide for my son and feel a sense of satisfaction in knowing that if he dies, it would be none of my doing.
Recently, I went to the garden and searched in almost total darkness in search of a cigar and found it in my pocket the next day.
The cigar was intended to be put in an ash-tray or waste-paper basket, but it ended up in the garden.
In the house, I was feeling low and confronted the darkness in the kitchen, where I found the cigar.


SAMUEL BECKETT discovered a faint reddish glow in the kitchen.
The kitchen is equipped with a simple gas-stove, aneal oven, and a night-light with a red chimney and Virgin carved in wood.
Samuel has a habit of prowling in the night and peering through windows.
Moran was preparing to go on an expedition without consulting a map or time-table, without planning his route or itinerary, and without considering the weather outlook.

I chose to wear a heavy pair of black boots and a heavy massive-handled winter umbrella.
My straw boater, which was yellowed and had lost its band, was worn.
I considered wearing a black cloak, but decided to wear the heavy umbrella due to its serviceable qualities.
The heavy umbrella is a serviceable garment that provides freedom of movement to the arms and concealing them.
Despite having more than one winter umbrella, I consider it to be an indispensable garment.
When a father is seen out with his young hopeful son, his face grows longer and longer and he is seen for

SAMUEL BECKETT is a person who leaves her house, her garden, her village, and her house with regret.
SamUEL has a son who is restless, plaintive, and whinny for food, whining for sleep.
She gave her son morphine tablets from her night-table drawer.
A chain attached to braces prevents SamUEL from losing the keys to her house.
The chain is four or five times longer than necessary and lies coiled on a bunch of keys in SamUel's pocket, which she carries with her wherever she goes.

I was disgusted by Martha's exhibition and had to use an umbrella to prevent anger.
I had bored two holes in the brim of my boater and secured the ends of an elastic to the elastic, which allowed the umbrella to pass under my chin, under my jaws, and stay on my head.
After the exhibition, I went to a shed and hacked at an old chopping-block in the yard, splitting it with an axe.
My son and I walked through a shambles through a wooded area with a narrow path and a narrow wicket-gate at midnight.
The path was too

The scene takes place in a wooded area with a single chimney-stack and a serrated ridge.
The house is partly hidden by a little wood.
There are songbirds who knew and feared this character.
This character used to love her trees, bushes, flowerbeds, and tiny lawns for their growth and happiness.
She grew no vegetables and lied about having turkeys and a few hens.
Her grey hen was found on the ground, on a perch with the others, in a corner, at the mercy of the rats.

My son often took a wrong turn or took a simple corner due to his father's election.
My son and his father walked separately and took a route that led them from home to church and from church to home.
I waited for my son to come back and spoke the words calculated to settle this matter.
Samuel Beckett and his son have a tendency for their son to wander off and leave them alone in a strange place.
The father suggests using a chain, not a soft, silent rope, to prevent their son from escaping.

The role of the keeper and sick-nurse is to keep an eye on her son during an expedition.
Midnight struck from the steeple of her beloved church and she was away from home.
Her son chose to go to the left instead of the left.
It was the summer holidays and her son was wearing a green school cap with initials and a boar's head or deer's head in gold braid on the front.
The son was carrying his raincoat instead of folding it in a ball and was holding it with both hands, on his belly, instead of carrying it folded over his arm

My son has received a scout-knife for his first first prize in history and geography, subjects he excelled in.
My son was a great scholar, especially in literature and the so-called exact sciences.
He had a deep understanding of the human race's slow ascen- sion towards light and deep respect for the configuration of frontiers and heights of mountain peaks.
Samuel Beckett is a character in the Schoolboys' Classics, a book about a character named Monte Cristo. 132SAMUEL BECKETT has a knife in his pocket which he was about to use to cut

I am a servant who has been forced to conduct her duties in a tedious relation.
I have no intention of relating the adventures which befell me and my son before they came to the Molloy country.
Despite this, I am willing to share these adventures if it gives satisfaction to her employer and his colleagues.
The voice that I follow is ambiguous and not always easy to understand, but I follow the voice no matter what it commands.
If I submit to a scriven- ing which is not of my province, it is for reasons very different from what might be supposed.

MoLLO Y 133 is concerned about her freedom and her future.
She fears losing her home, her garden, trees, lawns, birds, and the way of life in her country of origin, Molloy.
MollO has worked hard to build, adorn, and keep her home and believes she is too old to start again.
Despite her desire to share her journey from her country, MoLLO does not intend to relate all the vicissibilities of her journey.
As a penance, MLLO rarely mentions details that are no longer unknown to her but fondly

 SAMUEL BECKETT has never crossed the Molloy country, a narrow region known as the Bally market-town.
The region referred to as Bally is situated in the north, situated in a less bleak region, and has a surface area of five or six square miles.
Bally was described as a settlement, dignified by some with the name of Bally and by others as a village.
There are two sub-divisions in Bally, Ballyba and Turdy.
Turdy is the hub of Turdyba, a country outside Bally.

SamuEL and his son walked for several days to avoid being seen on the highways.
Samuel found Father Ambrose's cigar in a pocket after finding it in the ashtray, in the waste-paper basket, and in the pocket of his suit.
The cigar was found by Samuels after he changed his suit and lit it.
After finding the cigar, SamuEL showed his son how to use his pocket-compass.
Ballyba is a small village located on a meandering land with no cultiva- tion due to the existence of a sacred grove or stretch

The story takes place in a field where a farmer is approaching a group of people, including a father and son.
The father took the son by the arm and led him away in the direction of the farmer's field.
This group was going home and had not yet left the field when the farmer offered to give them a lift and welcome.
They turned their faces to the north and went in a different direction.
MOLLO Y 137 is working under a shelter under the boughs of a tree in the woods trying to reconstruct Gaber's instructions to complete his statement to complete the Yerk affair

I found Yerk on the third day of my work.
I was tasked with bringing a per-son to a certain place at a certain time for a delicate affair.
Yerk was not a woman and I had never dealt with a woman before.
Sammie has not seen any of her patients after she finished her work and has not heard from any of them again.
 SAMMUEL Beckett was given directions by Gabcr to deal with Molloy, but she was unable to follow the directions.

Molloy and Gaber were on their way on foot when an incident occurred while I was attempting to fall asleep beside my son.
I experienced a sensation similar to that of a blow similar to a horse's hoof and reacted in a similar manner to it, waiting anxiously for the pain to recur and sweating profusely.
The sensation recurred several times, each time less bad than the previous one, until it subsided and I was able to go to sleep more or less reassured.
This sensation had occurred before in my bath- room when giving my son his enema.

SAMUEL BECKETT woke me up early in the night.
Samuel believes he has a touch of neuralgia caused by tramping and trudging and cold damp nights and promises himself to get a packet of thermogene wool with a pretty demon on the outside.
He woke up with a mild erection and a natural need to make things more lifelike.
Due to severe pain in his knee, Samuel was initially unable to bend his leg, but he managed to bend it slightly.
The pain in Samuel's knee was so severe that it was impossible for him to kneel and

The experience of paralysis has given me a new understanding of human psychology.
Paralympics offer the ability to explore the horizontal like a child in its mother's lap when physically unable to stand or sit.
After paralysis, one has the advantage of local and painless paralysis.
My son woke up feeling ill and told me he didn't feel well.
I asked my son about the location of the nearest village, Condom, which he named.
Condom is located on the Baise and I advised him to buy a bicycle, giving him five pounds in ten-shilling.
The village Cond

142 SAMUEL BECKETT was instructed to buy a bicycle from Hole, a distance of about 15 miles away.
Samuel Beckett understood the instructions but did not look pleased.
SAMUEL BUYED a bicycle second-hand from a venture which he had heard about from another person.
142 SAMnotes is a strong carrier of second hand, restful change, dialogue, and money.
Due to illness, Samuel Beckett emptied his pockets creating a cloud of dust.
I suspected that he had stolen ten shillings and was trying to hide them in his pockets.

I gave him notes worth 143 pounds ten shillings, which turned out to be only four pounds ten instead of five pounds.
I advised him to buy a second-hand bicycle.
During the conversation, I told him about a ball of tangled string with ten-shillings-worth of notes possibly inside it.
The ball of string could have been a second hand bicycle, which he agreed to buy at Hole, a place located about fifteen miles away.
While I was away on business, I did not keep the most rigorous accounts when throwing money away.

SamuEL BECKETT intended to buy a bicycle from Turdy.
Jacques Moran gave instructions to Samuel to buy the bicycle in Hole, which was the nearest locality.

My son was running away from me when I hurled a live bough in his direction.
My son reacted with fear, fearing that I would run after him.
I have a terrifying running style, with my head flung back, teeth clenched, elbows bent to the full, and knees nearly hitting me in the face, and I often catch faster runners who stop and wait for me.
It was in anticipation of those happy days that I had thought of the lamp and cried out to my son to buy a good lamp and advised him about the bell, advising him to unscrew the cap and examine it to ensure it

I was walking when a great weariness seized hold of my leg and I had to stop due to a heaviness.
I questioned why I did not tell my son about my condition and why I had hidden it from him.
After the incident, I wondered if I was secretly glad that this had happened to me, possibly to the point of wanting to get better.

Once equipped, I no longer restricted myself to circling around the shelter and radiated from it in every direction, gaining a better view of the expanse from which my fire emanates.

The shelter is becoming their little home and they are running out of their provisions of food.
