The concept of Oedipus is both structural and imaginary, with the latter being described as "desiring-production".
Jacques Lacan's translator, Anthony Wilden, suggested the term "Desiring-Production" as a translation of T7ie Language of the Self (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1968), p. xv.
In this discussion, the concept of Desiring-Machines is capitalized in reference to Jacques Lacan.
The idea of desiring production and the Oedipal structure is presented as an equivalence between the productions of the two concepts.
In Lacanian psychoanalysis, the concept of "desiring-production" was used to describe a phenomenon that occurs when we are trying to understand the complex relationships between desire, desire, and object. It describes how the unconscious desires for

Sigmund Freud discovered the OEDI complex in 1897, but didn't give a theoretical form to it until 1923, in The Ego and the Id.
According to Laplanche and Pontalis, Freud confined the OedI complex to two formulations: a separate chapter on object-choice at puberty (Three Essays) and a chapter on typical dreams (The Interpretation of Dreams).
Laplanche believes that Freud's abandonment of the theory of trauma led to his abandonment of his theory of the unconscious.
Despite her belief in a return to Freud's theory, Pontalis does not believe in his theory of dream interpretation. Instead she is more interested in Laplanche's concept of the 're-enactment' of childhood events and his idea that these enactments are not merely mental images but actual experiences that occur during sleep.


Jacques Lacan discusses Oedipus and psychoanalysts in a seminar held in 1970.
Lacan believes that the character serves no purpose and has no relationship with what we do.
In his context, Jacques Lacan was speaking to people who needed to be dealt with tactfully and used the paternal metaphor to describe the Oedips.
He has never spoken of an "Oedips complex".
In PSYCHOANALYSIS and FAMILIALISM: THE HOLY FAMILY: S3, Lacan suggests that seduction and infantile sexuality are interrelated.
Freud has never managed to articulate the interrelations of Oedipus with his mother and father, who also have a role in the process.
This is true even though he describes it as "the earliest experience of the child".
The idea of seduction comes from Freud's theory that the

The concept of a sovereign Oedipus is presented in the work of Groddeck.
According to the works of Freud, the production of desire leads to a representation of the unconscious, which expresses itself through myth, dream, and tragedy.
The discovery of the productive unconscious has two correlates: a direct confrontation between desiring-production and social production, and the repression of psychic repression with social repression.
Desiring-machines, neurobiologico-desiring, production, collective formations, and repression are discussed in the discussion.
The first part discusses the theory of desire, and presents the concept of a sovereign Oedipus.
It is argued that there is no such thing as a "human" desire, since there is only a human Oedip

Sigmund Freud discovered Oedipus in his self-analysis.
In his self analysis, Freud discovers something about which he remarks "Well now, that looks like OedIPUS!"
According to Freud, the "familial romance" is a paranoiac recording by which desire causes familial determinations to explode and neuroticizes everything in the unconscious.
Freud transforms the familial romance into a mere dependence on Oed.
The relationship between Oed and Sigmund is described as a "substantial relationship" in Freud's analysis.
Oedipus was the name of the Greek King who lived about 469 to 444 BC, according to the classical mythology.
Freud said that he had an Oedipal complex but it didn't cause any problems for him

Freud's discovery of Oedipus marks a turning point in the history of psychoanalysis.
According to Freud, the anoedipal nature of desiring-production is present in psychoanalysis, but it is fitted over the co-ordinates of the oedipal character, Oedipsus.
The psychoanalyst becomes a director for a private theater and grapples with collective agents of production and "antiproduction".
Freud interprets the term "pre-Oedipal" and "para-oed" to describe various terms related to the Oedipus complex, which are not present at the outset in a child's life.
In order for children to develop psychoanalytic concepts such as love and hate, they must have had experiences with them before (Freud, 1896

The conversation takes place in a consulting-room where the door is written "Leave your desiring-machines, orphan and celibate machines, a tape recorder, and a little bike and enter and allow yourself to be oedipalized."
The conversation is about a psychoanalyst's practice of "curing" a psychotic episode.
The process involves the insertion of a "desiring-machine" into the analyst's office, which reverses the contract and introduces a third element, the "desired-machine", into the process.
Oedipus is the character behind the desiring machines and his business is related to them. He is described as having a great fascination with women's breasts and nipples; in one episode he says that he wants to create a machine which will automatically induce women to breastfeed their babies. Oedipus has many devices for this purpose

According to Jean-Jacques Abrahams, "L'homme au magnetophone, dialogue psychanalytique," Les Temps modernes, no.274 (April 1969), Freud's analysis was not in vivo.
The process of oedipalization takes place at a time when Oedi- pus has not yet received its full theoretical formulation and leads a marginal existence.
In a text from 1911, Freud encounters a delirium rich, differentiated, and "divine" as the paternal theme.
Sigmund Freud makes only very brief references to the theme in his memoirs.
The theme of a father's death is not mentioned by Freud except for the analysis of the psychosexual development of a boy who has lost both parents (an analysis which includes an attempt, but not success, at oedipal identification with

56 ANTI-OEDIPUS is a text by Sigmund Freud.
Sigmund suggests that a delirium caused by an "outburst of homosexual libido" could be caused by Dr. Flechsig's person.
When replacing the doctor with the father and commissioning the father to explain the God of deliria, Freud suggests that they take liberties that can be justified only by the advantages they offer in their attempt to understand the phenomenon.
Despite his initial reservations, Freud asserts that it's not his fault if psychoanalysis attests to monotony and encounters the father everywhere.
Freud is interested in how childhood experiences are "transferred" to adulthood, and he notes that Freud was able to transfer many of his own memories of sexual repression into those of a patient.
Sigmund Freud argues that patients

Sigmund Freud invokes two arguments: a sexual argument that involves the union of sexuality and the familial complex and a mythological argument that posits the adequation of the unconscious and the "edifying forces" of myths and religions.
Both arguments are based on a postulate that compares the unconscious against myth and substitutes mere forms for the productive formations.
In the sexual argument, Freud declares himself in agreement with Jung after their break.
According to the postulate, if the unconscious expresses itself adequately in myths and religion, it can be interpreted in one of three ways: in anagogical fashion, toward the "higher" or "higher", or in an analytically-inductive fashion.
The sexual argument is based on a postulate that compares the unconscious against myth and substitutes merely forms for productive formations. The sexual argument is based on the assumption that if the unconscious expresses itself adequately in myths and religion it can be interpreted in

Freud held to his atheism.
The churches around him allowed him to speak and were prepared to prepare behind his back for the reconciliation of the churches and psychoanalysis.
According to Marx, denying God is only a "secondary thing" for denying God in order to posit the existence of man and put man in God's place.
Freudian analysis suggests that the unconscious is no less atheist than an alien being, placing it above man and nature.
A person who knows that the place of man is entirely elsewhere and no longer needs the mediation of myth, they no longer need to go by way of the negation of God.
In Freud's analysis, guilt feelings, psychoanalysis, egoism, and selfishness all appear to be expressions of the denial of God in a disguised form.
Freud has said: "Freudian psychology is essentially atheistic"
Psychoanalysis is atheistic because it denies the existence of a transcend

Sigmund Freud has transformed Oedipus into a criterion of sexuality in his analysis.
In his analysis of social and metaphysical relations, Freud posited the familial complex as an afterthought or beyond of desire.
Another text of Freud's is "A Child Is Being Beaten."
In this text, the fatherless theme of the fantasy is less visible, yet the father's absence is affirmed with great passion and resolution.
The absence of the father in the first of three supposed phases of the girl's fantasy leaves the second phase, where the father shines forth in all.
The third phase sees the mother as a symbol for the father, which is an unusual and almost impossible interpretation to make.
Freud's analysis of Oedipus has been one of his most influential works, with the "fatherless

Freud proposes to reduce the group character of the fantasy to an individual dimension and organize the variations into disjunctions whose use must be strictly exclusive.
He proposes to create two separate fantasy series, a girl-series and a boy-series.
The female fantasy has three phases, the last of which is "boys are beaten by the teacher," while the male fantasy has only two phases, "my mother beats me" and "my father beats me."
The only common aspect of the two fantasy series is the prevalence of the father in both cases.
Something common to both the girl and the boy fantasy is that they include a punishment for bad behavior.
He proposes to create three separate fantasy series, one for boys with a girl as victim and another for girls with a boy as victim.
The third fantasy series is intended for children who

Sigmund Freud discusses the concept of "resignation to Oedipus, to castration, and to assumption of one's sex" in his analysis "Analysis Terminable and Interminable" (1937).
The analysis is included in the Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works.
In the psychological works of James Strachey (New York: Macmillan; London: Hogarth Press, 1964), Vol.23, pp.250-52, Freud discusses two related themes: envy for the penis and a struggle against his passive or feminine attitude towards another male.
Strachey suggests that when trying to persuade a female to have an orgasm he may be caught in "a state of active desire, but at the same time I am not acting out my own desires; instead they are projected onto her". This is a form of "resignation to

Freud developed the concept of bisexuality but was unable or never wanted to give it the analytical position and extension it required.
According to Freud, there is no commonality between the two sexes and they communicate in a transverse mode where each subject possesses both of them but is partitioned off, with each subject communicating with one sex or the other in another subject.
Freud argued that bisexuality is a concept of partial objects and disjunctions in the unconscious.
Melanie Klein, following Melanie Klein, tried to define the unconscious forces of the female sexual organ by using the concepts of Transverse Mode, Partial Objects and Partial Disjunctions.
The concept of mythical castration is discussed by Melanie Klein. The transference-object relationship of the infantile child (the patient) towards the mother can be interpreted as a symbolic representation of the transference-object relationship between the libidinal desire of the male genitalia (the patient's unconscious

"A subject is defined as a fixed ego of one sex or the other who experiences a lack of subordination to a tyrannical complete object."
"The subject is a partial object with a drive that forms the desiring-machine along with it and enters into relationships of connection, disjunc- tion, and conjunction with other partial objects."
The concept of "castration" and "oedipalization" refers to the operation by which psychoanalysis castsrates the unconscious and injects it into the unconscious.
The subject perceives this operation as a practical operation and refuses to accept his recovery from the doctor.
In this context the Women's Liberation movement is correct. Psychoanalysis does castrate, but in its attempt to do so it also injures men.
This is because, when psychoanalysis injects itself into our unconsciousness, we are forced to acknowledge that we have a relationship with ourselves and

Women's Liberation movements involve elements of liberation, including the force of the unconscious, the investment by desire of the social field, and the disinvestment of repressive structures.
The question of whether women are castrated is ambiguous and requires belief.
In a group fantasy, "a child is being beaten, children are being beaten," there is a mise en scene directed by a social desiring. The unconscious forces that direct such fantasies are both sexual and maternal; the investment of desire by the social field creates the force to be applied on women as "castration."
This force takes on the form of repression and social structures, which

The plot of PSYCHOANALYSIS and FAMILIAUSM: THE HOLY FAMILY is about a scenario where two characters, a boy and a girl, are involved in a masochistic fantasy scenario where the boy becomes a little girl on an erotic stage and the girl becomes a mother.
Both the boys and the girls in the scenario can experience pleasure from punishment only by becoming boys.
The scenario takes place in a village after a raid in Vietnam where the boys are punished by their instructor and have orgasms after being tortured.
In the film Hearts and Minds, Colonel Patton, the general's son, praises his guys for their love for their mothers, their fathers, and their country. This was during one of his visits to the front lines in the Vietnam war. The scene is memorable as he gives a speech on what it takes to be an American soldier in the Vietnam war.
There is not a single word about women

The concept of group fantasy was developed by the team at La Borde Clinic.
Group fantasy differs from individual fantasy in that it is plugged into and machined on the socius, not the parents or the mothers.
Individual fantasy is separate from the "symbolic" articulations that define a social field.
In the group fantasy concept, the individual fantasy apprehends imaginary qualities that confer it a kind of transcendence or immortality.
Jean Oury suggests that the collective fantasy constitutes an essential component in the process of self-identity formation because the group fantasy is "an instrument used by children to represent their personal and social world" (Oury, 1972, p. 18). This implies that the

The immortality conferred on the existing social order carries into the ego elements of repression, identification, "superegoization" and castration, resignation-desires (becoming a general; acquiring low, middle, or high rank), and resignation to dying in the service of this order.
The individual fantasy has a decisive importance over the death instinct.
In the individual fantasy, the drive to die is projected onto the outside and tured against the others (death to the foreigner, to those who are not of our own ranks).
The revolutionary pole of the group fantasy is visible on the«2 ANTI-OEDIPUS."
The group fantasy possesses the power to experience institutions as mortal entities. It is able to express itself in a world of death and destruction: the political community is, for example, regarded as a living being, and as one that can die. This expression is particularly evident when there is an imminent danger

Klossowski's group fantasy includes disjunctions, where individuals are discharged of their personal identities but not their singularities and enter into relations with others following communication proper to partial objects.
In his recent works, Klossowski has shown the inverse relationship between the economic law and psychic exchanges, which can lead to a subversion of the law and a deactualization of the institution itself.
The economic law establishes a perversion in the "psychic exchanges" of the group fantasy, which in turn can result in a subverting of the rule of the "singular state".
The group fantasy is divided into two types: an "anachronistic" and the "group fantasy".
Both types of fantasies are based on an "impersonal" exchange.
In the "anachronistic" group fantasy, individuals exchange goods or services with each other in accordance with their personal needs; the exchange is based on a "psychic transaction

The concept of group and individual fantasy suggests that there are two types of groups, subject-groups and subjugated groups.
The subject-group and submissive groups are constantly threatened with subjugation and can be capable of being forced to take on a revolutionary role.
According to Freudian analysis, the fantasy is divided into individual or pseudoindividual dimensions, which refer to the subjugated and subject- groups, respectively.
When we learn that the instructor, the teacher, the father, the colonel, the mother, and all the agents of sociocultural norms are also our oppressors, then it becomes possible for us to accept and embrace a revolutionary role in order to liberate ourselves from oppression.
The concept of group and individual fantasy, which is part of Freud's psychoanalysis

The concept of a duality between the subject of the statement (/‘enonce’) and the subject (/’enunciation’ of the enunciation is characteristic of the pseudoindividual fantasy.
This duality is artificial, derived, and supposes a direct relationship from the statement to the collective agents of enunciation in the group.
Institutional analysis tries to trace its path between the repressive asylum and the legalistic hospital on one hand and contractual psychoanalysis on the other.
In the context of institutional analysis, the psychoanalytic relationship models itself after the contractual relationship of the most traditional bourgeois medicine, including the feigned exclusion of a third party and the hypocritical role of the third party.
The therapeutic contract is based on the belief that it has been agreed upon by both parties.
This is an illusion because the subject (patient) is not in charge of his own life but the professional is; the patient does not have

"Analysis Terminable and Interminable" is the third and final text of Freud's "Analysis Finite, Analysis Infinite" (1937).
This text addresses the question of how to ward off the desire for a cure in psychoanalysis.
The concept of "cure" in this text is related to the concept of an analysis.
In this text, Freud questions the nature of the analysis process, including its termination, completion, and its self-perpetuation.
He questions if an analysis can be forewarned against ulterior conflicts, and if new conflicts can be awakened for a preventive purpose.
Freud begins by noting that psychoanalysis has always been limited to those who are willing to bear the "woe" of the analyst's "intimate relation." He claims that this is because "the analysis does not end with its

Sigmund Freud acknowledges that there are qualitative factors in the desiring-economy that present an obstacle to treatment.
According to Freud, these factors include the "rock" of castration, the "nonsymmetrical" face of the object of desire, and a "qualitative aptitude for conflict".
The second factor is a quantity of libido that does not branch into two variable forces corresponding to heterosexuality and homosexuality, creating irreducible oppositions in most people.
In PSYCHOANALYSIS and FAMILIALISM: The HOLY FAMILY: The Holy Family 85, Freud criticizes himself for not taking these factors into account.
Psychoanalysis is the only therapy that can overcome the obstacles created by a qualitative aptitude for conflict.
The "conflict" to which Freud refers does not mean a struggle against the therapist or his ideas, but rather the tension

According to Type II (liquidity, an extreme mobility of representations and an obsessional form), the analysis session is dominated by an unfettered, rapid, and almost torrential flow of representations.
In Type II, the patient could say the opposite of everything he is saying without affecting the analytic situation.
Type III (volatile, fluidity, and rapid) is the third type of analysis where the patient's words are fluid and the analysis slides off the couch like water off a duck's back.
The patient's interpretation is based on a chain of signifiers, not attached to the signified to which each of the signifiers refers.
A Type III analysis could take the form of an "exposition".
In Type IV (the analyst in the position of a priest), the relationship between the patient and the analyst assumes the nature of a holy union with the aim of achieving

AnTI-OEDIPUS is a psychoanalytic practice that manipulates the libido to prevent it from resisting therapy.
"Oedipal homosexuality" is the effect of oedipalization, which is accentuated within the artificial conditions of its exer- 
transference.
The pervert has invented other territorialities, more artificial and lunar than that of Oedipus.
When the pervert resists therapy, the flows of libido resist therapeu-
The resistance of the ego rather than the ego is felt by all of desiring-production.
We already knew that the schizo-phrenic or schizophrenic process consists in a series of transformations of the oedipal complex: when one of the two figures, Oedipus or his father, dies, the other (mother) takes over its function in

Oedipus and castration are depicted as a series of flows that can be plugged and plugged by Oedipos.
These flows include partial obje cts, disjunctive syntheses, breaks-flows that can project themselves onto a mythical space, poly vocal chains that can allow themselves to be biunivocalized, linearized, suspended from a signifier, and connective syntheses.
The use of these flows suggests that they can also be used in a personal and segregative context. This is not new, for there have always been ways in which people could choose how much of the world was accessible to them. For example, someone who chooses to stay within a certain city or country will experience some things and not others.

Oedipus is a character who haunts the perverted territorialities beyond the city of Kumba and possesses a desire for both lava and water.
The concept of schizophrenia is discussed in PSYCHOANALYSIS and FAMIUALISM: THE HOLY FAMILY, S7.
Schizophrenia is defined as a process and not a process itself.
It is caused by the frantic neuroticiza-tion to which we have been delivered and for which psychoanalysis has contributed.
This neuroticia results from the self-perpetuation of the process in a void, resulting in a horrible exasperation and the production of the psychosis.
In this context, it is important to understand that schizophrenia is not something like a disease as such but an expression of what is going on between people who are experiencing a very powerful anxiety about their innermost selves.
The concept of schizophrenia

Charlus is a character in "In Search of Lost Time".
Charlus has a deep affection for his old grandmother.
Proust's works include "Sodom and Gomorrah" (Cities of the Plain), "Sorcery and the City of Sodom" (Plain), and "Cities in the Landscape" (Landscape).
The novel "In Search of Lost Time", written by Proust, is a lengthy literary work that explores various themes and characters. One of the notable characters in the novel is Charlus

Albertine is depicted as a nebula formed from a group of girls.
Proust's work consists of a series of nebulae, statistical wholes, and collectives.
Within these neBulae or collectives, individuals figure under strange laws of lack, absence, asymmetry, exclusion, noncommunication, vice, and guilt.
Albertine's first kiss is depicted in an illustrative passage where her face shatters into molecular partial.
In Proust’s work, everything becomes blurred and comes apart in a molecular and pure multiplicity, where the partial objects, the "boxes," and the "vessels" all have positive determinations and enter into aberrant communication. The nebulae are a result of these non-communication, which is the cause of the lack and absence that create the collectives or the "nebulae" of Proust's work.
Albertine's first kiss is

Sodom and Gomorrah are two accursed and guilty series that bear witness to the same castration with two nonsuperimposable sides, Sodom and Sodom, each excluded from the other.
"Everyone is bisexual, everyone has two sexes, but they are partitioned, noncommunicating, and the man is merely the one in whom the male part of the female part is dominant.
The vegetal theme of "flowers" brings another message and another code: everyone is bisexual.
At the level of elementary combinations, at least two men and two women must intervene to create a multiplicity of transverse communications to establish the transverse communication.
One way or another, this means that the world does not consist of two sexes but of a series of double-sided sex pairs.
The male is not only the one in which the male part of the female part is dominant but also

In Proust's view of homosexuality, there are two types of homosexual identities: Oedipal, exclusive, and depressive, and anoedipal schizoid.
Proust describes a third type of homosexual identity, which he describes as an "elemental, molecular sense" of transsexuality.
In the first type of homosexuality there are those whose childhoods were timid and whose sensuality is more violent, who derive material pleasure from certain localizations.
The second group of homosexuals who express a preference for women, particularly those who seek out women who prefer men and who suggest young men, are described as having a strong preference for men.
According to the second group, women can offer the same sensuality that their male friends enjoy but in the opposite direction, with an increase in eroticism.
Proust argues that it is difficult for homosexual people to choose between two types of sexual behavior and that these preferences are often determined by

The synthesis of Oedipus is a synthesis of recording that sitsuates, on its surface of inscription, a definable and differentiable ego in relation to parental images serving as co-ordinates (mother and father).
There is a triangulation that implies a constituent prohibition that creates the differentiation between persons: prohibition of incest with the mother, prohibition against taking the father's place, and prohibition against homosexuality.
The Oedipal operation of the synthesis creates a differentia-70 ANTi-OEDIPUS that allows the creation of global persons in conformity with the prohibition.
According to this theory, global persons do not exist prior to the prohibitions that weigh on them and constitute the "Oedipus". In other words, according to this theory, the Oedipal operation is the point from which the universal person emerges.
The global person's existence is a result of the prohibition. It cannot be said that the prohibition is generated

The new images of individuals are the sister and the spouse, after the father and the mother.
The Oedipal triangle is a form of prohibition that has two forms: a negative form involving the mother and a positive form involving a sister.
In the positive form of the prohibition, the individual has a moral obligation to take as wife someone other than his sister and an obligation to keep his sister for someone else.
This positive form requires the exchange of a sister for a spouse or wife, as indicated by the statement 'I must give up my sister to a brother-in-law, receive my wife from a father-inlaw, and give up my wife to my mother-in-law'.
The negative form is that the individual has an obligation not to take his own mother in marriage. This prohibition may be stated as follows: "I will never marry or have children by myself

Kant draws upon centuries of scholastic reflection to define God as the principle of the disjunctive syllogism.
Kant also draws on centuries of Roman juridical reflection when he defines marriage as the tie that makes a person the owner of the sexual organs of another person.
In a religious manual of sexual casuistry, there are restrictions on the types of connections that can be tolerated within the regime for the pairing of people.
These restrictions include those that determine what may be appropriated from the body of the wife.
A society that allows an infantile stage of sexual promiscuity to subsist until the age of consent is one that regulates the social production of children.
The right not to have oneself impregnated by a person who does not have the legal right to do so is the right not to be made pregnant by someone else's biological child.
This is the case even if an adolescent girl

Melanie Klein posits a concept of a triangle that creates and destroys the factitious unity of a possessive or proprietary ego (anoedipal sexuality).
This triangle takes form in the parental use and reproduces itself in the conjugal use.
The triangle is created by a triangulation that involves the destruction of the ego and its connections.
In Melanie Klein's concept of the triangle, desire machines and flows through the body without organs, creating and destroying the ego.
According to Melanie Klein, the schizoid partial object is related to a whole that prepares for the advent of the complete object in the depressive phase.
The child creates an imaginary friend because it wishes to be with its own mother and not with the father. The imaginary friend serves as a substitute, but the child does not want to destroy his or her own ego by leaving the mother's

In Lacanism, the concept of a "phallus" or "law" is used to designate the signifier that distributes the effects of meaning throughout a chain and introduces exclusions there.
This signifier acts as the "formal cause" of the formation of the triangle in Lacanism.
According to Lacanism's interpretation of the oedipal, the formula 3 + 
1 is the One of the transcendent phallus or law, which is responsible for forming the triangles.
Lacanism's concept of the "triangulation" is based on the idea that the terms "considered" would not take the form of the terms without this signifier.
The concept of triangulation is used in Lacan's analysis of language and speech to explain how the signifying act functions through a series of triangles.
This is based on the fact that it is necessary for each person to have the same knowledge about

According to M. C. and Edmond Ortigues, Oedipe africain (Ch.3, reference note 22), at least four terms are required for the existence of a structure in the familial institution or Oedipus complex.
The conversion of sexuality into the Oedipal framework involves the projection of all the symbolic elements into the same major signifier.
This conversion involves the elimination of all symbolic elements and the identification of sexuality as one of the sexes.
Sexuality is given its full meaning by the reference to the penis.
All previous history is recast in a new version in the light of the concept of castration.
In the Oedipus complex, it is the phallus that has been removed and replaced with the mother's body or, more precisely, her genitals which have taken on the symbolic functions formerly played by the penis.
The

According to Freud, the concept of castration and oedipalization creates an illusion that real desiring-production is answerable to higher formations that integrate it, subject it to transcendent laws, and make it serve a higher social and cultural production.
Psychoanalysis is responsible for the transformation of the unconscious.
In Freud's view, the pre-oedipal stage is a stage that must be surmounted and organized in the direction of an evolutive integration (toward the depressive position under the reign of the complete object) or a structural integration (Toward the position of a despotic signifier, under the rule of the phallus).
The child's "oedipal crisis" is often associated with the emergence of a sexual desire for one's father, and by extension, his mother. This occurs during the latency stage of psychosexual development, when the libido moves

The goal of psychoanalysis is to promote the conversion of the unconscious to Oedipus, form and content.
This conversion is promoted by making a global and specific use of connective syntheses.
The use of these syntheses is transcendent and implies a first paralogism in the psychoanalysis process.
Kant proposed a critical revolution to distinguish the legitimate and illegitimate uses of the syntheses of consciousness.
In this critical revolution, Kant denounced the transcendent use of syntheses such as appeared in metaphysics.
According to Kant, psychoanalysis has its metaphysics and its name is Oedreversion. The use of the oedresis in psychoanalysis is legitimate because it promotes a first paralogism that leads to the conversion of the unconscious (Oedipus) to form and content.
The transcendent use of syntheses

Oedipus slips into the disjunctive syntheses of the Desiring-recording and imposes an ideal of a certain restrictive or exclusive use on its characters that is identical with the form of triangula-tion.
The concept of the prohibition of incest is related to the concept of a differentiating function of the Disjunctive Synthesis.
In this context, incest is defined as a form of "either/or" in the differentiating functions of the disjunctctive synthesis.
OedIPus's character is unable to distinguish between "being parent or child" and "being daddy, mommy, or child".
The use of incest by Oedipus can be understood from the point of view of the differentiations that are made in a series of successive syntheses. In particular, the synthesis that leads to "the father" (the first generation

The disjunctive syllogism is a concept in Kant's definition of God that posits God as the a priori priori creator of the world.
The action characteristic of Oedipal recording is the introduction of an exclusive, restrictive, and negative use of the disjunction.
Kant's humor makes God into a master of a syllogistic.
Oedipus is a powerful force in shaping our understanding of God.
Even familial neuroses, such as familial personality disorder, can use the use of this disjunct.
Schizophrenia reveals an extra-Oedipal lesson about the power of disjunctions.
The "I am" statement may be used to create a negative syllogism by using a second "I" that is not associated with the first I.
A disjunction can be used as a device for making a statement

Albert Desire is a schizophrenic who places himself on both sides of the parallel series of the masculine and the feminine.
Jayet identifies himself as "Mat Albert 5416 ricu-le sultan remain vesin," "Mat Desire 1001 ric-la sultane romaine vesine," and "MatAlbert 5416-the insane Roman sultaness".
The disjunctions in the disjunction where Jayet places himself are the terminal point of a distance over which he glides.
The schizophrenic is not dead or alive.
Likable, and charmingly so. He has no pretensions to be anything else, but he nevertheless has his share of charm.
There's an interesting juxtaposition in the book between how Jayet presents himself on stage (the "Mat")

Schreber identifies as a transsexual.
He is not bisexual, intersexual, or intersexual.
In his transformation into a woman, Schreber opens up and releases many singularities, some of which he intended to exclude.
The disjunction created by his transformation is inclusive and nonrestrictive, resulting in a space where Molloy and Moran no longer designate persons and singularities flocking from all sides.
This space is a free disjunctions where the differential positions persist in their entirety and take on a free quality, but they are all inhabited by a faceless and transpositional subject.
Schreber's transformation creates an open space that allows for the intermingling of identities and singularities which results in a "trans" or trans-identity.
The process is not about creating an identity but rather about opening
