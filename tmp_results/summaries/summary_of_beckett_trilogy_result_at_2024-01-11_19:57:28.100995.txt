Molloy is living in her mother's room now and doesn't know how she got there. Molloy was helped by a man who gives her money and takes away pages every week. The man who takes the pages and gives money to the pages is the same one who always gives the pages back with the previous week's pages. Despite the money and the pages being taken away by the man every week, despite not working for money and not having any money left, she doesn't sleep in her room and has her room to herself. She has no idea how to work and doesnâ€™t know how to do it. She wants to say her good-byes and finish dying, but her family doesn't want her to.
