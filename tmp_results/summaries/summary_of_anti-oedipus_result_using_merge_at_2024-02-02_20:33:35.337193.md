The concept of "desiring-machines" in psychoanalysis has been reduced to parental images in the book "THE DESIRING-MACHINES | 45."
The concept is based on the concept of Oedipus, a character from Greek mythology.
The logic of the desiring-production process is reduced to the logic of parental images.
Partial objects are not just the result of the desires that they represent in the child's mind, but also reflect the power dynamics between parent and child.
Desires are not only about what we want or need, but also how we understand our place in the world.
In the case of the parents, there is an important distinction between how a

The conversation takes place in a house where the child's parents are present all the time.
The child explores the house using one of his legs as an oar, exploring the electrical outlets, the kitchen, the study, and running toy cars back and forth.
In this scenario, the child perceives everything he touches as a representative of his parents' bodies.
Ray Bradbury describes the nursery as a space where the child is given the freedom to explore his own thoughts and ideas while interacting with objects in the environment. This activity encourages curiosity and imagination.
The child explores a variety of items in the nursery, including toys, books, and art supplies. He uses these objects to express his creativity and engage in imaginative

The concept of the Oedipal triangulation suggests that desire is diverted into a narrow channel and forms an inscription within a process of inscription.
The child re/ates the breast as a partial object to the person of his mother and constantly watches the expression on his mother's face.
In this context, the term "relate" does not designate a natural productive relationship but rather a relation within the field of the social bond that is already constituted.
The child relates to the signifiers, but these signifiers are not simply inscribed on a tabula rasa. They are already there, already functioning, and already constellating meanings.
The triangulation then becomes not just between the mother, father

The concept of the unconscious is discussed in the context of childhood.
Artaud, a Cartesian thinker, suggests that the unconscious has no parents and produces itself within the identity of nature and man.
According to Artaud, the unconscious discovers independence from its parents through an indefinite parental regression.
D.H. Lawrence had reservations about psychoanalysis, perceiving it as restricting sexuality and limiting its potential for liberation.
The influence of Freud on modern culture is seen in terms of his reinterpretation of the unconscious and sexuality, particularly with regards to the Oedipus complex.
Carl Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious has been seen as a precursor to modern-day New Age philosophy.

The relationship between madness and the family can be traced back to a development that affected bourgeois society in the 19th century.
The family was entrusted with functions that became the measuring rod of the responsibility of its members and their possible guilt.
According to Foucault, psychoanalysis is carrying out the task begun by ninete enth-century psycholo gy by developing a moralized, familial discourse of mental illness.
This discourse has led to the over-medicalization of childhood, adolescence and adulthood, making it impossible for individuals to grow up without being judged as mentally ill or sick, even when they do not suffer from any psychiatric disorders.
Moreover, this discourse has created an environment in which madness is seen as

The structure of the Oedipus (3 + 1) is a system of positions and functions that can distribute desire, its object, and the law across a given domain.
The distinction between the Imaginary and the Symbolic* allows the emergence of an Oedipal structure that does not conform to the variable figure of those who occupy them in a given social or pathological formation.
Structural interpretation is the analytic method that enables us to recognize this distribution without reducing it to a predetermined category, thus maintaining its autonomy and flexibility.
In this way, the Oedipus becomes an operative model that can be used to describe a variety of structures from society and culture to politics and economics.
It allows for understanding

Jacques Lacan and Laplanche and Pontalis are questioning the Oedipalization approach to psycho-analysis.
They question whether psycho-analytic approaches to Oedipus are aggressive or schizophrenic.
Lacan proposes a schizophrenic approach to the domain of the unconscious and the sociohistorical domain.
Laplanche suggests that Freud discovered the OEDipus complex in 1897 but that it was not until the 1920s that a new formulation emerged, which he calls “Oedipalization”.
According to him, Oedipalization is an attempt to find meaning and value in the human experience by attributing significance to events or situations, especially those involving

Sigmund Freud and his first analysts discover a world of free syntheses where everything is possible: endless connections, nonexclusive disjunctions, nonspecific objects and flows, and neurobiologico-desiring-machines.
The discovery of the productive unconscious has two correlates: a direct confrontation between desiring-production and social production, and the repression that the social machine exercises on the process of desiring-production. The question is how to break with this repression.
In the first series of seminars (Seminar I), we will study some psycho-socio-political situations where the conflict has been waged in the most direct manner, as in the case of the Bol

Freud's theory of psychoanalysis is based on the classical order of representation.
The psychoanalysis process involves the introduction of a third element, the desiring-machine, which has the co-ordinates of the Desiring-Production.
Desiring-machines are a key element of the psychoanalytic process.
Oedipus is a key figure in psychoanalysis's development, as his story exemplifies Freud's theory of repression.

Freud believed that sexual desire and its repression were central to human behavior, and that these desires had been repressed since birth. He theorized that the psyche was divided into three components: the ego (the conscious part), the superego (

Skereber's analysis was not in vivo, but has significant value from the point of view of practice.
The history of Freud's work has a similar history to that of Capital, with its enchanted, "miraculated" world.
In his third text, "Three Texts of Freud," Freud explores the concept of paternal delirium, a theme of his work.
While there is no doubt that the father's mental illness can be as destructive to an infant and family as the mother's, Skereber's analysis was not in vivo, but has significant value from the point of view of practice.
The history of Freud's work has a similar history to that of Capital,

Freud believes that psychoanalysis has a monotony and encounters the father everywhere, including in Flechsig, God, and in the sun.
He believes that the father returns constantly in hidden and least recognizable guises and expresses forces or mechanisms eternally active in the unconscious.
Freud invokes two arguments in his analysis: a sexual argument about the union of sexuality and the familial bond, and an economic argument involving the child's desire for its parent's wealth and power. The psychological effects of these encounters are often characterized as profound anxiety, depression, or psychosis.
The father-son relationship is one of Freud’s most

In Marx's view, denying God is only a secondary thing to put man in God's place.
According to Freud's analysis, the person who denies God is no longer required to rely on the mediation of myth and assumes an autoproduction of the unconscious.
Freud connects sexuality to the familial complex, making Oedipus into the criterion of analysis and the test of orthodoxy.
In a Freudian view, the family is the fundamental unit of society, and it is in the family where sexuality is produced and organized.
For Marx, religion was not just about morality or ethics, but about social organization itself, as God becomes the mediator between people's interests and the economic system.

Sigmund Freud's analysis of the psychology of the two sexes, the girls and the boys, suggests that there is a common theme of the father absent in the first phase of the girls' and boys' development.
Something common to the two genders is required to create a series of disjunctions that distributes the lack in two nonsymmetrical series.
Both girls and boys express a need for the Father but the ways they manifest this need are different from one another.  Girls tend to express their longing for a father figure through their romantic relationships, whereas boys express it more directly.
For both genders, though, there is a fundamental lack of an emotional connection with the absent father in early childhood. Freud's theory

According to Freud, bisexuality is a form of "castration".
Sigmund Freud developed the concept of bisexuality, but he was unable to give this concept the analytical position and extension it required.
The concept of the female sexual organ was developed following Melanie Klein's attempt to define it in terms of positive characteris- tics.
Freud opposed the idea of the sexual organ as a single, localized entity because he believed that sexuality is more widespread than this.
He saw it as being connected to many other aspects of personality and behaviour, including aggression, creativity, and morality.
Sigmund Freud's theory of bisexuality was based on his belief that the
