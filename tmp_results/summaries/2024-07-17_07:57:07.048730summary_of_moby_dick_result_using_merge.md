grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and

whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings and

"But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck,

possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality

air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the

 The most important of all the things he did in that crow’s-nest,
is to place a little telescope in the rack, and to keep it on the

horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the
sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so

that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any

whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer

"The whale’s eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their
visual power, so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain;
the peculiar position of the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they
are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between them like a
great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must
thoroughly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts.
The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and
another distinct picture on that side; while all between must be


 It is a curious and most puzzling
question, whether it is possible to see two objects, at the same time,
in the light of one eye, and in the light of the other. We have seen
that the eye is a very powerful instrument, and that it is capable of
exceeding the powers of the mind. But, if we look at the light of one
eye, and the light of the other, we find that the eye is not capable of
exceeding the powers of the mind; and, indeed, it is impossible for the
eye to see two objects at the same time.

"The whale had a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known
his fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained
up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, but that choking respiration
through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable;
while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail,
there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.

 But when the German harpooneer, in the second fury,
saw the first of the three whales, he was so overcome by the
impulsive force of the blast, that he had to run for his life, and the
three whales were saved.

it is a very large animal, and that it is a whale, then we have a
reasonable estimate of the weight of a whale, and the weight of a ship,
which is only one-fifth of the weight of a whale. And if we suppose

"No, no, no!" cried the whale, as he rushed up to the bow, as if he

he was about to strike the bow, as if he had been struck by a sudden
blow. "I’m going to the sea!" he cried, as he was about to strike the

"The crew, however, were not in a state of panic, for the
whale had been carried to the shore by the boat, and was not
underway, and was thus protected by the cord.

 But the old whales, as they are
frequently found in the waters of the North Sea, have a very different
condition. They are the most buoyant of all the whales, and their
pants are not so much the result of their lard as of their weight.
They are, in fact, the result of a very special state of health,
which is, in fact, a state of health, in which the whale is not
sinking, but is buoyant. It is the condition of the whale, not of
the fish, that is the cause of the sinking of the Sperm Whale

 But in the Sperm Whale, when he has gone down,
the buoys are not so easily found, and the whale is not so easily
sunk. The right whale is a very dangerous animal, and is liable to
accidents. The right whale is not a whale of the same species as the
left whale, but is a whale of the same species as the right whale.

The ambergris of Nantucket is a very curious substance, and so
important as an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born
Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of
Commons on that subject. For at that time, and indeed until a
relatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber

but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are
quite distinct. For amber, though at times found

it from the whale which he had seen. It is true that the Frenchman

This is a very simple, but very effective, way of thinking about
the world around you.

world of man. If you are not a man, you are a man, and you must
know the world of man. If you are a man, you must know the world
of man.
