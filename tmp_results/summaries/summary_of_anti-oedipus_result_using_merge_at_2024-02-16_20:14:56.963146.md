Desiring-MACHINES by Michel Foucault and Mark Seem is a collection of short pieces of literature.
Desired-Production I is a synthesis of three synthesises: the connective synthesis or production of production, the disjunctive synthesis or the production of recording, and the conjunctive synthesis of consumption-consummation, which describes the schizophrenic and celibate.
A Materialist Psychiatry presents a materialist view of the world, focusing on the differences in regime between social production and materialist psychiatry.

Desiring-MACHINES by Michel Foucault and Mark Seem is an anthology comprising short literary pieces that explore themes related to desire, machines, and production processes. This collection combines various perspectives and approaches to analyze the intersection between technology, human behavior, and societal structures.

On the other hand, Desired-Production I represents a tripartite synthesis encompassing three distinct concepts: connective synthesis or production of production, disjunctive synthesis or recording production, and conjunctive synthesis of consumption-consummation, which delineates schizophrenic and celibate perspectives.

A Materialist Psychiatry offers a materialistic viewpoint on the world, primarily focusing on the differences between social production regimes and materialist psychiatry practices.

The Desiring-machines are machines and there are three modes of break: flows and selection from flows, chains or codes, and attachments from them.
The Imperialism of Oedipus 51 describes the Oedipal turning-point in psychoanalysis.
Three Texts of Freud 56 discusses the flattening-out of Judge Schreber's "delirium" and how psychoanalysis is still pious.
In The Whole and Its Parts 42, Freud discusses the status of multiplicities, the partial objects, and a critique of the "Oedipal mystification".
The Connective Synthesis of Production 68 describes the use of the family, global and specific, partial and non-specific

In the given passage, several titles are mentioned that discuss various aspects of psychoanalysis. These titles include:
1. "Desiring-machines" - This term seems to be referring to a concept related to Freudian theory and its modes of break which involve flows, chains or codes, and attachments from them.
2. "The Imperialism of Oedipus 51" - This title refers to an analysis of the Oedipal turning point in psychoanalysis. It appears to be exploring how the Oedipus complex plays a significant role within Freudian theory.
3. "Three Texts of Freud 56" - This work discusses the flattening-out of Judge Schreber's "delirium" and how psychoanalysis remains pious despite this occurrence. It seems to be analyzing the impact of a specific case on Freudian theory.
4. "The Whole and Its Parts 42" - This title refers to Freud's discussion about the status of multiplicities, partial objects, and a critique of the "Oedipal mystification." It appears to be focusing on different aspects within psychoanalysis involving multiple entities or elements.
5. "The Connective Synthesis of Production 68" - This title describes the use of family units (global and specific), both partial and non-specific attachments in production processes related to Freudian theory. It seems to be exploring how families play a role within psychoanalysis concepts.

The first paralogism of psychoanalysis is the Oedipal double-bind, where Oedipus wins at every turn.
The Conjunctive Synthesis of Consumption-Consummation 84 describes its two uses, segregative and biunivocal, nomadic and polyvocal.
Desiring-production and the investment of social production are paralogistic topics in psychoanalysis.
A Recapitulation of the Three Syntheses 106 describes the meaning of "belief" and "meaning" in the context of desiring.
"Desiring is revolutionary and a revolutionary agent of psychic repression, but it is not psychoanalysis that invents Oed
The given text seems to be discussing abstract concepts related to psychoanalysis and its various theories or approaches. It mentions different terms such as "paralogism," "Oedipal double-bind," "Conjunctive Synthesis," "Consumption-Consummation," "desiring-production," "social production," "psychoanalysis," "Recapitulation," and "desiring." These terms indicate a complex analysis of psychological theories and their implications.

The text appears to focus on how these concepts relate to each other within the context of psychoanalysis. It talks about an initial paralogism called the Oedipal double-bind where Oedipus seems to be winning every turn in some way related to psychoanalytic understanding. Then it moves on to discuss two uses of Conjunctive Synthesis named segregative and biunivocal, nomadic, and polyvocal. These terms seem to describe different aspects or perspectives within the realm of psychoanalysis theory.

Desiring-production and the investment of social production are also mentioned as paralogistic topics in psychoanalysis. This suggests that these concepts play a significant role in understanding psychological dynamics from various angles.

Finally, the text refers to "A Recapitulation of the Three Syntheses" which describes the meaning of "belief" and "meaning" in relation to desiring within psychoanalytic contexts. It also states that it is not psychoanalysis itself that invents Oed but rather recognizes its existence as a conceptual element.



The characters involved in the conversation are: "The painter Turner", "The Inscribing Socius," "The Primitive Territorial Machine," and "The Problem of Oedipus".
Turner is depicted as a painter.
The conversation involves the movement of deterritoriali-zation and territorialities.
In the context of the conversation, the characters are referred to as "savages, barbarians, and citizens."
The socius is a social machine that codes flows and creates a memory for man.
This socius can be coded by investment and disinvestment of "organs".
Incest is discussedThe intricate dialogue revolves around the notion of deterritorialization and territorialities among various entities. In this setting, Turner represents a painter while maintaining an identity as a character. The Socius, referred to as 'The Inscribing Socius,' embodies a social machine capable of coding flows and constructing memory for humanity. This Socius can be altered through investments and disinvestments in "organs."

As the conversation progresses, it becomes evident that different characters symbolize diverse societal groups: savages, barbarians, and citizens. These terms reflect varying degrees of civilization or cultural development within the context of deterritorialization and territorialities.

Incest is mentioned as part of a broader theme, potentially connecting to 'The Problem of Oedipus,' which may refer to a literary piece exploring familial relationships and taboo dynamics. However, without further context provided in the conversation itself, it remains unclear how these elements are intertwined within this particular discussion about deterritorialization and territorialities.

Culturalists and university-salists share common postulates.
Nietzsche discusses the death of territorial systems.
The Barbarian Despotic Machine 192 describes the full body of the despot, including a new alliance and direct filiation.
Territorial Representation 184 describes the five postulates of the "exchangist conception" of the territorial system.
Barbarian or Imperial Representation 200 describes the elements of incest and the concept of a deterritorialized sign.
In this passage, different concepts are mentioned with titles starting with "The" followed by a noun. These titles seem to be referring to various philosophical ideas or theories discussed in academic contexts. Let's break down each title to understand their meanings better:

1. Culturalists and university-salists share common postulates - This suggests that culturalists (people who study culture) and university scholars have similar beliefs or principles regarding certain aspects.

2. Nietzsche discusses the death of territorial systems - Friedrich Nietzsche is a philosopher known for his critique of traditional values and ideas. Here, he seems to be talking about how territorial systems (possibly referring to political boundaries) are being replaced or transformed in some way.

3. The Barbarian Despotic Machine 192 describes the full body of the despot, including a new alliance and direct filiation - This title appears to discuss a concept related to despots (authoritarian rulers), possibly focusing on their "Barbarian" nature or characteristics. It mentions a new alliance and direct lineage as additional elements in this context.

4. Territorial Representation 184 describes the five postulates of the "exchangist conception" of the territorial system - This title refers to a representation of territories, discussing specific principles or beliefs related to their functioning. The term "exchangist conception" suggests an alternative way of understanding territorial systems.

5. Barbarian or Imperial Representation 200 describes the elements of incest and the concept of a deterritorialized sign - This title seems to explore representations involving barbarians (possibly referring to their behavior) as well as imperial systems. It mentions incestuous relationships and the idea of signs

"The transformation of surplus value into a surplus value of code."
"The two forms of money, the two inscriptions, and the falling tendency of money."
The capitalist State, its relationship with the Urstaat, and its relationship to the class.
"Deterritorialization and re-territorializations: their relationship and relationship of the three great social machines: the territorial, the despotic and despotic.
Capitalist Representation 240 contains elements such as "the figures or schizzes-flows" and "the difference between a code and an axiomatic".
"Human surplus value" is discussed in the text.The given excerpts seem to touch upon various concepts related to economics, politics, sociology, and philosophy. Each point mentioned can be explored further to understand its significance within these fields.

1. Transformation of surplus value into a surtomarketingbrandoncode surplus value of code:
This statement refers to the idea that economic surplus (profit or excess wealth) is converted into something else - in this case, "surplus value of code." It's likely discussing how information or knowledge becomes commodified and generates value within a capitalist system. This transformation could be related to intellectual property rights, where ideas and innovations become commercial assets.

2. Two forms of money, two inscriptions, falling tendency of money:
This triplet seems to discuss different aspects of money within an economic context. The "two forms of money" might refer to physical currency versus digital currency or credit instruments like checks and bonds. The term "two inscriptions" could be related to how money is represented in different formats - written, numerical, symbolic representations. Lastly, the "falling tendency of money" may be referring to the decline in purchasing power over time due to inflation or devaluation of currency.

3. Capitalist State, Urstaat relationship, class relationship:
This segment appears to address the dynamics between different societal structures and classes within a capitalist framework. The Urstaat could be an alternative term for 'primitive accumulation,' referring to the initial stages of capitalism where surplus value is extracted from laborers without fair compensation. The relationship between these entities and classes implies exploring how these systems interact with each other while affecting social hierarchies and distributions of wealth.
