I am in my mother’s room.It’s I who live there now.I don’t 
know how I got tl^pre.Perhaps in an ambulance, certainly a vehicle 
of some kind.I was helped.I’d never have got there alone.There’s 
this man who comes every week.Perhaps I got here thanks to him.He says not.He gives me money and takes away the pages.So many 
pages, so much money.Yes, I work now, a little like I used to,

have one somewhere.But I think not.He would be old now, nearly 
as old as myself.It was a little chambermaid.It wasn’t true love.The true love was in another.We’ll come to that.Her name?I’ve 
forgotten it again.It seems to me sometimes that I even knew my 
son, that I helped him.Then I tell myself it’s impossible.It’s impos- 
sible I could ever have helped anyone.I’ve forgotten how to spell
