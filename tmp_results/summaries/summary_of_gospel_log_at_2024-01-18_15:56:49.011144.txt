An examination of the Christian teaching: first according to its interpretation by the Orthodox Russo-Greek Church, then according to its interpretation by the Church in general—by the Apostles, the Councils, the so-called Fathers of the Church—and an exposure of what is false in those interpretations.An examination of Christian teaching not according to those interpretations but solely according to what has come down to us of Christ's teaching, as ascribed to him in the Gospels.An exposition of the real meaning of Christ's teaching, the reasons why it has been perverted, and the consequences to which it should lead.From the third of those parts the present account has been compiled.The harmonization of the four Gospels has been in accord with the sense of the teaching.In making it I hardly had to digress from the order in which it is set down in the Gospels, so that there are not more but fewer transpositions of the verses than in most of the concordances known to me, or than in Grechulévich's arrangement of the Four Gospels.In my treatment of the Gospel of John there are no transpositions, but everything follows the order of the original.The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters (or six if each two be united) came about of itself from the sense of the teaching.This is the meaning of those chapters:Man is the son of an infinite source: a son of that Father not by the flesh but by the spirit.Therefore man should serve that source in spirit.The life of all men has a divine origin.It alone is holy.Therefore man should serve that source in the life of all men.Such is the will of the Father.The service of the will of that Father of life gives life.Therefore the gratification of one's own will is not necessary for life.Temporal life is food for the true life.Therefore the true life is independent of time: it is in the present.Summarization models summary:
