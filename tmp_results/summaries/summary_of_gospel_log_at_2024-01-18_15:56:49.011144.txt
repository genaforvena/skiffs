An examination of the Christian teaching: first according to its interpretation by the Orthodox Russo-Greek Church, then according to its interpretation by the Church in general—by the Apostles, the Councils, the so-called Fathers of the Church—and an exposure of what is false in those interpretations.An examination of Christian teaching not according to those interpretations but solely according to what has come down to us of Christ's teaching, as ascribed to him in the Gospels.An exposition of the real meaning of Christ's teaching, the reasons why it has been perverted, and the consequences to which it should lead.From the third of those parts the present account has been compiled.The harmonization of the four Gospels has been in accord with the sense of the teaching.In making it I hardly had to digress from the order in which it is set down in the Gospels, so that there are not more but fewer transpositions of the verses than in most of the concordances known to me, or than in Grechulévich's arrangement of the Four Gospels.In my treatment of the Gospel of John there are no transpositions, but everything follows the order of the original.The division of the Gospel into twelve chapters (or six if each two be united) came about of itself from the sense of the teaching.This is the meaning of those chapters:Man is the son of an infinite source: a son of that Father not by the flesh but by the spirit.Therefore man should serve that source in spirit.The life of all men has a divine origin.It alone is holy.Therefore man should serve that source in the life of all men.Such is the will of the Father.The service of the will of that Father of life gives life.Therefore the gratification of one's own will is not necessary for life.Temporal life is food for the true life.Therefore the true life is independent of time: it is in the present.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
Time is an illusion of life; life in the past and in the future conceals from men the true life of the present.Therefore man should strive to destroy the illusion of the temporal life of the past and future.True life is life in the present, common to all men and manifesting itself in love.Therefore he who lives by love in the present, through the common life of all men, unites with the Father, the source and foundation of life.So each two chapters are related as cause and effect.In addition to these twelve chapters an introduction from the first chapter of the Gospel of John is added, in which the writer of that Gospel speaks, in his own name, as to the meaning of the whole teaching, and a conclusion from the same writer's Epistle (written probably before the Gospel) containing a general deduction from all that precedes.These two parts do not form an essential part of the teaching, but though they both might be omitted without losing the sense of the teaching (the more so as they come in the name of John and not of Jesus)—I have retained them because in a straightforward understanding of Christ's teaching these parts, confirming one another an the whole, furnish, in contradiction to the queer interpretation of the Churches, the plainest indication of the meaning that should be ascribed to the teaching.At the beginning of each chapter, besides a brief indication of its subject, I have given the words which correspond to that chapter from the prayer Jesus taught his disciples.When I had finished my work I found to my surprise and joy that the Lord's Prayer is nothing but a very concise expression of the whole teaching of Jesus in the very order in which I had arranged the chapters, and that each phrase of the prayer corresponds to the meaning and sequence of the chapters:1.Our Father, Man is a son of God.2.Which art in Heaven, God is the infinite spiritual source of life.3.Hallowed be Thy Name, May this source of life be held holy.

4.Thy Kingdom come, May his power be realized in all men.5.Thy will be done, as in heaven, May the will of this infinite source be fulfilled as it is in himself,6. so on earth.so also in the bodily life.7.Give us our daily bread Temporal life is the food of the true life.8. each day.True life is in the present.9.And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.And let not the mistakes and errors of the past hide that true life from us.10.And lead us not into temptation, And may they not lead us into delusion,11.But deliver us from evil, And so there shall be no evil.12.For thine is the kingdom the power, and the glory.And may thy power, and strength, and wisdom, prevail.In the full exposition, in the third part, everything in the Gospels is set down without any omissions.But in the present rendering the following are omitted: the conception and birth of John the Baptist, his imprisonment and death, the birth of Jesus, his genealogy, his mother's flight with him to Egypt; his miracles at Cana and Caperaum; the casting out of the devils; the walking on the sea; the blasting of the fig-tree; the healing of the sick; the raising of the dead; the resurrection of Christ himself, and the references to prophecies fulfilled by his life.Those passages are omitted in the present short exposition because, containing nothing of the teaching but only describing events that took place before, during, or after the period in which Jesus taught, they complicate the exposition.Those verses, however they may be understood, do not contain either contradiction or confirmation of the teaching.Their sole significance for Christianity was to prove the divinity of Jesus to those who did not believe in it.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
But for one who understands that a story of miracles is unconvincing, and who also doubts that the divinity of Jesus is asserted in his teaching, those verses drop away of themselves as superfluous.In the larger work every deviation from the ordinary version, as well as every inserted comment and every omission, is explained and justified by comparison of the different variants of the Gospels, by examination of contexts, and by philological and other considerations.In the present brief rendering all such proofs and refutations of the false understanding of the Churches, as well as the detailed notes and references, are omitted, on the ground that however exact and correct the discussions of each separate passage may be, they cannot carry conviction as to the true understanding of the teaching.The justness of the understanding of the teaching is better proved not by the discussion of particular passages but by its own unity, clarity, simplicity and completeness, and by its accordance with the inner feeling of all who seek the truth.In respect of all the divergences of my rendering from the Church's authorized text, the reader should not forget that the customary conception that the four Gospels with all their verses and syllables are sacred books is a very gross error.The reader should remember that Jesus never wrote any book himself, as Plato, Philo, or Marcus Aurelius did; nor even, like Socrates, transmitted his teaching to educated men, but that he spoke to many uneducated men and only long after his death did people begin to write down what they had heard about him.The reader should remember that there were very many such accounts from among which the Churches selected first three Gospels and then one more, and that in selecting those best Gospels—as the proverb, 'There is no stick without knots' says—they had to take in many knots with what they selected from the whole mass of writings about Christ, and that there are many passages in the canonical Gospels just as poor as in the rejected apocryphal ones.

The reader should remember that it is the teaching of Christ which may be sacred, but certainly not any definite number of verses and syllables, and that certain verses picked out from here to there cannot become sacred merely because people say they are.Moreover the reader should remember that these selected Gospels are also the work of thousands of different human brains and hands, that they have been selected, added to, and commented on, for centuries, that all the copies that have come down to us from the fourth century are written in continuous script without punctuation, so that even after the fourth and fifth centuries they have been subject to very diverse readings, and that there are not less than fifty thousand such variations of the Gospels.This should all be borne in mind by the reader, that he may not be misled by the customary view that the Gospels in their present form have come to us direct from the Holy Ghost.The reader should remember that far from it being blameworthy to discard useless passages from the Gospels and elucidate some passages by others, it is on the contrary irrational not to do so and to hold a certain number of verses and syllables as sacred.On the other hand I beg readers to remember that if I do not regard the Gospels as sacred books that have come down to us from the Holy Ghost, even less do I regard them as mere historical monuments of religious literature.I understand the theological as well as the historical view of the Gospels, but regard them myself differently, and so I beg the reader not to be confused either by the church view or by the historical view customary in our day among educated people, neither of which do I hold.I regard Christianity neither as an inclusive divine revelation nor as an historical phenomenon, but as a teaching which gives us the meaning of life.Summarization models summary:

Merging and summarizing: 
I was led to Christianity neither by theological nor historical investigations but by this—that when I was fifty years old, having asked myself and all the learned men around me what I am and what is the meaning of my life, and received the answer that I am a fortuitous concatenation of atoms and that life has no meaning but is itself an evil, I fell into despair and wanted to put an end to my life; but I remembered that formerly in childhood when I believed, life had a meaning for me, and that for the great mass of men about me who believe and are not corrupted by riches life has a meaning; and I doubted the validity of the reply given me by the learned men of my circle and I tried to understand the reply Christianity gives to those who live a real life.And I began to seek Christianity in the Christian teaching that guides such men's lives.I began to study the Christianity which I saw applied in life and to compare that applied Christianity with its source.The source of Christian teaching is the Gospels, and in them I found the explanation of the spirit which guides the life of all who really live.But together with this source of the pure water of life I found, wrongfully united with it, mud and slime which had hidden its purity from me: by the side of and bound up with the lofty Christian teaching I found a Hebrew and a Church teaching alien to it.I was in the position of a man who receives a bag of stinking dirt, and only after long struggle and much labor finds that amid that dirt lie priceless pearls; and he understands that he was not to blame for disliking the stinking dirt, and that those who have collected and preserved these pearls together with the dirt are also not to blame but deserve love and respect.

I did not know the light and had thought there was no light of truth to be found in life, but having convinced myself that men live by that light alone, I began to look for its source and found it in the Gospels, despite the false Church interpretations.And on reaching that source of light I was dazzled by it, and found full replies to my questions as to the meaning of my own life and that of others—answers in full agreement with those I knew of from other nations, but which in my opinion were superior to them all.I was looking for an answer to the question of life and not to theological or historical questions, and so for me the chief question was not whether Jesus was or was not God, or from whom the Holy Ghost proceeded and so forth, and equally unimportant and unnecessary was it for me to know when and by whom each Gospel was written and whether such and such a parable may, or may not, be ascribed to Christ.What was important to me was this light which has enlightened mankind for eighteen hundred years and which enlightened and still enlightens me; but how to name the source of that light, and what materials he or someone else had kindled, did not concern me.On that this preface might end were the Gospels recently discovered books and had Christ's teaching not suffered eighteen hundred years of false interpretation.But now to understand the teaching of Jesus it is necessary to know clearly the chief methods used in these false interpretations.The most customary method of false interpretation, and one which we have grown up with, consists of preaching under the name of Christianity not what Christ taught but a church teaching composed of explanations of very contradictory writings into which Christ's teaching enters only to a small degree, and even then distorted and twisted to fit together with other writings.According to this false interpretation Christ's teaching is only one link in a chain of revelations beginning with the commencement of the world and continuing in the Church until now.Summarization models summary: 
When I was fifty years old, I questioned the meaning of my life and began to question Christianity.
I had previously believed that life has no meaning for me and that it is an evil, and I wanted to put an end to my life, but I remembered that for a great mass of men who believe and are not corrupted by riches, life has a meaning.
The source of Christian teaching is the Gospels, and in them I found the explanation of the spirit which guides the life of all who really live.
Christian teaching is found in the G.ospels, but it is also found in mud and slime, which I found to be wrongfully united with the pure water of life, Hebrew and Church teaching alien to it.
Christ's teaching has suffered eighteen hundred years of false interpretations.
