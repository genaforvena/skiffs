I’m sick, I’m sick, I’m sick, I’m sick, I’m sick, I’m sick, I’m sick

THE ORIGIN AND VALIDATION OF MICROGLIAL CELLS

Let me finish, I’m going to ask you, I’m going to ask you, I’m going to ask you, I’m going to ask you, I’m going to ask you, I’m going to ask you, I’m going to ask you

Lethal and silent voices of olden days.

Let’s face it: he’s still suffering.

Let there’s a will there’s a way.

Life is sweet, death is bad. I’m waiting for my last breath

My time is up, I’m in a dungeon

How I’ve been chosen to live in the presence of a companion in misfortune

How long will I keep saying these words?

If there’s a will there’s a way.

Let’s give it a go, mate, I’m going to miss you.

How do I say I’m not good at this?

I’m in a cave, I’m in a cave, I’m in a cave, I’m in a cave

Mahood is not there, it’s not there, it’s time to forget everything

Why I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m so good at saying I’m going to try and think again

How do I know I’m talking to the right person at the right time?

A new look at the tumour I’ve been crying about for years.

I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die

Is there a will there’s a way?

I’m begging pardon, I’m asking for it, I’m asking for it, I’m asking for it, I’m asking for it, I’m asking for it

I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’m all right here

Let them come and get me, I’m waiting for them

Let me give you a present, dear dog.

I’m still alive, I’m waiting for them to kill me

I’ll be cursing them, I’ll be damned

Time is running out, dear friends, for I’ll never stop crying.

Let’s face it, I’m waiting for the show to begin, I’m waiting for the show to begin, I’m waiting for the show to begin

I’m waiting for them, I’m waiting for them, I’m waiting for them, I’m waiting for them, I’m waiting for them

I’m not feeling a car. I’m feeling a car.

I’m not mad, I’m just waiting for the right time.

Let me go, I’ll stop screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming, I’ll start screaming again

How long will long solitary tramps live in the rain?

How old is it, how old is it?

I’m not listening to them, I’m doing my mouth

I’m here, I’m here, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there

Fear and I’m doing I’m trying to find out what I’m doing

How I manage to understand something as simple as a lie.

I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it, I’m going to have a go at it’s there

I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume, I resume

Time passes, I’m at it again, I’m at it again, I’m at it again, I’m at it again, I’m at it again, I’m at it again, I’m at it again

A new look at the end of old problems.

Life is sweet, death is bad. I’ve had enough.

I’m not quite sure what I’m missing, but I’m trying to find it

I’m calling it a friend, I’m calling it a foe, I’m calling it a devil.

Air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air, I’ll go on.

Silent I’m going to stop speaking.

The last time I’m going silent.

Silent is silent, I’ll stop talking to you, I’ll go on, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end, I’ll end,

Time to death, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there, I’ve been there

I remember, I can’t see no more, I can’t see no more, I can’t see no more, I can’t see no more, I can’t see no more

Silent is good for me, I’m too tired for my own good

I’m going to go silent for a while, I’m not saying I’m going to go blind for good and bad.

I’d like to see a window in the middle of the funnel.

I’ll never see again, I’ll never see again, I’ll never see again, I’ll never see again

My friend is gone, I’m at the gates of death.

A place I’ve tried to describe to you, but I can’t.

I’ll make my own way there, I’ll put myself in there, I’ll make my own way there

The last time I’ll see you.

Why so many people try to convince me that I’m supposed to be there at the end of life, when I’m not there at all

Let me speak to you, I’m not I, I’m not there, I’m there

How I’m feeling right now, I’m sleeping, I’m not feeling good at all

How many times have I said it’s me, I’m here, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there

I’m not that bad, I’m just trying to forget.

I can’t speak of that voice, I’ve got it.

I’m in something I can’t feel, I’m in something I can’t feel.

My eyes, I’ve tried, I’ve tried, I’ve tried, I’ve tried, I’m done with them

I’m still there, I’m still there, I’m still there, I’m still there

I’m going to miss my daughter, I’m going to miss my son, I’m going to miss my daughter-in-law, I’m going to miss my son-in-law, I’m going to miss my daughter-in-law

The door to the east, the door to the west, the door to the east

I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going to die, I’m going on.

I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time, I’ve been waiting for a long time

I’ve no objection, I’ve already gone there, I’m there, I’m there, I’m there

I’m gone, I’m not going to be the last, I’m going to be the last.

I’m with it, I’m with it, I’m with it, I’m with it

I’ll make it in my head.

I’m not the first person to say I’m not good for me, I’m not the last person to say I’m not good for me

Life is sweet, death is bad, I’ve never said no.

If I’ve lived long enough, I’ve had enough.

My old friend SAM, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’s gone, he’ll never be able to find again

I’m at the door, waiting for the last time I’m with me

I’ll go on, I’ll go on, I’ll go on, I’ll go on, I’ll go on, I’ll go on, I’ll go on, I’ll go on
