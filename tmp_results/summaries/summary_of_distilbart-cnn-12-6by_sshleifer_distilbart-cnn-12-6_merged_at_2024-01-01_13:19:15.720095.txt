 From now say for missaid. Say a body. No back. No bones but say bones. Say remains of mind where none to say . The groan so long on itsway. No. No groan. Simply pain. Simply up. Somehow up and stand. Remains of mind .

 The head as first said missaid. From now one for the kneeling one. As from now two for the twain. The as one plodding twain . Say only such dim light as never.

 In the skull the skull alone to be seen in the dim void . Dimly seen where in the nowhere all together all together are all three together? Dimly . seen by the staring eyes .

 Of all so far missaid the worse missaid. So far so-missaid. Not till nohow worse missay say worsemissaid . Longing that all go. Dim go. Vain longing that vain longing go on .

 Stare outstared away to old man hindtrunk unreceding on. Stare away to child and worsen same. Try better worse kneeling. Say never .
