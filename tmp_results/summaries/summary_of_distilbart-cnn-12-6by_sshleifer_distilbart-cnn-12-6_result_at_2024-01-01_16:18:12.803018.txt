 A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice
 He felt a slight itch on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better . Found where the itch
 It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven . He looked over at the alarm
 The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did
 Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before . As if from deep inside him, there
 Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit of locking all doors at night even when he was at home
 Gregor tried to get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly . He
 He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever
 Gregor lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their natural state . But then he said
 Two strong people would have been more than enough to pull him from the bed and carry him over onto the floor . Should he really call for help though, even apart
 Gregor wondered why did he have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? He swang
 Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too . But as if in gruff reply to
 Gregor Samsa's idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw . He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables
 Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family . The chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa’s
 I'm speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation . I am astonished, quite astonished. I thought
 Gregor was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already . Please, don
 Gregor tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again . He finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower
 The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better . Gregor felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and
 Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair and threw himself onto the door . He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and
 Gregor bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself . As the key turned round he turned around the lock with
 Gregor heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud ‘Oh!’ which sounded like the soughing of the wind . Gregor’s mother,
 Gregor’s father would stretch his breakfast out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers . The washing up from breakfast lay on the table
 It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that's just the right time to remember what’s been achieved in the past . Please
 Chief clerk turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left
 Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme
 Gregor let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the ban
 Gregor made a run for the chief clerk, who had already reached the stairs . His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed engrossed in
 The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well . Until then he had been relatively self controlled,
 If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do
 In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through . Gregor pushed
 Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep when it was dark . He had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the
 Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room . He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was hungrier than he had been that
 Gregor felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents . But what now, if all
 It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out . It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor’
 Gregor passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes
 Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her
 Gregor's injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving . This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly
 Gregor watched with bulging eyes as his sister swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it
 There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way . For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about
 Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than “no thanks, I’ve had enough�
 Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted . He had thought that nothing at all remained from his
 Gregor only remained close to his sister now . Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist . It was his secret plan to
 Despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days . It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime
 Gregor's father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence . During the five years that he had not been working, he had put on a lot of
 Gregor used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this
 His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, the better she was able to
 Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than
 Gregor thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement . Gregor
 Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, so he avoided being seen by his parents . He got into the habit of crawling up and down
 His sister noticed his new way of entertaining himself and decided to remove furniture that got in his way, especially the desk and chest of drawers . She did not dare
 The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place .
 Gregor realised that the lack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused
 His sister, Grete, had become used to the idea that she was Gregor’s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him . This meant
 Gregor’s mother already looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and helped his sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she
 Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that
 Gregor changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first . His attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall of the lady dressed in copious fur
 Grete ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint . Gregor wanted to help too, but he stuck
 Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death . He lay there for a while, numb and immobile,
 Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible . So he
 The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the
 Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots . He knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his
 Gregor froze in shock when an apple flew down and rolled in front of him . There was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him
 The last thing Gregor saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse
 Gregor had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room . But this deterioration in his condition was
 Gregor’s father refused to take his uniform off even at home . The uniform had not been new to start with, but as a result of this it
 Gregor's mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, but nothing would have any effect on him . He would just sink deeper into
 The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed . Several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister
 Gregor’s father brought bank employees breakfast, his mother washed clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers
 Gregor’s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed
 Gregor’s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it . But his mother was to be
 Gregor’s sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her . But even
 Gregor was taken totally by surprise by the charwoman who opened the door slightly every evening and morning and looked briefly in on him . From then on she never failed
 One of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen . They were painfully insistent on things’ being tidy . Unnecessary clutter was something they
 The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in there . The dustbins from the kitchen
 Gregor's mother and sister filled the room with the smell of steaming steaming food . The gentlemen bent over the dishes as if they wanted to test the food
 Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen . The three gentlemen had already finished their meal,
 Gregor’s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother and his sister with the violin . His parents, who had never rented a room out before
 The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing . Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes
 He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one
 The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor . His father seemed
 Gregor’s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants . He urged them and pressed them until
 Gregor’s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out
 Gregor’s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead . She broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her
 If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it’s not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that, and would have gone
 Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister . All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his
 Gregor was crawling through the door of his room when his sister stood up . He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked
 He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust . When the cleaner came in
 Mr. and Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying
 Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: “Just look how thin he was. He didn’t eat anything for so
 Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other . All of them had been crying a little; Grete now
 Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing . As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later
 Mr. Samsa and Grete Samsa were writing a letter to a cleaner in the early hours of the morning . The cleaner stood in the doorway with a smile
 Mr. Samsa and his daughter kissed and hugged each other before they left the flat together . They discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at
