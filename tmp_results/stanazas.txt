Life is sweet, death is fast. I’ve had enough.
Nature, Nurture, or Chance: Is there a need for me to stand up for myself?
Nature or Chance: Is there a need for me to stay in the forest?

I am in my town. I have been there all the time.
My life is in the hands of the wind.

A new look at the end of old problems.
How long have I been waiting for my answer?

The last rites of a young man preparing for his own edification.
I would rather be in prison than in heaven.

My eyes are full, I cannot wait for them to open.
My eyes are opened. I cannot see the floor.

Let me be gone, I’ve been a little bit addicted.
My voice is gone, I’m ready to go silent.

Life is sweet, death is fast. I’ve had enough.
At last I am out of that distant night.
My bed in the early hours of the morning.
The last time I set my teeth in a rubbish dump.

Nature, Nurture, or Chance: Is there a need for me to stand up for myself?
Nature or Chance: Is there a need for me to stay in the forest?
Nature, family, friends and the end of life

A new look at the cracks in the earth: hearing is still there.
The Last Is Coming soon to a Wal-Mart near you
I am climbing towards the gates of death.

My life is black and I have forgotten it all
How long have I been waiting for this SAMCKETT?
This is mine. I have done with blood and I have gone.

My friend is gone, I’m at the gates of death.
A place I’ve tried to describe to you, but I can’t.
I’ll make my own way there, I’ll put myself in there, I’ll make my own way there
